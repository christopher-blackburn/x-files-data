MULDER: Sorry for the run around. Can I buy you a drink?  ,1,1
MULDER: It's not stopping the rest of these people. I got something to show you.  ,1,1
"MULDER: Let's get a table. (Mulder and Scully make their way through the crowded bar. We see many people sitting at the bar, but one particular man seems to be watching Mulder and Scully. Scully is looking through a file, we see a photo of a man, the same man we saw trembling in his home at the start, in a military uniform) That's Colonel Robert Budahas. That photo was taken last year when he was a test pilot for the military, stationed at Ellens Air Base in Southwest Idaho. Four months ago, Colonel Budahas experienced a psychotic episode and barricaded himself in his home. Military police were called in. Budahas was removed and apparently hospitalised with treatment of his condition.  ",1,1
"MULDER: The military will not comment on the cause, nature or status. In fact, the military will not comment on Colonel Budahas at all.  ",1,1
"MULDER: Mrs. Budahas has neither seen nor heard from her husband in over four months. Her inquiries to the military have gone unanswered. Last month, she contacted the FBI and reported it as a kidnapping.  ",1,1
"MULDER: That's the sixty-four thousand dollar question, Scully. (Mulder passes Scully some new information, a thick pile of papers) Since 1963, six pilots have been listed as missing in action, from Ellens Air Base. The military will say only that these pilots accepted the risks of flying experimental aircraft.  ",1,1
"MULDER: There were other rumours too. I've been tracking this case since it came through the Boise regional office last month. Last week, for reasons I can't figure out, it was deprioritised. They shelved this case without an investigation, Scully.  ",1,1
"MULDER: So, you and I, are going to the spud state to investigate a little kidnapping.  ",1,1
"MULDER: Let's just say, this case has a, distinct smell to it, a certain, paranormal bouquet. Excuse me.  ",1,1
MULDER: What?  ,1,1
MULDER: Who are you?  ,1,1
MULDER: How do you know about my work?  ,1,1
MULDER: Who are you? Who do you work for?  ,1,1
MULDER: I can't do that.  ,1,1
"MULDER: Yeah, I'm fine.  ",1,1
MULDER: Hello.  ,1,1
MULDER: Yeah.  ,1,1
MULDER: Uh-huh.  ,1,1
MULDER: Yeah.  ,1,1
"MULDER: Er, listen, I don't want to talk about it on this line. I'll, I'll talk to you about it, on the flight out, OK?  ",1,1
MULDER: Mrs. Budahas?  ,1,1
MULDER: We're from the FBI.  ,1,1
MULDER: What kinds of things?  ,1,1
MULDER: Did he ever talk about his work?  ,1,1
"MULDER: Eeh, you said word gets around, I'm sorry, erm, have you ever heard of this, happening to anyone else?  ",1,1
"MULDER: Mrs. McLennen, has anyone ever offered to explain what caused this?  ",1,1
MULDER: So what did you make of Uncle Fester down the block?  ,1,1
"MULDER: Yeah, but these guys aren't zoo animals, they're test pilots. They're not supposed to fold under pressure, they're supposed to thrive on it.  ",1,1
"MULDER: Yeah, that's the, er, unacknowledged codename for some new kind of defence department, surveillance project.  ",1,1
"MULDER: You saw the photos on the wall in there. This guy Budahas received a presidential commodation, he's never washed out of anything in his life.  ",1,1
"MULDER: I've been on hold with the base director of communications for fourty-five minutes, how about you?  ",1,1
"MULDER: Yeah, right. (Mulder lifts up a telephone directory) Did you say Kissel?  ",1,1
MULDER: Colonel Kissel?  ,1,1
"MULDER: Can I talk with you? Special Agent Mulder, FBI.  ",1,1
MULDER: Why don't you talk to us about Colonel Budahas?  ,1,1
MULDER: We're just looking around.  ,1,1
MULDER: We're not at liberty to comment.  ,1,1
"MULDER: Paul? Right? You've lived in this area a while, you ever seen a UFO?  ",1,1
"MULDER: But, if I wanted to talk to those UFO nuts, that you refered to earlier, where would I go?  ",1,1
MULDER: Who's the photographer?  ,1,1
"MULDER: You're kidding, where?  ",1,1
MULDER: Put it on my tab.  ,1,1
"MULDER: What would the chances be, of someone like me, seeing a UFO?  ",1,1
MULDER: I know. Let's go.  ,1,1
"MULDER: We got our own map, sucker.  ",1,1
"MULDER: I don't know, maybe nothing.  ",1,1
"MULDER: Scully, wake up. You've gotta see this.  ",1,1
"MULDER: I don't know, just keep watching it's unbelievable.  ",1,1
MULDER: They've been going at it like that for almost half an hour.  ,1,1
MULDER: What else could they be?  ,1,1
MULDER: Here comes another one.  ,1,1
MULDER: Hey.  ,1,1
MULDER: Stay right there.  ,1,1
MULDER: Come on.  ,1,1
"MULDER: Let's go, you're coming with us.  ",1,1
MULDER: Were you ever chased out before?  ,1,1
MULDER: What do you think they are?  ,1,1
MULDER: Do they look anything like this?  ,1,1
MULDER: Later Dude!  ,1,1
"MULDER: Evidence. (Mulder puts the tape in the stereo and the sound of heavy metal guitar music fills the car. Scully turns it off) Kids today, huh.  ",1,1
MULDER: Why wouldn't I?  ,1,1
"MULDER: Ho-hoo. If you were that stoned, what.  ",1,1
"MULDER: Alright, I wanna show you something. (Mulder reaches into the back seat of the car and lifts a folder, he opens it and takes out a photo, which he gives to Scully) This is a photo, of a UFO that reportedly crashed in Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. Now I know, you don't believe that story but just hear me out. Now, Ellens Air Base, the same base that we're at right now, the same base, that for some strange reason, doesn't appear on your US government map, is supposedly, one of the six sites where parts from the wreckage were shipped.  ",1,1
"MULDER: No, planes built, using UFO technology.  ",1,1
"MULDER: Tell me, there isn't a remarkable resemblance.  ",1,1
MULDER: You saw exactly what I saw in the sky tonight. What do you think they were?  ,1,1
"MULDER: Unidentified Flying Objects, I think that fits the description pretty well. Tell me I'm crazy.  ",1,1
"MULDER: You didn't come to raid my mini-bar, did ye?  ",1,1
MULDER: What?  ,1,1
"MULDER: Mrs. Budahas, are you ok?  ",1,1
MULDER: What? What's wrong?  ,1,1
"MULDER: It's ok, it's ok, just relax, wel, I'm Special Agent Mulder, from the FBI. We're out here investigating your disappearance Colonel Budahas. Wondering if you have any explanation of your whereabouts over the past four months.  ",1,1
"MULDER: Here, on base?  ",1,1
"MULDER: Colonel Budahas, do you mind if I ask you your birthdate?  ",1,1
MULDER: And the names of your kids?  ,1,1
MULDER: Green Bay fan.  ,1,1
"MULDER: Bet you remember the Superbowl of 68, huh? Don Shandler.  ",1,1
"MULDER: Colonel, Colonel Budahas, you're a, a pilot, isn't that right?  ",1,1
"MULDER: Bet you've flown just about everything with two wings. I got this hotshot pilot friend, who said that he could do Immelmann at a sustained eight g's, huh, is that possible?  ",1,1
MULDER: I think they re-wired that man's brain. Some kind of selective memory drain.  ,1,1
MULDER: Then you explain it to me.  ,1,1
"MULDER: This is not amnesia, I think it's something far more deliberate and insidious.  ",1,1
"MULDER: And neither does the technology to fly the aircraft we saw last night. Listen to me Scully, they can do this. That man, he should have known the answer to the question, it just wasn't in his head anymore.  ",1,1
"MULDER: To control information. I think that after his psychotic episode, Colonel Budahas became a security risk.  ",1,1
"MULDER: No, I think that men like Colonel Budahas are physiologically incapable of dealing with the stress of flying the aircraft we saw. Or doing those manoeuvres, at those speeds. I mean we're talking about a technology that is so sensitive and advanced, that it's taken almost fifty years to make it work. UFO technology, Scully.  ",1,1
MULDER: Hold on.  ,1,1
"MULDER: You think if maybe we ignore him, he'll go away?  ",1,1
"MULDER: Guess not. (Mulder gets out of the car) Special Agent Mulder, FBI.  ",1,1
MULDER: You wanna tell me what this is about.  ,1,1
"MULDER: I don't think it was those kids they were chasing away from the base last night, I think it was us. They knew we were coming before we ever arrived. And they returned Colonel Budahas as a decoy. There's something I didn't tell you, Scully.  ",1,1
"MULDER: I was approached by a man in D.C. who warned me to stay away from this case, he didn't give me his name, and my phone was being tapped.  ",1,1
"MULDER: Why would they go to all this trouble? Out of a need for security. Security of what? I think there's a huge conspiracy here Scully. They've got a UFO here, I'm sure of it. And they'll do anything to keep it a secret, including sacrificing lives and minds of those pilots, because what if that secret got out.  ",1,1
"MULDER: No no, you're not thinking big enough, if it were true, it would be confirmation of the existence of extra terrestrial life.  ",1,1
"MULDER: Yes, but at what cost, when does the human cost become too high for the building of a better machine?  ",1,1
"MULDER: Aren't you even curious? (Scully takes the photo from Mulder and sits down) Aaerm, I gonna shower, I'll pack and then, we'll get outta here.  ",1,1
"MULDER: Hey, aren't you guys coming?  ",1,1
"MULDER: Ok, this spot you told me about where you watch the air show, how far is it?  ",1,1
MULDER: Will I be able to find it?  ,1,1
"MULDER: And what about this other place you told me about, Yellow Base, where they hangar them.  ",1,1
MULDER: Nooo.  ,1,1
MULDER: I think so. Scully I...  ,1,1
MULDER: How did I get here?  ,1,1
MULDER: Hi.  ,1,1
MULDER: We came by to see how your husband was doing.  ,1,1
"MULDER: Do you think, maybe, we could see him.  ",1,1
"MULDER: They got to her Scully. They were here, they must have threatened her and Budahas..  ",1,1
MULDER: Why?  ,1,1
MULDER: I saw something I...  ,1,1
MULDER: What is your interest?  ,1,1
"MULDER: I did see something, but it's gone, they took it from me, they erased it. You have to tell me what it was.  ",1,1
"MULDER: Because, all the evidence to the contrary, is not entirely dissuasive.  ",1,1
"MULDER: They're here, aren't they?  ",1,1
MULDER: So why didn't they ask me?  ,1,2
MULDER: Why would I make them so uncomfortable?  ,1,2
MULDER: Reputation? I have a reputation?  ,1,2
MULDER: Spooky? Do you think I'm spooky?  ,1,2
MULDER: Grey.  ,1,2
"MULDER: Grey. You said green men, a Reticulan skin tone is actually grey, they're notorious for their extraction of terrestrial human livers. Due to iron depletion in the Reticulan galaxy.  ",1,2
MULDER: Do you have any idea what liver and onions go for on Reticula? `scuse me.  ,1,2
"MULDER: This is the print I took yesterday from Usher's office, these others are from an X-file. Ten murders, Baltimore area, undetermined points of entry, each victim had their liver removed. These prints were discovered at five of the ten crime scenes.  ",1,2
"MULDER: Most likely, he's not aware of them. These two prints were lifted five years before he was born at Powhatan Mill. And these three were lifted probably, five years before his mother was even born.  ",1,2
"MULDER: And fingerprinting was just coming into it's own in 1903, but there was a murder involving an extracted liver.  ",1,2
MULDER: Now that's five murders every thirty years. That makes two more to go this year.  ,1,2
"MULDER: What did we learn in our first day at the academy, Scully? Each fingerprint is unique, these are a perfect match.  ",1,2
"MULDER: No, of course not, I find no evidence of alien involvement.  ",1,2
MULDER: And he should stick out in a crowd with ten inch fingers.  ,1,2
"MULDER: Our X-file dates back to 1903, we had it first.  ",1,2
"MULDER: You're down here too. Look, why don't we agree to this, they'll have their investigation, we'll have ours and never the twain shall meet. Agreed?  ",1,2
"MULDER: You wouldn't shoot an unarmed man, would ya copper?  ",1,2
"MULDER: He's not coming back here, his thrill is derived from the challenge of unseemingly impossible entry. He's already beaten this place, if you'd read the X-file on the case, you'd come to the same conclusion.  ",1,2
MULDER: Seeds?  ,1,2
MULDER: In there.  ,1,2
MULDER: You were right.  ,1,2
MULDER: I had her ask it.  ,1,2
"MULDER: Scully's right, it is the guy.  ",1,2
"MULDER: He lied on questions eleven and thirteen, his electrodermal and cardiographic response nearly go off the chart.  ",1,2
"MULDER: Two murders with matching mo's occurred in Powhatan Mill in 1933, just look at the chart.  ",1,2
MULDER: He's the guy.  ,1,2
"MULDER: Maybe I thought you caught the right guy. And maybe I run into so many people, who are hostile, just because they can't open their minds to the possibilties, that sometimes the need to mess with their heads, outweighs the millstone of humiliation.  ",1,2
"MULDER: Of course I was, in our investigations, you may not always agree with me but at least you respect the journey. And if you wanna continue working with them, I won't hold it against ye.  ",1,2
MULDER: These are Eugene Tooms' prints.  ,1,2
"MULDER: Only thing I know for certain is, they let him go.  ",1,2
"MULDER: What's the matter Colton, you worried I'm gonna solve your case?  ",1,2
MULDER: It's Tooms.  ,1,2
"MULDER: I found him. How do we learn about the present, we look to the past. I think this is where it all began in 1903 on Exeter Street.  ",1,2
"MULDER: Maybe, his neighbour played the victrola too loud.  ",1,2
MULDER: What about the prints?  ,1,2
"MULDER: So what is this, the Anti-Waltons.  ",1,2
"MULDER: I think what we have to do is track Eugene Tooms, there's four down and one to go this year. If we don't get him right now, the next chance is in year.....  ",1,2
"MULDER: And you're gonna be head of the bureau by then. So I think you have to go through the census, I'm gonna plough through this century's marriage, birth, death certificates, and... You have any dramamine on you by any chance cos, these things make me seasick.  ",1,2
"MULDER: Never was born, never married, never died.  ",1,2
"MULDER: Feel what, Frank?  ",1,2
"MULDER: Have you ever heard the name, Eugene Victor Tooms?  ",1,2
MULDER: 66 Exeter Street?  ,1,2
"MULDER: The old man was right, you can feel it.  ",1,2
MULDER: Check this out.  ,1,2
MULDER: Somebody having a garage sale.  ,1,2
MULDER: Does he live in here?  ,1,2
"MULDER: No, somebody made it.  ",1,2
MULDER: Is there any way I can get it off my fingers quickly without betraying my cool exterior?  ,1,2
"MULDER: I don't think it's where he lives, I think it's where he hibernates.  ",1,2
"MULDER: Just listen, what if some genetic mutation could allow a man to awaken every thirty years.  ",1,2
"MULDER: And what if the five livers could provide him sustenance for that period. What if Tooms is some kind of, twentieth century, genetic mutant.  ",1,2
MULDER: Well we're gonna need a surveillance team.  ,1,2
"MULDER: Well you go down town and see what you can fannagle, I'll keep watch.  ",1,2
MULDER: It's about time.  ,1,2
"MULDER: Eugene Tooms, he's unarmed but consider him dangerous. Scully and I'll be back to relieve you in eight hours if he doesn't show, right here.  ",1,2
MULDER: Where is everyone? Scully?  ,1,2
MULDER: Dammit.  ,1,2
"MULDER: Dammit, ANSWER.  ",1,2
MULDER: SCULLY!  ,1,2
"MULDER: Look at him, he's building another nest.  ",1,2
"MULDER: All these people putting bars on their windows, spending good money on hi-tech security systems, trying to feel safe. I look at this guy and I think, ""It ain't enough"".  ",1,2
"MULDER: Ok Scully, so we disagree, it's not the first time and it won't be the last.  ",1,3
"MULDER: This is the essence of science, you ask an impertinent question and you're on your way to a pertinent answer.  ",1,3
"MULDER: Because, the lizard baby, wasn't born anywhere near Lake Okobogee.  ",1,3
MULDER: Bogee. (Mulders get up and talks right into Scully's face) Okobogee.  ,1,3
"MULDER: If you know anything about trout fishing, or UFO hotspots.  ",1,3
"MULDER: Four sightings in 1967, August, including one by a national weather service plane. (Mulder clicks to a bigger picture of the UFO) This is a light blasted, digitally enhanced enlargement.  ",1,3
"MULDER: Try a girl scout with an instamatic. Four of the nine girls in the troupe claim to have seen something, five if you include the den mother. The Air Force said it was a weather balloon caught in a wind sheer. But there wasn't a weather balloon launched that day within seven hundred miles. (Mulder turns off the slide projector and gets a file which he gives to Scully) Now read me the names of those girl scouts from 1967.  ",1,3
MULDER: It's the same Darlene Morris.  ,1,3
"MULDER: Summer of 1967, the girl scout troupe?  ",1,3
"MULDER: Your name's on record at the center for UFO studies in Evanston, Illinois.  ",1,3
"MULDER: Yea, pilot for the national weather service made a similar sighting over the same area on the same day.  ",1,3
"MULDER: You, you said that erm, Kevin was there, the night it happened.  ",1,3
MULDER: Do you think I might talk to him anyway? (Darlene nods her head) Thanks.  ,1,3
MULDER: Hey buddy! Mind if I sit down? (Kevin shrugs his shoulders) Thanks. (Mulder sits on the end of a coffee table) Your mom tells me you've been having nightmares.  ,1,3
MULDER: Wanna tell me about `em?  ,1,3
MULDER: Alright. (Mulder notices Kevin is writing on a pad) Whatta you doing? (Kevin turns round to look at Mulder and then turns back to his pad and continues writing) Are you making something? (Kevin nods his head) Can I take a look at it? (Kevin lifts his pad and passes it to Mulder) Thanks.  ,1,3
MULDER: The TV?  ,1,3
"MULDER: I don't know what it is, maybe a binary sequence of some kind. Could be anything, could be nothing. I know you're busy, look erm, I know a friend who knows a friend who knows a friend who-oo can get you tickets to a Redskins game. You got it. Alright, you know where to find me? Thanks Danny.  ",1,3
MULDER: You assume she ran away.  ,1,3
"MULDER: Well, how do you explain what her mother saw?  ",1,3
MULDER: So basically you ignored her statement.  ,1,3
MULDER: But you didn't bother to check it out.  ,1,3
MULDER: Before what?  ,1,3
MULDER: Who me? I'm Mr. Congeniality.  ,1,3
MULDER: I'll send him a bunt cake.  ,1,3
MULDER: Like the night she disappeared?  ,1,3
MULDER: Who's Greg?  ,1,3
MULDER: What kind of stuff?  ,1,3
MULDER: `scuse me. Do you know where we could find Greg Randall?  ,1,3
"MULDER: Actually, we were hoping you could tell us.  ",1,3
MULDER: Any ideas where he might have gone?  ,1,3
"MULDER: Hey, that's a nice tattoo, what is that?  ",1,3
MULDER: Flying saucer. You don't really believe in that stuff do ya?  ,1,3
"MULDER: No, I think it's all just a bunch of crazy people howling at the moon.  ",1,3
"MULDER: No I haven't, why?  ",1,3
"MULDER: Well, if you explain to me what you're talking about, maybe I can help you out. (The fourth man hands a sheet of paper to Mulder) This is a document? Just looks like a bunch of ones and zeroes to me.  ",1,3
MULDER: Tell me what it is.  ,1,3
"MULDER: It's your call Holtzman. So unless they tell me otherwise, I'm not accountable to anybody outside my sub-committee. I don't care if it's the NSA or the Vatican Police.  ",1,3
MULDER: You're kidding.  ,1,3
"MULDER: Well sure, I'll let you know as soon as I find out.  ",1,3
MULDER: Great.  ,1,3
MULDER: You shouldn't have told them. They have no jurisdiction.  ,1,3
"MULDER: C'mon, how could an eight year old boy, who can bearly multiply, be a threat to national security? People call me paranoid.  ",1,3
MULDER: You guys do really delicate work.  ,1,3
MULDER: I'm not sure.  ,1,3
"MULDER: Almost like someone's switching channels, huh.  ",1,3
MULDER: Mrs. Morris.  ,1,3
"MULDER: Mrs. Morris, please give me a minute to explain.  ",1,3
"MULDER: But your son, has seen something.  ",1,3
"MULDER: The boy's the key Scully, I know it.  ",1,3
"MULDER: Finding Ruby. Just think about it for a minute, this is a boy who is receiving all kinds of digitised data from a television screen.  ",1,3
MULDER: No.  ,1,3
"MULDER: I think that Kevin is a conduit, of some kind.  ",1,3
"MULDER: A link, or a connection, to whoever, or whatever, took Ruby that night.  ",1,3
"MULDER: If there was an abduction, it's likely that Kevin was touched in some way.  ",1,3
MULDER: That's why we're going to Lake Okobogee.  ,1,3
"MULDER: According to the police photos, Ruby and Kevin were sleeping right here.  ",1,3
MULDER: Meaning what?  ,1,3
"MULDER: Have you noticed the tree line? (Mulder points up to the trees, the leaves and burnt away from the tops and only the thin trunk remains) Evidence of extreme heat.  ",1,3
"MULDER: That's true. (Mulder is cleaning the sand of the glass) Do you think a lightning strike could've caused this? (Mulder walks towards Scully with the piece of glass) Do you have any idea at what temperature sand solidifies into glass? (He gives it to Scully, who rubs the hardened sand on it) Twenty-five hundred degrees fahrenheit. Something was out here Scully, something hot enough to turn sand into glass, that, singed those trees and to blister the roof of that camper.  ",1,3
"MULDER: It's a grave. Shallow, by the smell of it.  ",1,3
MULDER: What if it's her? I need to know.  ,1,3
MULDER: Fine.  ,1,3
"MULDER: Before you put that away, can I take a look at it?  ",1,3
"MULDER: Sure you were Tessa. (Mulder walks towards Tessa) You knew they were meeting, so you sat there and you waited for them. You were angry and you were jealous.  ",1,3
"MULDER: You sat there and you waited and when they showed, you killed him first, isn't that how it went?  ",1,3
"MULDER: You snuck up from behind him and you shot him in the back, (Mulder hits the desk with his hand) BAAMMM. (Mulder walks around the desk and stands beside Tessa) And then you killed Ruby, (Mulder hits the desk again) BAAMMM. (Mulder walks to the other side of Tessa) What was she doing right before she died Tessa? Was she pleading for her life? Was she running away?  ",1,3
MULDER: Where's she buried Tessa?  ,1,3
MULDER: You don't know where you buried her Tessa.  ,1,3
MULDER: You didn't?  ,1,3
"MULDER: Well how would you know that Tessa, if you weren't there yourself.  ",1,3
MULDER: Which is?  ,1,3
MULDER: Is that your conclusion or the conclusion of the Sioux City Sheriff's Department?  ,1,3
MULDER: They're wasting their time.  ,1,3
"MULDER: Why not, what if Ruby never did show up that night?  ",1,3
MULDER: Because something was out there in those woods.  ,1,3
MULDER: I can't do that.  ,1,3
MULDER: To talk to the boy.  ,1,3
"MULDER: Well, I've gotta see him.  ",1,3
"MULDER: Come with me or don't come with me but until they find a body, I'm not giving up on that girl.  ",1,3
"MULDER: Hello? (Mulder notices the door is unlocked, enters the house. Scully is right behind him) Mrs. Morris?  ",1,3
MULDER: I don't know.  ,1,3
MULDER: What is it?  ,1,3
"MULDER: You know when I was a kid, I had this ritual. I closed my eyes before I walked into my room, cause I thought that one day when I opened them my sister would be there. Just lying in bed, like nothing ever happened. You know I'm still walking into that room, everyday of my life. (Mulder notices something up ahead) Scully. (Scully looks to see what it is, it's Darlene's camper van. They pull up behind it and get out of the car. They run to the van) DARLENE!  ",1,3
MULDER: Are you ok?  ,1,3
MULDER: Where's Kevin?  ,1,3
MULDER: KEVIN!  ,1,3
"MULDER: Kevin I'm sorry but, I don't...  ",1,3
"MULDER: Kevin I don't think she is. I know how much you want it to be her, I did too.  ",1,3
MULDER: SCULLY!  ,1,3
MULDER: I'll get help.  ,1,3
MULDER: Any ideas what caused the coma?  ,1,3
MULDER: By any chance was there attendant reduction in the lymphocyte population or a release of gluco-cordacoids?  ,1,3
MULDER: They're symptoms of prolonged weightlessness. Shuttle astronauts have reported similar imbalances.  ,1,3
MULDER: Where were you Ruby? Can you tell us?  ,1,3
"MULDER: Who told you? (Ruby is afraid to say anything) Ruby, who told you?  ",1,3
"MULDER: I know how dis-oriented she must seem right now, but in a couple of weeks, maybe even a few days, we could..  ",1,3
"MULDER: She should be encouraged to tell her story, not to keep it inside, it's important that you let her.  ",1,3
"MULDER: But she will remember one day, one way or another, even if it's only in dreams. And when she does, she's gonna wanna talk about it, she's gonna need to talk about it.  ",1,3
MULDER: But it was the truth Darlene.  ,1,3
MULDER: It doesn't have to be that way for Ruby.  ,1,3
MULDER: Is that what you're gonna tell Kevin?  ,1,3
"MULDER: Yeah, they're open but it's like, nothing's happening.  ",1,3
MULDER: I can't.  ,1,3
"MULDER: I don't know. I can't move, so I don't...(We see a close-up of the tape being played, on it it says: F. Mulder hypnotic regression tape session number 2B: June 16) I just lie there in bed.  ",1,3
"MULDER: No, but I can hear her.  ",1,3
"MULDER: She's calling out my name, over and over again. (We see the picture is one of Mulder and his sister when they were kids. We see it is Mulder who is now holding the picture) She's crying out for help but I can't help her. I can't move. (We see that Mulder is sitting inside a church)  ",1,3
MULDER: I know I should be but I'm not.  ,1,3
MULDER: Because of the voice.  ,1,3
MULDER: The voice in my head.  ,1,3
"MULDER: Not to be afraid. It's telling me no harm will come to her, and that one day she'll return.  ",1,3
MULDER: I want to believe.  ,1,3
MULDER: This woman claims to have been taken aboard a spaceship and held in an anti-gravity chamber without food and water for three days.  ,1,4
MULDER: What's that?  ,1,4
MULDER: Where in New Jersey?  ,1,4
MULDER: Not an uncommon place to lose a body part. They think it's the mob?  ,1,4
MULDER: You feeling lucky Scully?  ,1,4
MULDER: Ever hear of something called The Jersey Devil?  ,1,4
MULDER: Read the file about the case in 1947.  ,1,4
"MULDER: 1947, family watches dad get dragged off into the woods, cops find dad with a few appendages gnawed off. Cops corner a large naked man in the woods and gun `im down. (They stop at a desk) Autopsy shows human flesh and bones in the man's large intestine. A beast man. (Mulder talks to someone behind the desk) Requisition for a car please.  ",1,4
"MULDER: No, the original disappeared from the Patterson PD's files a few years after the incident. But there is a statement from the attending pathologist.  ",1,4
"MULDER: I heard the same story when I was a kid too, funny thing is, I believed it. (Mulder hands back the form to the person behind the desk and is given a set of keys) Thanks Doreen. (Mulder turns to face Scully) Fact is, we got a cannibalised body in New Jersey, someone or something out there is hungry.  ",1,4
MULDER: Who found the body?  ,1,4
MULDER: Any ideas about that?  ,1,4
"MULDER: Well we're not here on an official capacity, Agent Scully's a medical doctor, we heard about your victim and, she thought she might take a look.  ",1,4
MULDER: Any suspects yet Detective?  ,1,4
MULDER: There's no need to get bent outta shape.  ,1,4
MULDER: So what's eating that guy?  ,1,4
"MULDER: Yeah, chances are he's without a clue. He'll probably be scratching his head when they bring the next body in.  ",1,4
"MULDER: Hey whatta you say, we grab a hotel, take in a floor show, drop a few quarters in the slot, do a little digging on this case.  ",1,4
"MULDER: Ok, we can skip the floor show.  ",1,4
MULDER: What you gotta date?  ,1,4
"MULDER: A little poking around, maybe make a weekend out of it.  ",1,4
"MULDER: Victim was a homeless man, you get many of them wandering around out here?  ",1,4
MULDER: Scared? Of what?  ,1,4
MULDER: People say that's just a myth.  ,1,4
MULDER: What do you think?  ,1,4
MULDER: Really. You never saw him again?  ,1,4
MULDER: You think it might be what's responsible for the body you found?  ,1,4
MULDER: Yeah.  ,1,4
MULDER: How far is it into town from here?  ,1,4
"MULDER: I'm staying at the Galaxy Gateway for the next couple of days, if you think of anything, will you call me?  ",1,4
"MULDER: Did anybody here know Roger Crockett? (No one acknowledges Mulder's request) He was murdered two days ago. (Mulder tries to talk to a woman as she goes passed but she just ignores him) Ma'am, can I..  ",1,4
MULDER: Roger Crockett? Anybody?  ,1,4
MULDER: Did you know Roger Crockett? (The man nods his head) Did you hear how he died?  ,1,4
MULDER: Any ideas who might've done it?  ,1,4
"MULDER: No, I'm FBI.  ",1,4
MULDER: Ok.  ,1,4
MULDER: What is this?  ,1,4
MULDER: Does it mean anything to you?  ,1,4
MULDER: Where?  ,1,4
MULDER: Here? Are you hustling me?  ,1,4
MULDER: Who do you think it is?  ,1,4
MULDER: Has anybody else seen it?  ,1,4
MULDER: Anybody told the cops?  ,1,4
MULDER: Where're you sleeping tonight?  ,1,4
"MULDER: You know the er, The Galaxy Gateway? (Mulder gives Jack his room key) Room 756. Go ahead.  ",1,4
"MULDER: Yeah, they do.  ",1,4
MULDER: You got a man up on that roof.  ,1,4
MULDER: Hey back off.  ,1,4
"MULDER: I'm telling you, there's a man up on that roof.  ",1,4
MULDER: Enjoying the night life here in beautiful Atlantic City.  ,1,4
"MULDER: That's good, let's go see her together, and while we're at it, why don't we add withholding evidence to the list.  ",1,4
MULDER: Statements given to you describing something stalking the back streets of Atlantic City.  ,1,4
MULDER: Why else would you be sweeping the streets tonight? You know it's out there.  ,1,4
"MULDER: Oh is that your job, or is it to keep the dice rolling, keep the tour buses rolling in. You can't fill those casinos, this town disappears like a quarter down the slot. (There is a brief pause of silence) I've seen it.  ",1,4
"MULDER: Who's going to be responsible when you lose your first tourist, Detective? You are.  ",1,4
MULDER: I'm not far from where you left me.  ,1,4
"MULDER: Er Scully, you got anything happening this morning?  ",1,4
MULDER: That's a guy getting sick.  ,1,4
MULDER: You gonna rag on me or you gonna take me to get something to eat?  ,1,4
"MULDER: It moved like a cat, quick and graceful. There's no way a human could've got up on the roof that fast.  ",1,4
MULDER: What?  ,1,4
"MULDER: They dropped the charges, that guy Thompson, he ran me through the system just to spite me.  ",1,4
"MULDER: I saw it, it's exactly the way the ranger described it, the way it moved, the way it sniffed the air. It's come out of the woods, probably in search of food.  ",1,4
"MULDER: It was peeking through the garbage Scully, if it was a man-eater, why didn't it come after me? Probably felt threatened in some way..  ",1,4
"MULDER: But you do believe that I saw something, don't ye?  ",1,4
MULDER: I still got a hotel room I'm paying for.  ,1,4
MULDER: Another birthday party?  ,1,4
MULDER: Can you cancel?  ,1,4
MULDER: I have a life!  ,1,4
MULDER: Why is that?  ,1,4
MULDER: What's this chart?  ,1,4
MULDER: Why?  ,1,4
MULDER: So we kill other species in order to survive.  ,1,4
MULDER: But what if something entered the food chain above us?  ,1,4
"MULDER: But, but what if through some fluke of nature, a human was born, who reverted to it's most animal instincts, a kind of carnivorous neanderthal. Wouldn't he occupy a space above us on the food chain?  ",1,4
"MULDER: Right, yeah, an.and, and haven't there been cases were, men have been raised in the wilderness by animals who have no language and hunt like predators?  ",1,4
MULDER: But even when faced with extinction?  ,1,4
"MULDER: Yea, highly unlikely, but not outside the realm of extreme possibility?  ",1,4
MULDER: Mulder.  ,1,4
"MULDER: Oh yeah, hi.  ",1,4
MULDER: Where's the body now?  ,1,4
MULDER: You're sure it was a male?  ,1,4
MULDER: Scully.  ,1,4
MULDER: Sorry to interrupt your evening.  ,1,4
"MULDER: I just had an amazing thought, maybe it isn't a beast-man we're looking for after all.  ",1,4
MULDER: They're going to try and sweep this whole thing under the carpet.  ,1,4
"MULDER: Any publicity and you're got the streets crawling with the kind of people who aren't here to play the crap tables. Word gets out there's something still on the loose, forget it.  ",1,4
"MULDER: The body they found was a male, there's a fifty-fifty chance there was a mate. We may never know unless we find out ourselves.  ",1,4
MULDER: This thing has no fear of heights. We'll stay together and start with the lower floors. How much time will that dart give us?  ,1,4
MULDER: What if it is a female Scully? How close is she to you or me? Does she feel emotion? Or are her days just spent looking for food?  ,1,4
"MULDER: Eight million years out of Africa, I don't think we're all that different.  ",1,4
"MULDER: While we over-populate the world and create new technologies to kill each other with. Maybe we're just beasts with big brains. (Scully is standing, not moving, a still face gazing into nothingness) What?  ",1,4
MULDER: Scully.  ,1,4
"MULDER: You should've seen her, she was beautiful.  ",1,4
"MULDER: She could've torn my head off Scully but she didn't, she sensed that I wasn't a threat..  ",1,4
MULDER: What?  ,1,4
MULDER: What?  ,1,4
"MULDER: Well tell him he's got a real live neanderthal on the loose. She was young, I, I, I don't know...It's hard to say exactly what, what, what...  ",1,4
"MULDER: That is such crap, you can..  ",1,4
MULDER: Let's go.  ,1,4
MULDER: You could take her alive.  ,1,4
MULDER: Can you reach her from here?  ,1,4
MULDER: Why did you have to kill her?  ,1,4
MULDER: Good luck.  ,1,4
MULDER: There would have been offspring.  ,1,4
"MULDER: She was just protecting her children Scully, it all makes sense. (Mulder gets up and gets his coat from behind the door) The male dies and she comes out of the woods in search of food.  ",1,4
"MULDER: Thanks for the offer but I've got an appointment at the Smithsonian with.. (The phone rings)...an ethno-biologist, I can't wait to tell him about this. (Mulder answers the phone) Mulder, yeah just a second, it's for you.  ",1,4
MULDER: Requisition for a car please Fran. Thank you. (Mulder is filling out the form when Scully arrives) Who was that on the phone?  ,1,4
MULDER: A guy. Same guy as the guy you had dinner with the other night?  ,1,4
MULDER: You gonna have dinner with him again?  ,1,4
MULDER: No interest?  ,1,4
MULDER: Thanks Fran. (Mulder walks away from the desk and towards a door. Scully walks with him) What are you doing?  ,1,4
MULDER: Don't you have a life Scully?  ,1,4
MULDER: Eight million years out of Africa.  ,1,4
"MULDER: You're not FBI, are you?  ",1,5
"MULDER: Time of death? (She doesn't answer, just looks at the other two in the corner.)  ",1,5
"MULDER: Where did you find them? (No answer) Look, at least tell us the mode of transport. That might tell us why the bodies haven't cooled. (Still no answer from them) Hey, you called us down here. If you want some answers you have to give some. (The man finally answers)  ",1,5
MULDER: Thank you.  ,1,5
MULDER: Who are these guys? (No answer)  ,1,5
"MULDER: Ah, uh. Never.  ",1,5
MULDER: I'd say you people already suffer from full denial. (Mulder and Scully leave)  ,1,5
MULDER: I would never lie. I willfully participated in a campaign of misinformation.  ,1,5
"MULDER: NSA, CIA, some convert organization Congress will uncover in the next scandal. It's not important who they are but what they have and I'm sure they have no idea because they pulled us in. I have X Files. Each case with an element of what we saw tonight. Residual electrostatic charge, internal mutilation without any external  causality - but none has all the elements combined in one case.  ",1,5
MULDER: Psychokinetic manipulation.  ,1,5
MULDER: The Russians were doing studies on it. The Chinese still are. Their findings are kept secret. (They get into an elevator)  ,1,5
MULDER: That's 60 air minutes.  ,1,5
MULDER: There. Back up.  ,1,5
MULDER: Look at that. (He stops the film and there is a ghostly flash across the screen. Hovering over them.)  ,1,5
"MULDER: Maybe, maybe not.  ",1,5
MULDER: That leaves only one person we know we can talk to.  ,1,5
"MULDER: Miss Lauren Kyte, please. (She opens the door and Mulder flashes his badge.) I'm Agent Fox Mulder and this is Agent Dana Scully. We're with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Do you mind if we come in?  ",1,5
MULDER: Thank you. We won't be long.  ,1,5
MULDER: Can you tell us what happened that night?  ,1,5
MULDER: They were found dead. (She has a reaction. Scully gives her another picture)  ,1,5
MULDER: Does that mean you know?  ,1,5
"MULDER: When you can tell me, this is the number where I can be reached at anytime, ok?  ",1,5
MULDER: And somehow crushing their necks? (They get into the car and put on their seatbelts. Lauren is seen looking at them through her window.)  ,1,5
"MULDER: Packing, running away, from what? ( The parking brake goes off, the car is put into reverse, and the doors are locked. Mulder tries to brake, put the car spins backward.)  ",1,5
"MULDER: Hang on! (He turns around and steers the car speeding backward, trying to brake. The car is hit in the intersection by another car. It comes to a stop) You ok?  ",1,5
MULDER: Hi. The paramedics check you out?  ,1,5
MULDER: Mine's more IRS sized.  ,1,5
"MULDER: Yeah, it's brand new. Only a 100 miles.  ",1,5
"MULDER: Mechanic said everything is in proper order. Nothing cut, nothing greased. Check out the lights.  ",1,5
MULDER: They're not. The filaments are heated due to massive levels of electrostatic charge. Just like the bodies at the morgue. And isn't it interesting that Lauren Kyte was present at both incidents?  ,1,5
MULDER: What if it's possible somehow to raise a body's electrostatic charge to levels we've been seeing and use that energy to affect objects?  ,1,5
"MULDER: Well there's evidence of this all through the X Files. Furniture moving untouched, objects levitating, unexplained electrical discharges. Frequently people who have psychokinetic power are unaware of their own capability.  ",1,5
MULDER: Either that or a poltergeist.  ,1,5
MULDER: They may be.  ,1,5
"MULDER: A little upset over losing a parking space, wouldn't you say? So, who is Howard Graves anyway?  ",1,5
MULDER: She was his secretary. That's three people dead in the last month all associated with Lauren Kyte. (The newspaper article says Howard slashed his wrists in a bathtub.)  ,1,5
"MULDER: Excuse me, Sir? Is there an office here so that I can get information on those people?  ",1,5
MULDER: Do you know how Sarah Lynn is related to Howard Graves?  ,1,5
"MULDER: Thank you, Sir.  ",1,5
"MULDER: If she'd lived, she'd be Lauren's age. (Scully looks at Mulder and he looks at her.)  ",1,5
MULDER: Not necessarily.  ,1,5
"MULDER: Do you know how difficult it is to fake your own death? Only one man has pulled it off, Elvis.  ",1,5
"MULDER: You may be right. (They get to the door to the office of Ellen Bledsoe, ME.)  ",1,5
"MULDER: Sure, all you got to do is prove that Howard Graves is still alive. (He knocks on the door.)  ",1,5
MULDER: I don't suppose you ran any dental conformation?  ,1,5
MULDER: Who made positive ID on the body? (Scully looks through the report again.)  ,1,5
MULDER: But Howard Graves was cremated. There would be no way to run a dental check or to get a DNA sample.  ,1,5
MULDER: Why?  ,1,5
"MULDER: Do you know who this is? (The man from the beginning, the non-talker at the morgue walks in)  ",1,5
MULDER: We were following leads pertaining to an X File.  ,1,5
MULDER: Then we have nothing more to talk about. (Mulder and Scully walk away. The woman and man follow them to the hallway.)  ,1,5
MULDER: How's Lauren Kyte involved?  ,1,5
MULDER: My advise to you. Don't get rough with her.  ,1,5
"MULDER: Ok, then you're free to go. (Lauren looks up surprised and gets up from her chair. Scully throws a surprised look in Mulder's direction as Lauren walks by her. Lauren pauses at the door.)  ",1,5
MULDER: Why? Because of Howard Graves?  ,1,5
"MULDER: I know. He's watching over you, isn't he?  ",1,5
MULDER: So now Howard is protecting you?  ,1,5
MULDER: What are you doing Scully? You don't believe.  ,1,5
MULDER: Well we may have just sacrificed our best opportunity to observe spectral phenomena.  ,1,5
"MULDER: We don't have him. He's not even breaking a sweat. (Dorland is standing in a corner with the employees, engaging in small talk. The man walks up to Mulder.)  ",1,5
"MULDER: Lauren, it's over. We have to go. (She looks around the room as Dorland enters.) What we're looking for isn't here. (Lauren takes a letter opener from the desk and smashes the glass in a picture frame and takes out the photo.)  ",1,5
"MULDER: Lauren, No! (Dorland pushes her away and he is pushed against the wall by Howard. The door slams shut. Dorland starts gasping at his neck. He can't breathe.  ",1,5
"MULDER: Get down. (Outside the office, Scully hears the commotion and runs back to Dorland's office door. It's locked.)  ",1,5
MULDER: I guess what we're looking for is here.  ,1,5
MULDER: Where are you going?  ,1,5
"MULDER: Boy, she's in a rush to get out of here.  ",1,5
"MULDER: Hey, Scully. Do you believe in the afterlife?  ",1,5
MULDER: Have you ever seen the liberty bell?  ,1,5
"MULDER: You know, I've been to Philadelphia a 100 times and I've never seen it.  ",1,5
"MULDER: Yeah, (Mulder starts the car and drives off) but I'd really like to go.  ",1,5
MULDER: I don't know. How late do you think they stay open?  ,1,5
MULDER: (hugging him) Jerry?  ,1,6
MULDER: Jerry and I worked together in Violent Crimes.  ,1,6
"MULDER: So, Jerry, what are you doing here?  ",1,6
"MULDER: Look, Jerry. I'd like to help you out, but we're not on general assignment.  ",1,6
MULDER: You won't drop the ball.  ,1,6
"MULDER: Yeah, but Jerry ...  ",1,6
MULDER: I'm a pain in the ass to work with.  ,1,6
MULDER: I'm not a pain in the ass? We had different career goals. Jerry wanted the fifth floor.  ,1,6
MULDER: I was gunning for a basement office with no heat or windows.  ,1,6
MULDER: He ran into a little bad luck in Atlanta working hate crimes.  ,1,6
"MULDER: He misplaced a piece of evidence, bagged and everything. Sent it to the cleaners. By the time he got it back, a federal judge had lost both his hands and his right eye.  ",1,6
MULDER: Uh-huh.  ,1,6
MULDER: How do you like that? A politically correct elevator.  ,1,6
MULDER: You okay?  ,1,6
"MULDER: The, uh, servo switch. Could it have been moved manually?  ",1,6
"MULDER: If somebody wanted to override the COS, what would they ...?  ",1,6
"MULDER: Well, we're going to need a list of all the people with that kind of know how.  ",1,6
MULDER: Would you be on it?  ,1,6
MULDER: What about the phone lines? Does the COS monitor all phone calls?  ,1,6
MULDER: I was just wondering.  ,1,6
MULDER: Phone's off the hook. (hangs it up) Maybe Drake was talking to someone right before he did his Ben Franklin impersonation.  ,1,6
MULDER: Come in.  ,1,6
MULDER: I'm just looking for my profile notes.  ,1,6
MULDER: They were right here. I'm telling you.  ,1,6
"MULDER: (whisper) Forget it, no.  ",1,6
"MULDER: Jerry, what the hell are you doing?  ",1,6
"MULDER: Jerry, that was my profile.  ",1,6
"MULDER: Jerry, you went into my office and you stole my work.  ",1,6
MULDER: He apologized - in his own way.  ,1,6
MULDER: One name? Brad Wilczek?  ,1,6
MULDER: That just seems too obvious. To kill Drake would be so brazenly egomaniacal.  ,1,6
MULDER: Fully. (as they exit)  ,1,6
MULDER: So this is what a 220 IQ and a $400 million severance settlement buys you.  ,1,6
"MULDER: That's from the Greek, isn't it? Um, ""I learn things.""  ",1,6
"MULDER: Mr. Wilczek, is this system related to the one in your corporate building?  ",1,6
"MULDER: In your opinion, how many people know the system well enough to override it?  ",1,6
MULDER: Could someone have hacked into the system?  ,1,6
MULDER: (to SCULLY) Will you give me a second? (SCULLY nods. MULDER steps outside the office with JERRY.)  ,1,6
MULDER: All you had to do was ask. I would've helped you with the profile.  ,1,6
MULDER: What *what's* like?  ,1,6
MULDER: Yea ...  ,1,6
MULDER: That was bad luck. That could have happened to anybody.  ,1,6
"MULDER: Don't run yourself down, Jerry. You're a good agent. We did some good work together.  ",1,6
MULDER: That's not how it was.  ,1,6
"MULDER: I'm saying that both voices are Brad Wilczek's. He may have disguised his voice electronically, but he couldn't alter the form that is unique to his own speech patterns.  ",1,6
MULDER: I'll go with you.  ,1,6
MULDER: All right.  ,1,6
MULDER: I don't think Wilczek did it.  ,1,6
MULDER: It doesn't make sense. Why would he go back to Eurisko?  ,1,6
"MULDER: If you were going to destroy evidence, would you pose for the cameras?  ",1,6
MULDER: I think Wilczek is smarter than this. (Turns on tape again.)  ,1,6
"MULDER: Yeah, I know. (Shows badge) I ordered the subpoena.  ",1,6
MULDER: What are you talking about?  ,1,6
MULDER: Thanks for coming.  ,1,6
MULDER: I need to know why Brad Wilczek is the subject of a code five investigation. What the Defense Department wants with him.  ,1,6
MULDER: Software.  ,1,6
MULDER: What kind of software?  ,1,6
MULDER: I thought it was only theoretical.  ,1,6
MULDER: An adaptive network?  ,1,6
MULDER: I want you to tell me why you're willing to spend the rest of your life in prison for a crime you didn't commit.  ,1,6
MULDER: I know you're innocent. You're protecting a machine -- the Central Operating System at Eurisko.  ,1,6
MULDER: Then what?  ,1,6
MULDER: Oppenheimer may have regretted his actions but he never denied responsibility for them.  ,1,6
MULDER: But your machine killed Drake. And it killed my friend.  ,1,6
MULDER: And you talk about morality. You're afraid of the government but you're willing to accept the risk that your machine will kill again.  ,1,6
MULDER: What about a third option. You created that machine. Now you tell me how to destroy it.  ,1,6
MULDER: Wilczek can create a virus that will destroy the system.  ,1,6
MULDER: But it's the only thing that makes sense. The COS project was posting big losses for Eurisko and Drake was about to terminate the program.  ,1,6
MULDER: Self-preservation. It's the primary instinct of all sentient beings.  ,1,6
MULDER: Then why was our government trying to usurp Wilczek's research?  ,1,6
MULDER: You're probably right. (Starts to leave.)  ,1,6
MULDER: To talk to someone. (SCULLY watches him leave)  ,1,6
MULDER: How much time do you need?  ,1,6
"MULDER: Scully, what are you doing here?  ",1,6
MULDER: It's the machine.  ,1,6
MULDER: You remember the Trojan Horse? (Reaches in trunk and pulls out VA license plate EURISKO)  ,1,6
"MULDER: (grinning) Open, Sesame! (SCULLY is not amused.)  ",1,6
"MULDER: Oh, what the - -  ",1,6
MULDER: So much for the element of surprise. What do you say we take the stairs? (Computer watches them cross the garage.)  ,1,6
"MULDER: 28 down, one to go. (Lights go out)  ",1,6
MULDER: Trick or treat.  ,1,6
MULDER: No! (stops her)  ,1,6
"MULDER: I don't want to make the same mistake Drake made. (Takes insulated screwdriver out of his bag. When he touches it to the lock, WHAMMMMO!!!! Huge flash, lots of sparks. SCULLY jumps back. Beeping sound starts. MULDER tries door. Still locked. He looks around and points at security camera.)  ",1,6
"MULDER: (to camera) What are you looking at? (Camera POV as MULDER puts glove over the lens. MULDER takes flashlight and looks around, then up at a ceiling vent. Then looks down at SCULLY.)  ",1,6
MULDER: There should be a way for you to drop down and open the door.  ,1,6
"MULDER: (waiting, to himself) Come on, Scully.  ",1,6
MULDER: Scully? (Door opens)  ,1,6
MULDER: Where's the B port?  ,1,6
MULDER: Damn.  ,1,6
MULDER: Now I can put in the virus.  ,1,6
MULDER: Defense Department?  ,1,6
MULDER: Don't listen to him.  ,1,6
"MULDER: The machine's a monster, Scully. It's already killed two people. They won't be able to handle it any better than Wilczek did.  ",1,6
MULDER: I checked with Congressman Klebanon and the Department of Corrections Subcommittee. I even petitioned the Attorney General's office.  ,1,6
MULDER: They can't just take a man like Brad Wilczek without an explanation.  ,1,6
MULDER: Where is he?  ,1,6
MULDER: Wilczek won't deal. He'll never work for them.  ,1,6
MULDER: What else could I have done?  ,1,6
MULDER: The Department of Defense still hasn't found anything?  ,1,6
MULDER: This team of scientists made up the Arctic Ice Core Project. They were sent to Alaska by the government's Advanced Research Project Agency nearly a year ago to drill into the arctic ice.  ,1,7
"MULDER: So far nobody's been able to reach to reach the compound because of bad weather. Obviously, they either think we're either brilliant or expendable because we've pulled the assignment.  ",1,7
"MULDER: These were top geophysicists. They were trained and screened for this project in every way imaginable, including psychological makeup. We leave for Nome today.  ",1,7
"MULDER: Fouts retired in '87, didn't he?  ",1,7
"MULDER: Agent Mulder and Agent Scully, you?  ",1,7
MULDER: San Diego? You get much of a chance to study ice down there?  ,1,7
"MULDER: Mulder, nice to meet you.  ",1,7
MULDER: Hi.  ,1,7
MULDER: What for?  ,1,7
MULDER: (Showing it to Hodge) It's me!  ,1,7
MULDER: (looking at DaSilva's ID) It's you.  ,1,7
MULDER: Something wrong?  ,1,7
MULDER: Yeah.  ,1,7
MULDER: Bear? See if you can get the power started.  ,1,7
"MULDER: Before we touch anything, we have to thoroughly document the scene.  ",1,7
MULDER: That's what they were drilling for. Quarter of a million years melting away in a couple of days.  ,1,7
MULDER: It's the generator.  ,1,7
"MULDER: Yeah, he didn't break the skin. Bear, you okay?  ",1,7
MULDER: What could that mean?  ,1,7
MULDER: Danny?  ,1,7
MULDER: My interpretation of satellite remote sensing photos is a little rusty.  ,1,7
"MULDER: I also found this data and if I'm reading it correctly, the team actually found the ice sheet to be twice that depth.  ",1,7
MULDER: What'd you find?  ,1,7
MULDER: Unless a foreign object was introduced into that environment.  ,1,7
MULDER: Holy... Scully.  ,1,7
MULDER: Unless that's how it lives.  ,1,7
"MULDER: If those bodies are infected with an unknown organism, we can't take them back. We can't go back without proper quarantine procedures. We can't risk bringing back the next plague.  ",1,7
MULDER: It didn't break the skin -  ,1,7
"MULDER: Okay, anyone got the morning sports section handy?  ",1,7
"MULDER: You can't go, the dog bit you.  ",1,7
MULDER: We have to. We can't risk infecting the population.  ,1,7
MULDER: Take a vote. Whoever believes we should confine Bear until he agrees to an examination?  ,1,7
"MULDER: Murphy, get a rope!  ",1,7
MULDER: We don't know enough about it!  ,1,7
"MULDER: This is the A.I.C.P. Investigative Team calling Doolittle Airfield, come in.  ",1,7
"MULDER: This is Agent Mulder, we have a serious biological hazard. Request air pick-up and quarantine procedures, over.  ",1,7
"MULDER: We were told we would have three clear days of weather, over.  ",1,7
"MULDER: Is Bear in any condition to fly? We don't get out in an hour, we don't get out for days.  ",1,7
MULDER: Have you figured out how it's transmitted yet?  ,1,7
MULDER: Were they all in the spine?  ,1,7
"MULDER: You're saying it's possible that the worm makes you want to kill other people, which is maybe what happened to the first team.  ",1,7
MULDER: Maybe they did it to save us.  ,1,7
"MULDER: Just some sleep, huh?  ",1,7
"MULDER: We're all wired and hypersensitive, it'll be good to get a fresh start in the morning.  ",1,7
MULDER: I don't know if we should kill it.  ,1,7
MULDER: The meteor that crashed here a quarter of a million years ago may have carried that type of life to earth.  ,1,7
MULDER: Exactly. But what do we know about it? This organism might be lying dormant in another crater.  ,1,7
"MULDER: But if we do kill it now, we may never know how to stop it or anything like it in the future.  ",1,7
MULDER: Do we have the right to destroy an organism which can provide... (trails off)  ,1,7
MULDER: How do you know it can't be contained?  ,1,7
"MULDER: Let's all just settle down, it's been a long hard day. We're all tired and scared. Let's not all turn on one another.  ",1,7
MULDER: Maybe we should all get some sleep.  ,1,7
"MULDER: Before anyone passes judgement, may I remind you we are in the Arctic.  ",1,7
"MULDER: Good night, Scully.  ",1,7
"MULDER: Don't forget, the spots on the dog went away.  ",1,7
MULDER: Murphy's dead.  ,1,7
"MULDER: I found him like this. I heard one of the doors close, I came out to check it out. It's one of you.  ",1,7
MULDER: I don't have any of the symptoms.  ,1,7
MULDER: It was one of you!  ,1,7
"MULDER: What, so he can doctor the results? I'm not gonna let him stick a needle in me! He could be infected!  ",1,7
"MULDER: I'm not turning my back on anyone! As far as I'm concerned, you're all infected!  ",1,7
"MULDER: Scully, get that gun off me!  ",1,7
MULDER: Put it down!  ,1,7
"MULDER: Scully! For God sakes, it's me!  ",1,7
"MULDER: In here, I'll be safer than you.  ",1,7
MULDER: It's just you?  ,1,7
MULDER: It's one of them.  ,1,7
MULDER: So?  ,1,7
"MULDER: You give me one worm, you'll infect me.  ",1,7
MULDER: (whispering) I would have but you pulled a gun on me. Now I don't trust them. I wanted to trust you.  ,1,7
MULDER: So is she.  ,1,7
MULDER: Bastards! No!  ,1,7
MULDER: Scully!  ,1,7
MULDER: Do it!  ,1,7
"MULDER: I'm going back to the site. This time, I'm going fully prepared with proper equipment. There's still a lot of research to be done on it's genetic structure, on it's origin...  ",1,7
MULDER: Know what?  ,1,7
"MULDER: It's still there, Scully. 200,000 years down in the ice.  ",1,7
MULDER: Just that they worked for NASA. (Hands over note.)  They wanted to talk to somebody from the FBI.  ,1,8
MULDER: I have no idea.  ,1,8
MULDER: 	It's beginning to look that way. ,1,8
MULDER:	 Fox Mulder...  ,1,8
MULDER:	In what capacity?  ,1,8
MULDER:	Do you have evidence of sabotage?  ,1,8
MULDER: Evidence of tampering?  ,1,8
MULDER:	Does anybody share your suspicions?  ,1,8
"MULDER: Well, if you were a terrorist, there probably isn't a more potent symbol of American progress and prosperity.  And if you're an opponent of big science, NASA itself represents a vast money trench that exists outside the crucible and debate of the democratic process.  And of course there are those futurists who believe the Space Shuttle is a rusty old bucket that should be mothballed.  A dinosaur spacecraft built in the 70's by scientists setting their sights on space in an ever declining scale.  ",1,8
MULDER: 	Not to mention certain fringe elements who accuse our government itself of space sabotage.  The failure of the Hubble Telescope and the Mars Observer are directly connected to a conspiracy to deny us evidence.  ,1,8
MULDER: 	Alien civilizations.  ,1,8
"MULDER: Wow, look at that  Gemini 8.  ",1,8
"MULDER: 	Well, the man we're gonna see?  Col Marcus Aurelius Belt nearly died on that mission.  Had to make an emergency landing right in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.  ",1,8
"MULDER: You never wanted to be an astronaut when you were a kid, Scully?  ",1,8
MULDER: 	Col. Belt.  Fox Mulder. (Extends hand)  I'm a big fan.  It's an honor to meet you.  Y-you were a big hero to me when I was a kid.  ,1,8
MULDER: 	I-I stayed up all night when I was 14 to watch your space walk.  ,1,8
"MULDER: (grinning, as they rise)  Do you think there would be a problem with us watching lift off from Mission Control?  ",1,8
"MULDER: (Shaking hands again, still in awe)  It was an honor, sir.  ",1,8
MULDER: You didn't order the analysis?  ,1,8
MULDER: But as a matter of course wouldn't you order a material analysis if a part malfunctioned?  ,1,8
MULDER AND SCULLY: Thank you.  (They start up stairs to balcony)  ,1,8
MULDER: 	I can't believe how much faith we put in machines.  ,1,8
MULDER: I can't believe that Col Belt would endanger the lives of those astronauts knowing that something might go wrong.  He was an astronaut himself.  ,1,8
"MULDER: God, I hope so. ",1,8
"MULDER: 	I have to admit, that fulfilled one of my boyhood fantasies.  ",1,8
"MULDER: Come on, Scully.  You have to admit that was exciting.  Mission control....(playfully punches her arm)....countdown.  ",1,8
MULDER: What happened?  ,1,8
"MULDER: They have a press blackout in effect.  Chances are, the media doesn't know about it.  ",1,8
MULDER: 	I don't know.  Things go wrong all the time.  ,1,8
MULDER: Usually.  ,1,8
MULDER: Michelle!  I can see her.  ,1,8
MULDER: Kneeling at passenger side of overturned car)  You all right?  ,1,8
MULDER: You all right?  ,1,8
MULDER: C'mere.  Can you push with your legs?  ,1,8
"MULDER: Okay, all right.  Come on.  Okay.  Come on  Okay.   (Pulls Michelle out)  ",1,8
MULDER: What happened?  ,1,8
MULDER:	(explaining to Scully for our benefit)  The Orbiter maneuvering system has malfunctioned.  Without it they can't rotate the shuttle.  They need to rotate it away from the sun to keep the Orbiter cool.  ,1,8
MULDER: Where's Col. Belt?  ,1,8
MULDER: Where's that?  ,1,8
MULDER: I'm a federal agent.  Come on out of there.  (Scully and Michelle join Mulder. Computer Tech Geek with Glasses comes out of the corner)  What are you doing in here?  ,1,8
"MULDER: Did you see anybody else in here? (CTGG shakes his head, lights come back on) Okay, call security.  I want a search of the premises.  I don't want anybody coming in or out of this building who doesn't have proper clearance.  ",1,8
MULDER: 	(Explaining to Scully)  They're cutting off ground control to the Orbiter. The astronauts will be flying the shuttle all by themselves.  ,1,8
MULDER: They cut off contact with the shuttle.  (Everyone waits.  Very tense)  ,1,8
MULDER: Col. Belt?   Col. Belt?  Can I talk to you for a moment?  ,1,8
"MULDER: You've got no argument from me, sir.  You're true American heroes.  ",1,8
"MULDER: 	Sir, I have to ask.  I'm sorry, it's my job.  Do you think someone is sabotaging the shuttle?  ",1,8
MULDER: (To Scully) That's the liquid O2 leaking out into space.  The exact same thing happened to Col. Belt on an Apollo mission.  ,1,8
MULDER: We'll find Col. Belt.  ,1,8
MULDER: She doesn't know how serious the leak is.  ,1,8
MULDER: Col. Belt's been up there in the same situation before.  He'll know better than anybody else what to do.  He's got to make the decisions.  ,1,8
MULDER: Col. Belt?  Col. Belt!  ,1,8
MULDER: Col. Belt.  Are you all right?  ,1,8
"MULDER: They need you down at Mission Control, sir.  There's been another accident.  ",1,8
MULDER: You don't know that.  ,1,8
MULDER: He saved their lives earlier.  ,1,8
MULDER: And you think killing those astronauts isn't going to have the same effect?  ,1,8
MULDER: He doesn't want those men to die.  ,1,8
MULDER: I know it.  I'm sure of it.  ,1,8
MULDER: And he may be the only person who can get them down alive.  Now how can you be certain that what he's doing isn't the right thing?  That what he's doing isn't going to save their lives?  Now I need access to you records... in a hurry. (Michelle leads them off)  ,1,8
"MULDER: (at computer with Computer Tech Geek with Glasses)  I need everything on the Hubble Telescope,  the Mars Observer, the Shuttle Challenger, and the current Orbiter mission.  ",1,8
"MULDER: X-rays, diagrams, schematics - - any proof that Belt knew about a sabotage.  ",1,8
"MULDER: This is from the Challenger.  It's the O ring fitting that failed dated January 21, 1986.  That's one week before the space shuttle blew up.  And the analysis was ordered by Col. Belt.  ",1,8
"MULDER: Something weird is going on here, Scully.  ",1,8
MULDER: Where is he?  ,1,8
MULDER: Get a doctor.  ,1,8
"MULDER: How can we help you, Col.?  ",1,8
MULDER: Strap him down.  ,1,8
MULDER: No.  ,1,8
MULDER: He's trying to tell us something. Col. Belt.  ,1,8
"MULDER: (Holding up his finger) Col. Belt, I want you to focus.  Focus your breathing. Focus your pain. (Oh, this scene is bad)  Right here.  ",1,8
MULDER: Focus.  (Belt calms) Now you're focused. Right here.  Now you're going to save those astronauts and you're going to tell me how to do it.  ,1,8
MULDER: How do you know it can't survive?  ,1,8
MULDER: How has it been damaged?  ,1,8
MULDER: Did you sabotage the shuttle?  ,1,8
MULDER: Stop who?  ,1,8
MULDER: Stop who?  ,1,8
MULDER: Who?  ,1,8
MULDER:	They're bringing the shuttle down.  You said the shuttle would burn up on reentry.  Is there anything we can do to save it?  ,1,8
MULDER: Change the trajectory to what?  ,1,8
MULDER: (running in) You've to change the reentry trajectory.  ,1,8
MULDER: You've got to change it to 35 degrees.  ,1,8
MULDER: Col. Belt- - -  ,1,8
MULDER: It's your only shot.  ,1,8
MULDER: Something had possessed him.  Something he must have seen out there in space.  ,1,8
MULDER: I don't think he ever really knew exactly how it was working through him or that he ever knew...that he was...responsible for his own actions.  ,1,8
"MULDER: You saw what I saw, Scully.  I think he was trying to warn her.  I think that he sent Michelle those x-rays like he was trying to reach out to her without quite knowing why, as if...his own instinctual impulse was to save those men.  ",1,8
"MULDER: Hey, Scully, we send those men up into space to unlock the doors of the universe, and we don't even know what's behind them.  I think what ever it was, he took it with him.  And in the end that was the only way he knew how to stop it.  ",1,8
"MULDER: He gave his own life.  As an astronaut, that was something he was prepared to do.  ",1,8
MULDER: Then what happened out there if it wasn't a train wreck? ,1,9
MULDER: Reclamations? ,1,9
MULDER: He's part of a craft retrieval unit. ,1,9
MULDER: I think you knocked out a filling. ,1,9
MULDER: Since when does taking pictures put anyone's life at risk? ,1,9
MULDER: That's a quarantine? Is that what you call this? ,1,9
MULDER: Thats a lot of firepower just to protect mother nature. ,1,9
"MULDER: You've got a downed craft in those woods, sir. And troops carrying live rounds ! We both know what's out there!    ",1,9
MULDER: Go ahead. ,1,9
MULDER: What makes you so sure that something's out there? ,1,9
MULDER: I didn't order room service. ,1,9
MULDER: Did you meet Max? ,1,9
"MULDER: Max from NICAP. (Looks to empty bunk) Oh, they must have released him. Another intrepid soul in seach of a close enounter. ",1,9
MULDER: What else? ,1,9
MULDER: So what else is new? ,1,9
MULDER: Because I know what I saw Scully. There weren't train tracks anywhere near that site. So how could it have been a derailed container? ,1,9
MULDER: OK. I'm all ears. What was it? ,1,9
MULDER: You really believe that story..? ,1,9
MULDER: A highly classified lie. (Helicopter passes overhead) They're searching for someone Scully. ,1,9
"MULDER: You think they'd roll out all of this material for one Libyan fighter jock? (pause) Besides, no human pilot walked away from the wreckage I saw. ",1,9
MULDER: Maybe.    ,1,9
MULDER and SCULLY walk from car to motel door.  ,1,9
"MULDER: As long as we're here in beuartiful downtown Townsend, why not? ",1,9
MULDER: That gives us 24 hours to investigate. ,1,9
"MULDER: ""The Last Detail"" starring Dana Scully  ",1,9
MULDER: Looks like housekeeping hasn't been here yet. ,1,9
MULDER: SH...  ,1,9
MULDER: Max? ,1,9
MULDER: Max? ,1,9
MULDER: Know what? ,1,9
MULDER: But you don't know me. Last night is the first time you've laid eyes on me. ,1,9
MULDER: Following my career? How? ,1,9
MULDER: How did you recognize me? ,1,9
MULDER: I published that under a pseudonym. ,1,9
MULDER: I didn't think anyone was really paying attention ,1,9
MULDER: (looking at Scully) *Enigmatic* Dr. Scully.    ,1,9
MULDER: Fraud. ,1,9
MULDER: Some unreported weathering effects common to wheat or a systematic reaction to the plant tissue to being lodged in one position.  ,1,9
MULDER: I try to keep up. ,1,9
MULDER: Max! You said you had something to show us. ,1,9
MULDER: What have you got Max? ,1,9
MULDER: Mrs. Wright? Hi. I'm Fox Mulder. This is Dana Scully. We're from the FBI. We'd like to ask you a few questions about your husband. ,1,9
MULDER: Why won't you let us help you? ,1,9
"MULDER: What about his wife and child, Doctor? Would you have anything to say to them? Because whoever got to you also got to her. They must have some pretty big threats. What did they hold over your head? Your medical licence, the IRS? ",1,9
MULDER: Excuse me? ,1,9
"MULDER: Dr. Oppenheim. Tell us about the deputy. You saw him that night, didn't you? ",1,9
"MULDER: Doctor, in your opinion, could those burns have been caused by ionizing radiation? ",1,9
"MULDER: I've read about these kinds of burns, Scully. ",1,9
MULDER: I'm talking about close encounter mortalities. I have a stack of X-files recording the same clinical results. ,1,9
MULDER: (to HENDERSON) Tell us what happened out there? ,1,9
MULDER: Wrong colonel. We both want the same thing. Only you want it dead. Can't you see that chasing it down like an animal you leave it no choice but to defend itself? How many more people have to die before you rethink your approach?  ,1,9
"MULDER: Max? (knocking) Hey, Max. Max?  ",1,9
MULDER: Hey... Max ,1,9
MULDER: Max.. Its me. Fox Mulder.. Are you OK? ,1,9
MULDER: You were haveing some kind of seizure. ,1,9
MULDER: You were lying on the floor. Unconscious. Convulsing. ,1,9
MULDER: Lets get you to the hospital. ,1,9
MULDER: Are you sure? ,1,9
"MULDER: And when you have a seizure, you have no memory of it? ",1,9
"MULDER: Rough night, huh? ",1,9
"MULDER: So what do you think, Scully? What's going on out there? ",1,9
MULDER: I want you to take a look at something first. ,1,9
MULDER: Max. There's an unsual incision bechind his left ear. I've seen this incision twice before. Two women. A thousand miles apart. No way of knowing each other. No relation. Both claim to have been abducted by aliens. ,1,9
MULDER: They're for his epilepsy. ,1,9
"MULDER: You don't seem to understand Scully. Max doesn't believe he was abducted by aliens, I believe he was. Now could you at least take a look at the scar, and give me you medical opinion? ",1,9
"MULDER: (Knocking on trailer) Hey, Max. (opens trailer) Max!  ",1,9
MULDER: Max? ,1,9
"MULDER: What is that, blood?  ",1,9
MULDER: Come on.(Heading towards the car) ,1,9
"MULDER: Think about is Scully. Max is a gypsy. A nomad, right? ",1,9
"MULDER: So he intercepted Deputy Wright's last call to his dispatcher. Which means he was here in Townsend Wisconsin the night of the crash. Of all the places he could of been, he was right here. Don't you think thats more than a coincidence. If Max was abducted that would go a long way to explaining his obsession. And if we've figured it out, you can be sure Col. Henderson has as well. Do you have the keys? (SCULLY hands over keys.)    ",1,9
MULDER: Max? ,1,9
MULDER: Max. Its alright. ,1,9
"MULDER: Come on. Come on, Max. ",1,9
MULDER: I'm hear to help you. ,1,9
MULDER: I know. ,1,9
"MULDER: I won't let them take you. Come on, Max. Come with me. ",1,9
MULDER: Max! Max!(Mulder limps off in another direction) MAX!  ,1,9
MULDER: He's gone. They got to him first. They beat us Colonel. ,1,9
"MULDER: Do you hear that sound Scully? (picks up crutches) Hammer and nails. They're building a gallows in the town square. Don't worry. (Scully bends down, picking up a large envelope) It was only a matter of time. (Hands envelope to Mulder) I'm surprised I lasted this long. ",1,9
MULDER: (limping on crutches) I'll break a leg.  ,1,9
MULDER: Over a dozen men lost their lives and you want me to respond to issues of protocol? ,1,9
MULDER: Because I knew it wouldn't be forthcoming. ,1,9
MULDER: (Raising his voice) A cover up was underway... ,1,9
"MULDER: (Yelling) Oh, toxic contamination? Are we back in that? You read my report, explain the disapearance of Max Fenig. ",1,9
MULDER: I have further evidence to support my conclusions -- X-rays taken while Mr. Fenig was institutionalized show an object lodged in his cerrebelum (Waves the envelope) ,1,9
MULDER: The man was abducted. We all know it. Everybody in this room knows it. ,1,9
MULDER: Then what can I say? (Stands up) How can I disprove lies that are stamped with an official seal? ,1,9
"MULDER: You can deny all the things I've seen. All the things I've discovered. But not for much longer. Because too many others know what's happening out there. And no one. No government agency has jurisdiction over the truth. (Takes crutches and envelope, and leaves)    ",1,9
MULDER: I'd say the man was running on empty.  ,1,10
MULDER: Any evidence would have be washed away by yesterday's rain.  ,1,10
MULDER: Are you at all familiar with the phenomena of cattle mutilations?  ,1,10
"MULDER: Since 1967, over 34 states have reported unsolved cases of cattle mutilations. Trace evidence is remarkably similar. Incision marks of surgical precision. The area around the mouth and often the sexual organs have been removed. There's a substantial degree of blood loss but not a trace of blood at the scene.  ",1,10
"MULDER: Exsanguination. If you were to stick a needle into the jugular of any living creature, the heart itself would act as a pump. These animals have had their jugulars punctured the same as the man in Greenwich, CT. Although this is the first time I've ever seen it on a human being.  ",1,10
"MULDER: The ME found traces of digitalis, a South American plant that can be used as a paralytic drug.  ",1,10
MULDER: Witnesses often relate time loss. We've seen this in abduction cases. That might explain why the girl can't remember anything.  ,1,10
"MULDER: For the same reason we cut up frogs and monkeys. Besides, they seem to have stepped up their interest.  ",1,10
MULDER: Has she spoken about it?  ,1,10
MULDER: Any nightmares?  ,1,10
"MULDER: Nice bunny, Teena. Can we talk about what happened that day? About what happened in the back yard?  ",1,10
MULDER: Yeah? Do you remember... any strange sounds or lights or anything like that?  ,1,10
MULDER: Can you tell me more about the Red Lightening?  ,1,10
MULDER: Had you ever seen anything like that before?  ,1,10
MULDER: Yeah? When?  ,1,10
MULDER: Why were these men after your Dad?  ,1,10
MULDER: It's like looking at a mirror image.  ,1,10
MULDER: Puncture wounds?  ,1,10
MULDER: That's Pacific standard time. That makes it the exact same moment.  ,1,10
"MULDER: No. Serial killers seldom work in pairs. And when they do, they kill together not separately.  ",1,10
MULDER: Is Reardon's daughter nearby when he was murdered?  ,1,10
MULDER: When will they be back?  ,1,10
MULDER: Even money... she'll remember Red Lightening.  ,1,10
"MULDER: Someone or something, Scully.  ",1,10
MULDER: Maybe they weren't looking in the right direction. (He points up.)  ,1,10
"MULDER: You live here, Cindy?  ",1,10
"MULDER: Cindy really is a beautiful little girl, Mrs. Reardon.  ",1,10
MULDER: Is she an only child?  ,1,10
MULDER: Was she the only child delivered at that birth?  ,1,10
"MULDER: Mrs. Reardon, have you ever seen this man before?  ",1,10
MULDER: No.  ,1,10
MULDER: No... he... he did... he didn't...  ,1,10
MULDER: In vitro fertilization?  ,1,10
MULDER: At which clinic?  ,1,10
MULDER: Thanks.  ,1,10
MULDER: I don't know. The only thing similar about these girls doesn't seem to be their appearance.  ,1,10
MULDER: Who both just happened to see their father's exsanguinated. I'd like to get the odds on that in Vegas.  ,1,10
MULDER: One girl was just abducted.  ,1,10
"MULDER: Potato, potahto.  ",1,10
MULDER: The murders were committed by the same person or persons. Part of the pattern involves kidnaping the daughter.  ,1,10
MULDER: I'm going to keep an eye on the girl. You check out the clinic. See if the Simmons were enrolled in the same fertility program.  ,1,10
MULDER: Okay.  ,1,10
MULDER: Maybe now she's trying to erase the results?  ,1,10
MULDER: So you think this is a vendetta that she and a colleague have against the Stapes Center?  ,1,10
MULDER: I'll tell you what... I'm going to sleep on it and we'll talk about it in the morning.  ,1,10
"MULDER: No, I'm not.  ",1,10
MULDER: What's a girl?  ,1,10
"MULDER: No, I have... there's a movie I want to watch on TV. Sleep tight. See you in the morning.   ",1,10
MULDER: Yes. What are you doing here?  ,1,10
MULDER: No you haven't.  ,1,10
MULDER VOICE OVER: The Lichfield Experiment.  ,1,10
MULDER: Agents Mulder and Scully. We're here to see Eve 6.  ,1,10
MULDER: What are those?  ,1,10
MULDER: Hello?  (They see Eve 6 crouching in the corner on the floor with shackles. Eve 6 has dirty hair and yellow teeth. There are pictures on the wall.)  ,1,10
MULDER: They're probably there for a good reason.  ,1,10
MULDER: Where are the others? The other Adams and the Eves?  ,1,10
MULDER: Heightened psychosis.  ,1,10
MULDER: Dr. Kendrick was using the clinic to carry on the Lichfield Experiment. She was cloning herself.   ,1,10
MULDER: Suppose Eve 6 is right and there are two other Eves out there. That could account for the two identical murders occurring at exactly the same time. Sally Kendrick does have an accomplice. Herself.  ,1,10
"MULDER: No. No, no, no. It seems the two remaining Eves are doing away with the parents in order to keep Teena and Cindy in the family.  ",1,10
MULDER: I hope not.  ,1,10
MULDER: I'll take the back.  ,1,10
MULDER: FBI. I'm armed.  ,1,10
MULDER: Which one are you? Eve 7 or Eve 8?  ,1,10
"MULDER: Mrs. Reardon, the fact that Kendrick and her accomplice murdered the fathers and abducted the girls means they want them alive. I'm sure Cindy's alive and we'll find her.  ",1,10
MULDER: That was a motel manager in Port Reyes that says he's got a guest that matches Sally Kendrick's description.  ,1,10
"MULDER: She might have ditched it. The manager said this woman checked in with a little girl. That she leaves the hotel in the afternoon by herself, was gone all night and returns the next day with the little girl.  ",1,10
"MULDER: No, he remembers this kid. She told him he should use chlorine to irradiate the dinoflagellates in the swimming pool. Does that sound like someone we know?  ",1,10
MULDER: What did the other lady look like?  ,1,10
MULDER: Eve 8. They were working together.  ,1,10
MULDER: Their own mini Jonestown. Eve 6 said they were prone to suicide.  ,1,10
"MULDER: Ah, maybe it would be better if we took responsibility for the girls.  ",1,10
MULDER: Yeah.  ,1,10
MULDER: Can you hold it?  ,1,10
MULDER: Hi. Where's your bathrooms?  ,1,10
MULDER: Thanks.  ,1,10
"MULDER: Oh, can I get four diet sodas?  ",1,10
"MULDER: Okay, two diet and two regular. To go. Please.  ",1,10
MULDER: Those are the diet?  ,1,10
MULDER: Are you sure? These are really sweet.  ,1,10
MULDER: Okay.  ,1,10
MULDER: Come on.  ,1,10
MULDER: How much?  ,1,10
MULDER: You want to pay?  ,1,10
MULDER: Thanks.  ,1,10
"MULDER: You didn't pick up my keys off the counter, did you?  ",1,10
MULDER: All right. I'll be right back.  ,1,10
MULDER: SCULLY!  ,1,10
MULDER: I just wanted to open the car door for you.  ,1,10
"MULDER (to Scully, quietly so the girls won't hear): It's them, they poisoned them, let's just get them into the car.  ",1,10
MULDER: I only had a sip.  ,1,10
MULDER: SCULLY! I GOT THEM!  ,1,10
MULDER: SCULLY!  ,1,10
MULDER: Back off. We're federal agents.  ,1,10
MULDER: Forget your sodas?  ,1,10
MULDER: That's the last thing you are.  ,1,10
"MULDER: They can't hide behind the bureaucracy, Mrs. Reardon. You have every right to know what happened. You have a right to know about your daughter.  ",1,10
"MULDER: Well, that's one of the luxuries of hunting down aliens and genetic mutants. You rarely get to press charges.  ",1,11
MULDER: What?  ,1,11
MULDER: That's weird. I'm sure I locked it.  ,1,11
MULDER: I told you I locked the door.  ,1,11
"MULDER: Ten-to-one, you can't dance to it.  ",1,11
MULDER: (to Scully) It's an old friend.  ,1,11
MULDER: For what?  ,1,11
MULDER: I'll try to remember that.  ,1,11
"MULDER: No, actually. It's one of the few things you didn't drive a stake through.  ",1,11
"MULDER: Dana Scully, this is Phoebe Green, terror of Scotland Yard.  ",1,11
MULDER: What brings you to the colonies?  ,1,11
MULDER: Your car bomber?  ,1,11
MULDER: The Irish Republican Army?  ,1,11
MULDER: You think he's that determined?  ,1,11
"MULDER: So what brings you on this detour to Washington, D.C., Inspector?  ",1,11
MULDER: I'll run it by our arson specialist.  ,1,11
"MULDER: That's, uh, from Sherlock Holmes. It's a private joke.  ",1,11
"MULDER: Um... we knew each other in school in England. She was brilliant and, uh, I got in over my head and, uh, paid the price.  ",1,11
"MULDER: That was over ten years ago, Scully.  ",1,11
"MULDER: Oh, I was merely extending her a professional courtesy.  ",1,11
"MULDER: Look, I'm going to run this by the arson guys and then she's on her own.  ",1,11
MULDER: How's that?  ,1,11
"MULDER: But there have been cases of pyrokinetics, people who can control and conduct fire.  ",1,11
"MULDER: I'm afraid so, Watson. But you're off the hook on this one.  ",1,11
MULDER: I mean I'm not going to put you through this.  ,1,11
MULDER: Phoebe's little mindgame.  ,1,11
"MULDER: There's something else I haven't told you about myself, Scully.  ",1,11
"MULDER: This is classic Phoebe Green. Mindgame player extraordinaire. Ten years it's taken me to forget about this woman, and she shows up in my life with a case like this.  ",1,11
MULDER: Phoebe is fire.  ,1,11
"MULDER: Sooner or later, a man's got to face his demons.  ",1,11
MULDER: I pulled this report off the wire last night. Eyewitnesses are saying that a customer in the bar caught fire but they're still looking for a body.  ,1,11
"MULDER: The bar's across the street from the fire station. It burned to the ground before they had a chance to even respond. The fire marshall said it burned so hot, it turned the concrete foundation into sponge cake. This was a woman who was in the bar.  ",1,11
MULDER: Miss Kotchek?  ,1,11
MULDER: I'm Special Agent Mulder from the F.B.I. This is Inspector Green.  ,1,11
"MULDER: Long hair, short hair?  ",1,11
MULDER: Do you think you could work with a composite artist and come up with a sketch for us?  ,1,11
MULDER: Can I get your full name and address?  ,1,11
"MULDER: That's no problem. You can come down to the field office and work with somebody there. I'll give you a minute to think about it, okay?  ",1,11
MULDER: It's a technique I refined in my relationship with you.  ,1,11
"MULDER: I'm sorry, that was a cheap shot. I don't want to dredge up the past. Let's just stick to the case.  ",1,11
"MULDER: Look, Phoebe, I...  ",1,11
MULDER: I'm cursed with a photographic memory.  ,1,11
"MULDER: Like I said, just stick to the case.  ",1,11
MULDER: I would agree with you but they haven't found a body yet.  ,1,11
"MULDER: Remember those reports I told you about, about people who could control and conduct fire, pyrokinetic?  ",1,11
MULDER: I think this guy just sent us a message that he's far more exotic.  ,1,11
MULDER: I'm just not used to someone so quick to agree with me.  ,1,11
MULDER: What kind of protection does the family have?  ,1,11
"MULDER: Well, he should look into getting a few additional men and limit public exposure.  ",1,11
MULDER: Unless you wanted to set a trap.  ,1,11
MULDER: Thanks.  ,1,11
MULDER: Mulder.  ,1,11
MULDER: I'm in Boston.  ,1,11
MULDER: What have you got?  ,1,11
"MULDER: Yeah, yeah...  ",1,11
"MULDER: No, it's just that I'm, I'm kind of anticipating having my hands full.  ",1,11
"MULDER: Good food, witty conversation. I'm having the time of my life.  ",1,11
MULDER: It doesn't look like your arsonist is going to make an appearance.  ,1,11
MULDER: What?  ,1,11
MULDER: Where's Phoebe?  ,1,11
MULDER: How about the kids?  ,1,11
"MULDER: I panicked. I couldn't move, Scully.  ",1,11
"MULDER: Yeah, but it happened to me. I hared out. Plain and simple.  ",1,11
MULDER: Hey.  ,1,11
MULDER: How are the kids?  ,1,11
MULDER: To the cape?  ,1,11
MULDER: And you?  ,1,11
MULDER: Right.  ,1,11
MULDER: Yeah.  ,1,11
MULDER: Yeah.  ,1,11
MULDER: And?  ,1,11
MULDER: What did you find on him?  ,1,11
MULDER: So he's clean.  ,1,11
MULDER: Where else did you find him?  ,1,11
MULDER: Call the local field office in Boston of the F.B.I. and get them to fax to you the composite that the witness did of the man who burned down the bar and then get them to fax it to every local law enforcement agency in the area.  ,1,11
"MULDER: I'm going to try and catch Phoebe, this guy could be waiting for them in Cape Cod.  ",1,11
MULDER: His name is Cecil L'Ively.  ,1,11
MULDER: Your arsonist. Where's the rest of the family?  ,1,11
"MULDER: Well, go find them. We've got to get them packed and get them out of here.  ",1,11
MULDER: I know. He disappeared.  ,1,11
"MULDER: Nothing, um... I found this out in the garage.  ",1,11
MULDER: Michael? Jimmie?  ,1,11
MULDER: Everybody out!  ,1,11
MULDER: I think he rigged the whole house.  ,1,11
MULDER: It's fuel.  ,1,11
"MULDER: Scully, see if you can find a fire extinguisher. Everybody else, outside.  ",1,11
MULDER: I'll take care of the children. Go!  ,1,11
MULDER: Oh yeah. I'll be fine. There's no place I'd rather be.  ,1,11
MULDER: Michael? Jimmie?  ,1,11
MULDER: Don't move!  ,1,11
MULDER: You have no idea.  ,1,11
MULDER: I don't know.  ,1,11
MULDER: No. She did messenger this to me last night though.  ,1,11
MULDER: No.  ,1,11
"MULDER: Ten-to-one, you can't dance to it.  ",1,11
"MULDER: I didn't think you'd be in today. How are you, Dana?  ",1,12
"MULDER: Two days ago, a couple was kidnapped at Jackson University. Elizabeth Hawley and James Summers, both 19.  ",1,12
"MULDER: No arrests were ever made. Police believed it to be a one-time offender but now it appears to be a serial incident. Anyway, if he holds true to form, we have five days to find those kids.  ",1,12
"MULDER: Well, here's another grim deadline.  ",1,12
MULDER: He claims to have information relating to the kidnapping. He described Hawley's bracelet down to the last detail. This is information that only family members could have known.  ,1,12
MULDER: Boggs feels that if his talents help save these kids then his sentence should be reduced to life in prison.  ,1,12
MULDER: He claims to have obtained this information through psychic transmission.  ,1,12
MULDER: Perhaps.  ,1,12
"MULDER: At the age of six, Luther Boggs slaughtered every pet animal in his housing project. When he was thirty, he strangled five family members over Thanksgiving dinner and then sat down to watch the fourth quarter of the Detroit - Green Bay game. Some killers are projects of society. Some act out past abuses. Boggs kills because he likes it.  ",1,12
"MULDER: Actually, he's requested to speak to me.  ",1,12
"MULDER: He read my profile on him and he believes I'm the only one who truly understands what he is. Anyway, I leave for Raleigh this afternoon.  ",1,12
MULDER: I think you should take some time.  ,1,12
MULDER: I'm sorry about your father.  ,1,12
MULDER: We? You mean the souls of your victims?  ,1,12
MULDER: And you're the conduit?  ,1,12
MULDER: From here? Where exactly are you?  ,1,12
MULDER: That's exactly what the state of North Carolina intends to do next week.  ,1,12
MULDER: First you've got to prove you're telling the truth.  ,1,12
MULDER: I tore this off my New York Knicks t-shirt. It has nothing to do with the crime.  ,1,12
"MULDER: Scully, what's wrong? Did Boggs say something to you?  ",1,12
"MULDER: It's alright. Why don't you go back to the motel? We've exposed Boggs as a fraud. Boggs is not what he claims to be. He may be orchestrating the kidnapping. Now he knows that we're on to him, he doesn't have a chance with this charade. I'm going to wait around a couple of hours and try to interrogate him. Hopefully, he'll tell me where the kids are.  ",1,12
MULDER: It's Mulder.  ,1,12
"MULDER: No, no, just five hours of Boggs' channeling. After three hours, I asked him to summon up the soul of Jimi Hendrix and requested ""All Along the Watchtower."" You know the guy's been dead for twenty years and he still hasn't lost his edge.  ",1,12
MULDER: Then how did you find it?  ,1,12
"MULDER: Scully, I told you about Boggs...  ",1,12
MULDER: That doesn't matter! That's exactly what Boggs wanted! He could have been setting you up! You could be dead right now! Why did you lie in your police report?  ,1,12
"MULDER: What you're really saying is that you didn't want to go on record admitting that you believed in Boggs! The bureau would expect something like that from ""Spooky"" Mulder, but not Dana Scully.  ",1,12
"MULDER: Why now? After all we've seen, why Boggs?  ",1,12
MULDER: You love your father.  ,1,12
"MULDER: Scully, look at this.  ",1,12
MULDER: That's exactly what I want Boggs to think.  ,1,12
"MULDER: They haven't been found, the article is bogus. The Carolinian made this one up just for us, only six people know about it. Later on today, Boggs gets his weekly phone priviliges. Hopefully, he'll call his accomplice to find out what happened.  ",1,12
MULDER: Turn off that phone. Turn it off.  ,1,12
MULDER: Mulder.  ,1,12
MULDER: Agent Scully believes what we all believe. That you have the kids. Now where are they?  ,1,12
MULDER: Liz Hawley and Jim Summers will be dead.  ,1,12
MULDER: What's the name?  ,1,12
MULDER: Describe him.  ,1,12
MULDER: Where is he?  ,1,12
MULDER: Did you get that?  ,1,12
MULDER: Federal agent!  ,1,12
"MULDER: No matter what, don't believe him. Boggs created this whole charade to get back at me for putting him on death row. You'd be the next best thing.  ",1,12
MULDER: Don't... deal with him. He could be trying to claim you as his last victim.  ,1,12
MULDER: Scully.  ,1,12
"MULDER: Dana. After all you've seen, after all the evidence, why can't you believe?  ",1,12
MULDER: You couldn't face that fear? Even if it meant never knowing what your father wanted to tell you?  ,1,12
MULDER: How?  ,1,12
MULDER: Thanks for the call.  ,1,13
"MULDER: Five deaths. Four in the last six weeks between here and Boston. In each case, the victim dies in the throes of passion. Two women and three men, including the last one.  ",1,13
MULDER: All with symptoms of massive coronary arrest.  ,1,13
"MULDER: The oldest drug, not even illegal. Each body showed the presence of huge amounts of pheromones.  ",1,13
"MULDER: Radar love. Only about a hundred times stronger than found anywhere in nature, strong enough to product anaphylactic shock or a coronary.  ",1,13
"MULDER: It's been done, but in nowhere near these concentrations and hold on to your hat, Scully, 'cause you're gonna love this. The pheromones we're talking about - they contain human DNA.  ",1,13
"MULDER: I don't know. But if it's true, then this guy is a walking aphrodysiac. He's the ultimate sex magnet.  ",1,13
MULDER: I know. That is a puzzle.  ,1,13
"MULDER: It gets weirder. As I said, there's been four deaths matching this MO in the last six weeks - in Boston, Hartford, Philadelphia and here in Washington.  ",1,13
"MULDER: There was a death I made a note of about a year ago with the same symptoms. A 32 year-old UMW labor organizer was found dead outside a town called Steveston in the woods of Massachusetts, home to a sect of religious isolationists called 'The Kindred'.  ",1,13
MULDER: The Kindred are known for their handmade stoneware pottery. They mine the clay themselves in the local hills.  ,1,13
MULDER: The white clay in those hills is particular to that region. It's also the same substance I scraped out of the scratches on the latest victim's sides.  ,1,13
"MULDER: Yes, but it looks as if one of them may have forgotten to clean under his fingernails.  ",1,13
"MULDER: Excuse me, ma'am, this is federal Agent Scully, I'm Agent Mulder.  ",1,13
"MULDER: What can you tell me about the Kindred? They keep pretty much to themselves, huh?  ",1,13
MULDER: What about the missing ones?  ,1,13
MULDER: Can I take a look at them?  ,1,13
MULDER: How would I get up to see them?  ,1,13
"MULDER: Excuse me. Ladies? (they pay no attention and enter the store) (to Scully) I think I'm gonna go inside. (in a ""rural"" accent) You need anything from the feed store?  ",1,13
"MULDER: Scully, what are you doing?  ",1,13
MULDER: You all right?  ,1,13
MULDER: You want to sit down?  ,1,13
MULDER: Interesting way of life. You get any sense about them?  ,1,13
"MULDER: Oh, I've been saying that for years.  ",1,13
"MULDER: Oh, for a 4-wheel drive. Looks like about a mile walk.  ",1,13
MULDER: Now ... this ... that's west.  ,1,13
MULDER: (annoyed) That we should be there already.  ,1,13
"MULDER: I'm Agent Mulder, this is Agent Scully. We're here to investigate a murder.  ",1,13
MULDER: We can't do that.  ,1,13
MULDER: I was wondering if we might ask a few questions. We're looking for someone we believe may have come from here.  ,1,13
"MULDER: If we can arrange for you to look at the video tape, maybe you can identify the individual.  ",1,13
"MULDER: Five murders, so far.  ",1,13
MULDER: Has anyone left here recently?  ,1,13
MULDER: That's all right. We didn't take any offense.  ,1,13
MULDER: Thanks for your cooperation.  ,1,13
MULDER: The Addams family finds religion.  ,1,13
"MULDER: You believe all that back there, Scully?  ",1,13
"MULDER: All that ""we take care of our own"" business?  ",1,13
MULDER: I think it was all an elaborate act.  ,1,13
"MULDER: No, all this simple life, living from abundance crap. These people know something, Scully. You can see it in their eyes - the way they look at one another.  ",1,13
"MULDER: Did you notice how they managed not to answer a single question of ours? And that outburst at the table was right on cue. Somehow, they got us to answer their questions. Did you ask yourself why there weren't any children around?  ",1,13
"MULDER: You want to know what was really odd? You know those pictures we saw down in the store in Steveston today, the ones from the thirties? I swear I saw some of those same faces at the dinner table tonight.  ",1,13
MULDER: Maybe. Maybe not everything is as black and white as it appears to be.  ,1,13
MULDER: I'm going to go back for a little look-see.  ,1,13
MULDER: Maybe they went to the movies. Do you hear that?  ,1,13
MULDER: I think I want to see what's in that cellar.  ,1,13
MULDER: (loud whisper) Scully ...  ,1,13
MULDER: (in the hallway) Scully?  ,1,13
MULDER: Get off of her!  ,1,13
MULDER: What the hell were you doing back there?  ,1,13
MULDER: You don't know?  ,1,13
MULDER: You all right?  ,1,13
MULDER: How you feeling?  ,1,13
MULDER: Why? You don't remember any of it.  ,1,13
MULDER: Why didn't you get out of there before he ...  ,1,13
MULDER: How did you know he wasn't the killer?  ,1,13
MULDER: Just Brother what's-his-name buried in some gopher hole in the wall. Buried alive.  ,1,13
"MULDER: Because I was in there with him. And his face was ... was different. Even his hair, it was almost feminine. It was like he was going through some kind of a transformation.  ",1,13
MULDER: That would explain the hotel security video.  ,1,13
"MULDER: I know what I saw, Scully. And I saw you about to do the wild thing with some stranger.  ",1,13
MULDER: Maybe it's the sex that kills.  ,1,13
MULDER: I don't know.  ,1,13
MULDER: What do you remember?  ,1,13
"MULDER: Try to remember, Michael. The policeman at the scene supports what you said, but maybe there was something ... unusual about this woman. Something you wouldn't feel comfortable telling the police on the record.  ",1,13
MULDER: Absolutely.  ,1,13
MULDER: Scout's honor.  ,1,13
MULDER: I think Don Juan in there knows the difference between the male and the female of the species.  ,1,13
MULDER: Delivery!  ,1,13
MULDER: (breaking in door) FBI! FBI! Clear! Stay down!  ,1,13
MULDER: Scully?  ,1,13
MULDER: (groggily) Scully. Down the stairs ...  ,1,13
MULDER: Scully!  ,1,13
MULDER: No earthly means of transportation.  ,1,13
MULDER: Still missing. He hasn't been home or checked in with the office. I heard something on the way down about a mutilation?  ,1,14
MULDER: You said he was chasing this guy for almost a year?  ,1,14
MULDER: What are you thinking?  ,1,14
MULDER: That still doesn't explain why he would just vanish. Dupre's partner-- who was she? (reads a chart) Lula Phillips.  ,1,14
MULDER: He was a prison guard.  ,1,14
"MULDER: It says here she was released on May 2, 1993.  ",1,14
MULDER: Lovely couple.  ,1,14
MULDER: Thats a lot of money now that she doesnt have to split it two ways.  ,1,14
MULDER: They were married.  ,1,14
MULDER: I dont think this was a simple necrophiliac mutilation. Willis sliced and diced those fingers to get at the wedding ring.  ,1,14
MULDER: You can see by these two bifurcations here that whoever held that cleaver was using his left hand.  ,1,14
MULDER: Willis is right-handed. I checked his pistol grip at the armory. But all the bank surveillance tapes show that Dupre is left-handed.  ,1,14
MULDER: How long did Willis flatline before you revived him?  ,1,14
"MULDER: This is the EKG strip that recorded his cardiac activity at the time. Now, *in your medical opinion,* what does that look like?  ",1,14
MULDER: (leading tone) But what does it *look* like?  ,1,14
"MULDER: Now, you say Dupre and Willis went into cardiac arrest at the exact same time, right?  ",1,14
"MULDER: Which means for minutes, both men were technically dead.  ",1,14
MULDER: You resuscitated his body.  ,1,14
"MULDER: Two men died in that crash room, Scully. One man came back. The question is  which one?  ",1,14
MULDER: Dr. Varnes believes this burst of energy is responsible for the transformational nature of the experience.  ,1,14
MULDER: What about the negative consequences?  ,1,14
MULDER: Thats a nice story.  ,1,14
"MULDER: I sense a big ""but"" coming.  ",1,14
MULDER: For instance?  ,1,14
MULDER: How well do you know him?  ,1,14
MULDER: The plot thickens.  ,1,14
MULDER: Do you believe hes predisposed to this type of psychotic episode?  ,1,14
MULDER: Was the television turned on when they found him?  ,1,14
"MULDER: I dont think Tommy was much a reader since he doesnt seem to have owned any books and from the position of the body, Id say maybe he was watching the tube when he was shot.  ",1,14
MULDER: (to SCULLY) Looks like you were right.  ,1,14
"MULDER: Jack, good to see you back among the living.  ",1,14
MULDER: Thats fancy shooting.  ,1,14
"MULDER: (looking at target) Well, by the looks of it, I wouldnt worry about recertification.  ",1,14
"MULDER: Yeah. Its, uh, Scullys birthday and I was wondering if youd sign that for her.  ",1,14
"MULDER: (smugly) Happy Birthday, Scully.  ",1,14
MULDER: Its from Willis. I thought you two had the same birthday.  ,1,14
"MULDER: Well, thats news to him. I asked him to sign it. And he signed it with his left hand. (sits at his desk)  ",1,14
MULDER: Yeah. After I found out that the evidence from the Phillips murder is missing.  ,1,14
MULDER: The print we lifted. Our best lead is gone. Someone stole it before the lab had a chance to take a look at it.  ,1,14
MULDER: Im not sure Willis is Willis. (SCULLY sighs and rolls her eyes.) Can you at least accept the possibility that during his near-death experience some kind of psychic transference occurred?  ,1,14
MULDER: Did you forget how to sign your name? This is a copy of the automobile requisition form Willis filed the day before he was shot. Compare the signatures.  ,1,14
MULDER: Because it wasnt Willis who answered the hot line.  ,1,14
"MULDER: (tense) Forget it, Bruskin.  ",1,14
"MULDER: (really tense) I said forget it, Bruskin.  ",1,14
MULDER: It doesnt matter what I think. Were still after the same thing. (MULDERs cell phone rings. He answers it.) Mulder.  ,1,14
MULDER: (on phone) Yeah.  ,1,14
MULDER: (on phone) Willis?  ,1,14
MULDER: (on phone) Wheres Scully?  ,1,14
MULDER: (on phone) Let me talk to her.  ,1,14
"MULDER: (on phone) Dana, are you okay?  ",1,14
"MULDER: (voice, on phone) Dana?  ",1,14
MULDER: Katensville PD just reported a drugstore was broken into right here on the corner of Old Forge Road and Madison and Im betting that Scully is somewhere within this five mile radius.  ,1,14
MULDER: 200 units of NPH insulin were taken with a box of syringes. Willis is diabetic.  ,1,14
MULDER: (on phone) Mulder.  ,1,14
MULDER: (on phone) Wheres Willis?  ,1,14
MULDER: (on phone) Let me talk to Scully.  ,1,14
MULDER: (on phone) We dont deal unless we know Scully is alive.  ,1,14
"MULDER: (on phone, threatening) You listen to me --- you lay one hand on Scully, and so help me, God ----  ",1,14
"MULDER: (looking at paper, then crumpling it) Forget it. Its Scullys cellular number. Theyre using her phone. We cant trace them. (angrily throws the wadded paper across the room.)  ",1,14
"MULDER: Yeah, but can you squelch the voice even more this time?  ",1,14
MULDER: There. That engine sound.  ,1,14
MULDER: Is that a small plane?  ,1,14
MULDER: (under his breath) Great!  ,1,14
"MULDER: Okay, from our last phone contact weve identified what sounds like light aircraft taking off. Now, Washington County Regional Airport happens to fall within our area, just south of the state line. Since takeoffs are north to south its a fair bet that our target area lies along this flight path. For those of you who remember ninth-grade math that gives us an area of just over three square miles to cover --- roughly 1000 households. With 100 law enforcement officials at our disposal at about 30 households per man per hour we should be able to canvass the entire area in about three hours. Agent Bruskin will grid the target area and divide it among the teams.  ",1,14
"MULDER: And for those of you ---who dont know already (voice unsteady) this ones important to me. So, uh, lets do it right. Thanks.  ",1,14
MULDER: (into radio) Ditto. Hold your positions. Keep radios at two.  ,1,14
MULDER: How do we look?  ,1,14
MULDER: We will soon enough.  ,1,14
MULDER: FB ----  ,1,14
"MULDER: (concerned) Scully, are you okay?  ",1,14
MULDER: Hi. I got this from the morgue along with the rest of his personal effects. I thought you might want it.  ,1,14
MULDER: (indicating box on the desk) Next of kin?  ,1,14
MULDER: (bitterly) The official story.  ,1,14
MULDER: Fugitive Lula Phillips died yesterday in a shoot-out with federal agents which also resulted in the death of Special Agent Jack Willis  killed in the line of duty.  ,1,14
MULDER: (starts to leave) Good night.  ,1,14
MULDER: (turns back to her) The exact time that Jack went into cardiac arrest at the hospital.  ,1,14
MULDER: It means  It means whatever you want it to mean. (gently) Good night.  ,1,14
MULDER: Robbing a jewelry store is a federal crime.  ,1,15
"MULDER: I don't know. I got a call from some guy I used to work with over at the violent crimes section, said it was important.  ",1,15
MULDER: Reggie! Reggie!  ,1,15
MULDER: This is Special Agent Scully. Reggie Purdue.  ,1,15
MULDER: You guys turn up anything?  ,1,15
MULDER: Why?  ,1,15
"MULDER: Wait, wait a second...  ",1,15
MULDER: What about witness descriptions?  ,1,15
"MULDER: Damn it, Reggie, that's Barnett.  ",1,15
"MULDER: It was my first case at the bureau. Barnett was doing armed jobs all over D.C. and getting away with it, very trigger-happy. Killed seven people. There was this big task force, Reggie was my ASAC. I was twenty-eight years old, right out of the academy. I had this theory on the case. Reggie thought I was full of it. I was full of it.  ",1,15
MULDER: That Barnett had an inside connection. An employee at the armored car company was tipping him off about large shipments of cash. Turns out I was sort of right.  ,1,15
"MULDER: Yeah, we planted bogus waybills, manifests with the armored car company to try to set a trap but Barnett was way ahead of us. That's... when the notes started.  ",1,15
"MULDER: Clever, huh?  ",1,15
"MULDER: No, we did. We did, but not, uh, not clean. An agent died because I screwed up.  ",1,15
"MULDER: He avoided the death penalty on a technicality. But he went down for every job he did. Consecutive terms, three-hundred-and-forty years. The judge promised me he would die in prison.  ",1,15
"MULDER: No, that's just it. He did die in prison, four years ago.  ",1,15
MULDER: I was paying attention.  ,1,15
"MULDER: Yeah, I play golf with him every Sunday. What do you think?  ",1,15
"MULDER: You're slipping, Henderson.  ",1,15
"MULDER: Yeah... seriously, what do you think?  ",1,15
"MULDER: Yeah, does it match Barnett?  ",1,15
MULDER: But you're not sure?  ,1,15
MULDER: Could it have been traced over an old note of Barnett's?  ,1,15
"MULDER: Thanks, Henderson, I owe you one.  ",1,15
MULDER: Ninety-five percent sure it's Barnett's handwriting.  ,1,15
"MULDER: Federal Bureau of Prisons sent me a copy of his death certificate. ""Name of deceased, Barnett, John Irvin. Cause of death, cardiac arrest. Date, September sixteenth, 1989.""  ",1,15
MULDER: The note was written in the last forty-eight hours.  ,1,15
MULDER: No prints.  ,1,15
MULDER: Revenge from the grave? That'd be a neat trick.  ,1,15
MULDER: And he showed you the videotape?  ,1,15
"MULDER: Did I? Steve Wallenberg had a wife and two kids. One of his boys is an all-star on his football team now. If I had pulled the trigger two seconds earlier and Wallenberg would be here to see his kid play. Instead, I got some dead man robbing jewelry stores and sending me haikus.  ",1,15
"MULDER: I'll get you, you son of a bitch!  ",1,15
"MULDER: Barnett said he'd get me, you were there.  ",1,15
MULDER: Apparently not.  ,1,15
"MULDER: It's Barnett, Reggie.  ",1,15
"MULDER: I don't know, I just feel it.  ",1,15
MULDER: And now?  ,1,15
MULDER: I've heard this story.  ,1,15
MULDER: What? Are you saying that somebody from the bureau's behind this?  ,1,15
MULDER: Killing a sales clerk just to leave me a note? I'd say that's going a little out of your way.  ,1,15
"MULDER: He's older now, he may have put on some weight.  ",1,15
MULDER: Five years.  ,1,15
"MULDER: Yes, I felt that he was, uh, daring us to catch him. That he killed his victims almost as if it were part of a game.  ",1,15
"MULDER: We had a customs warehouse at the airport staked out. Now, we knew that Barnett had someone working for the armored car transport tipping him off about large cash shipments but we never figured that he would actually be inside the vehicle when it arrived. That's how Barnett was able to take the driver of the vehicle hostage.  ",1,15
"MULDER: Yes, ma'am.  ",1,15
MULDER: We surrounded Barnett. We ordered him to surrender his hostage and his weapon.  ,1,15
MULDER: I was right behind Barnett.  ,1,15
"MULDER: Yes, ma'am.  ",1,15
"MULDER: Well, it's against F.B.I. regulations to unnecessarily endanger the life of a hostage.  ",1,15
"MULDER: The suspect, uh, John Barnett, fired his weapon point-blank at the hostage and then he turned his gun on Steve Wallenberg... shot him in the face.  ",1,15
MULDER: He gunned him down just for spite.  ,1,15
MULDER: This is a man with a wife and two small children...  ,1,15
"MULDER: ...and you, you shot him without hesitation, without conscience, without an ounce of humanity.  ",1,15
"MULDER: Which is why you should die like an animal, you son of a bitch!  ",1,15
MULDER: I'll need printouts of every variation.  ,1,15
MULDER: What did they come up with?  ,1,15
MULDER: You knew John Barnett?  ,1,15
MULDER: How well did you know him?  ,1,15
MULDER: Are you aware that Barnett died of cardiac arrest in this facility in 1989?  ,1,15
MULDER: Why do you say that?  ,1,15
MULDER: Was it Doctor Ridley?  ,1,15
MULDER: I know what I'm not going to do. I'm not going to hang around and wait for Barnett to send me another valentine.  ,1,15
"MULDER: I didn't know you believe in ghosts, Scully.  ",1,15
MULDER: Mulder.  ,1,15
MULDER: Barnett?  ,1,15
"MULDER: Well, you know, shouldn't I be?  ",1,15
MULDER: In some states. What makes you think I'm taping you?  ,1,15
MULDER: What state are you in?  ,1,15
MULDER: I don't think so.  ,1,15
"MULDER: How do I know it's really you, Barnett?  ",1,15
"MULDER: I don't know, what did you tell me in the courtroom?  ",1,15
"MULDER: Listen, by all accounts, John Barnett is a dead man.  ",1,15
MULDER: Fine. I just need confirmation that you are who you say you are.  ,1,15
MULDER: Barnett? You there?  ,1,15
"MULDER: Yeah, he was hip to the trace.  ",1,15
MULDER: John Barnett was from New Hampshire. He had a slight accent. Listen to this.  ,1,15
MULDER ON RECORDER: I just need confirmation that you are who you say you are.  ,1,15
"MULDER: I don't know, but that is... John Barnett. I'm sure of it.  ",1,15
"MULDER: Reggie, it's Mulder.  ",1,15
"MULDER: IT'S ONLY 10:45, old man.  ",1,15
"MULDER: Listen, Reggie, it doesn't look like Barnett's dead after all.  ",1,15
MULDER: I got an inmate at the prison who swears he saw Barnett alive the night they say he died.  ,1,15
"MULDER: No, listen, Reggie, there's just one thing that doesn't make sense to me.  ",1,15
MULDER: That Agent Henderson said that that note that was left at the jewelry store was written by a right-hander.  ,1,15
"MULDER: Well, this inmate at the prison swears he saw Barnett's right hand amputated.  ",1,15
MULDER: His wife died of cancer six years ago. Never liked to talk about it.  ,1,15
MULDER: I'm just thinking how different things would've been if I would've taken that shot at Barnett when I had it.  ,1,15
MULDER: Would you be able to tell if this note was written by somebody using a prosthetic hand?  ,1,15
MULDER: So you think it's the same person that wrote the first note.  ,1,15
MULDER: Yeah.  ,1,15
MULDER: What do you mean?  ,1,15
MULDER: Where does it say that?  ,1,15
MULDER: What kind of research?  ,1,15
MULDER: She looks about ninety.  ,1,15
MULDER: What's the cause of death?  ,1,15
MULDER: Is that Doctor Ridley?  ,1,15
MULDER: Why wasn't he allowed to?  ,1,15
MULDER: What?  ,1,15
MULDER: Ridley's found a way.  ,1,15
"MULDER: He wanted human research subjects, right? Prisoners. Prisoners like John Barnett.  ",1,15
"MULDER: Well, what would you have said twenty years ago about gene splicing, DNA fingerprinting, cloning, artificial intelligence?  ",1,15
MULDER: I want to age him backwards now. Let's start with ten years.  ,1,15
"MULDER: If you're really Doctor Joseph Ridley, where've you been for the past five years?  ",1,15
MULDER: What about Barnett?  ,1,15
MULDER: What about you?  ,1,15
MULDER: And what about Barnett?  ,1,15
MULDER: Barnett's not dying.  ,1,15
MULDER: You were able to grow John Barnett a new hand?  ,1,15
MULDER: Until John Barnett.  ,1,15
MULDER: They financed your research?  ,1,15
MULDER: I wish Agent Perdue were around to appreciate the irony.  ,1,15
"MULDER: Yes, Ridley was...  ",1,15
MULDER: What does he want?  ,1,15
MULDER: Will he get it?  ,1,15
MULDER: You're aware that this... freak of science you're negotiating with is a murderer?  ,1,15
MULDER: I will.  ,1,15
MULDER: What's that?  ,1,15
MULDER: What do you mean?  ,1,15
MULDER: Scully...  ,1,15
MULDER: Mulder.  ,1,15
MULDER: The rest of my friends?  ,1,15
MULDER: You're not that smart.  ,1,15
"MULDER: Well, you won't get that chance.  ",1,15
MULDER: What does Barnett know about your phone messages?  ,1,15
MULDER: Where's that?  ,1,15
"MULDER: Before the performance and during, we're working at a disadvantage because we don't know exactly what Barnett looks like. Study each of these faces. Know them, particularly the eyes.  ",1,15
"MULDER: We know that if he shows, he'll be keying on Scully. So wherever she is, she should not leave your sight. We've got two hours before the performance. Know this place inside and out. We don't want any shots fired if we can help it. We want to take Barnett alive, okay?  ",1,15
MULDER: Let's make sure it's not the last time.  ,1,15
MULDER: Down!  ,1,15
"MULDER: Back off, back off...  ",1,15
MULDER: Just let her go.  ,1,15
MULDER: Shut up!  ,1,15
MULDER: Call an ambulance!  ,1,15
MULDER: How you feeling?  ,1,15
"MULDER: That bullet went through eight layers of kevlar, you're lucky to be alive.  ",1,15
"MULDER: Well, they flew in three specialists to try to save his life. That guy in the ugly suit there is probably C.I.A. Been trying to talk to him.  ",1,15
"MULDER: Yeah, but he's not talking.  ",1,15
"MULDER: Tells you a lot about the book, doesn't it?  ",1,15
MULDER: Bastard will take that research with him to the grave.  ,1,15
"MULDER: Who knows? If Barnett didn't destroy it, he could have stashed it anywhere. Which would have a cruel irony, wouldn't it? Scientific knowledge that could change the course of mankind buried out in a field somewhere or in some safe deposit box. Getting old, just like the rest of us.  ",1,15
"MULDER: And when they do... maybe he can get his revenge from beyond the grave but somehow, I feel like we haven't heard the last from John Barnett.  ",1,15
MULDER: Conceivably.  ,1,16
MULDER: Possibly.  ,1,16
MULDER: Its feasible.  ,1,16
MULDER: Swamp gas?  ,1,16
MULDER: Happens to me when I eat Dodger Dogs. How can a dozen witnesses including a squad of police vehicles in three counties become hysterical over swamp gas?  ,1,16
"MULDER: The only question for me is, why was the truck driver singled out?  ",1,16
"MULDER: Yeah, it can play tricks on you. But not like this.  ",1,16
"MULDER: Mr. Ranheim, Id appreciate it if you could elaborate on the report you filed last night regarding your encounter.  ",1,16
"MULDER: Last night, you said it was cigar-shaped and black.  ",1,16
"MULDER: Ok. So, how long have you not been yourself?  ",1,16
MULDER: Id like to examine the truck.  ,1,16
MULDER: This man has had an alleged close encounter. The truck undoubtedly contains important trace evidence.  ,1,16
MULDER: Not not here.  ,1,16
MULDER: Its obvious someone got to the police chief. Ranheim was hiding something.  ,1,16
MULDER: He only became sick last night.  ,1,16
MULDER: UFOs are frequently witnessed by soldiers during wartime.  ,1,16
MULDER: What if thats what made the soldiers in Iraq sick? The exhaust or fuel from a classified aircraft or its weapon.  ,1,16
"MULDER: Theyd deny it, but it could possibly explain how Ranheim developed his symptoms.  ",1,16
MULDER: I want to talk to some people when we get back to Washington.  ,1,16
"MULDER: No, these guys are like an extreme government watchdog group. They publish a magazine called The Lone Gunman. Some of their information is first-rate; covert actions, classified weapons. Some of their ideas are downright spooky.  ",1,16
MULDER: Is that so?  ,1,16
MULDER: Barney?  ,1,16
"MULDER: Settle down, Frohike.  ",1,16
"MULDER: Hey, Byers, it is a federal crime to deface money.  ",1,16
"MULDER: O o ok, alright. What do you know about the Gulf War Syndrome?  ",1,16
MULDER: Have you heard of any classified planes being flown during the Persian Gulf War?  ,1,16
MULDER: What about UFO activity during that period?  ,1,16
MULDER: I think its remotely plausible that someone might think youre hot.  ,1,16
MULDER: Whats the matter?  ,1,16
MULDER: Hello?  ,1,16
MULDER: Yeah. What are we doing here?  ,1,16
MULDER: Thats too bad. Something tells me you have the connections to get great seats.  ,1,16
MULDER: Its just a tourist.  ,1,16
"MULDER: What am I onto? We go down to investigate a truck drivers encounter with a UFO and the next thing, were discovering electronic surveillance equipment. Whos listening to us?  ",1,16
MULDER: We had it.  ,1,16
MULDER: Lets just say its a source with a deep background.  ,1,16
MULDER: All I know is that hes guided us away from harm.  ,1,16
MULDER: That tells me that not everything is as it appears to be.  ,1,16
MULDER: Hes never lied to me. I wont break that confidence. I trust him.  ,1,16
MULDER: Then youre gonna have to trust me.  ,1,16
"MULDER: Ok, weve got to try and intercept it and see whats on board.  ",1,16
MULDER: You risked exposure coming here.  ,1,16
MULDER: Is that where the Iraqi wreckage is being held? Are UFOs monitoring the area?  ,1,16
"MULDER: Wait, wait.  ",1,16
"MULDER: This is the best photographic evidence I have ever seen. When I first saw the Gulf Breeze photos, I knew they were a hoax but this this is the quality of evidence the government has amassed for decades at the highest classified levels. That business with the truck was just a decoy to keep anyone from looking closely away from Fort Benning where they are keeping the remains of the Iraqi UFO. We have to leave for Georgia immediately, Scully  ",1,16
MULDER: What?  ,1,16
MULDER: There can be an off-camera light source creating that shadow.  ,1,16
MULDER: Theres probably a degree of tint in the windshield or the gradation could be attributed to atmospheric conditions.  ,1,16
"MULDER: Why dont you just admit it, Scully? Youre determined not to believe him.  ",1,16
MULDER: I am determined to follow a lead that may result in proof of the existence of extraterrestrial biological entities. I need to go.  ,1,16
MULDER: No.  ,1,16
MULDER: Thank you.  ,1,16
"MULDER: I had the photo analyzed by the bureaus computers. Initially, it appears to be legitimate. The film grain matches, the pattern and density, color levels, shading then I noticed this.  ",1,16
MULDER: The photograph was a fake.  ,1,16
MULDER: I thought you were my ally.  ,1,16
"MULDER: Yeah, imagine if Eisenhower told the rest of the Allies that D-Day would take place in Belgium.  ",1,16
MULDER: Then why did you lie to me?  ,1,16
MULDER: Who are you to decide that for me?  ,1,16
"MULDER: Dangerous. You mean in a sense of outrage like the reaction to the Kennedy assassinations or M.I.A.s or radiation experiments on terminal patients, Watergate, Iran-Contra, Roswell, the Tuskegee experiments, where will it end? Oh, I guess it wont end as long as men like you decide what is truth. That transcript you gave me of the Iraqi pilot, that was the truth, wasnt it?  ",1,16
MULDER: Whyd you even bother to show it to me?  ,1,16
"MULDER: Hey, Scully, glad you could drop by.  ",1,16
"MULDER: I been thinking about this whole situation, yknow? And I think youre right. I think we won this one, I think we should just move on.  ",1,16
"MULDER: Called every weigh station and bureau office west of Colorado. Tied up an airphone for three hours. I dont speak Japanese, but I think some businessman told me to stick a piece of sushi where the sun dont shine.  ",1,16
MULDER: At least we can be sure they didnt trace our call. I couldnt find the truck. Did you have any luck?  ,1,16
"MULDER: Yknow, think about it. This truck drove across America. People it passed on the road probably thought it was hauling auto parts or furniture. Yknow, livestock, whatever. Nobody would have suspected it was hauling a craft from another world.  ",1,16
"MULDER: Well, if that were the case  ",1,16
MULDER: You all right?  ,1,16
MULDER: Come on.  ,1,16
MULDER: Scully?  ,1,16
MULDER: It was an extraterrestrial biological entity alive.  ,1,16
MULDER: I think we were just witness to a rescue mission.  ,1,16
MULDER: Are you asking me if it was real? Did we just have a close encounter?  ,1,16
"MULDER: Whatever they used, we probably havent heard of it. Sound weapons, stealth helicopters with an ultra-intensity light. It doesnt matter, theres no evidence that this was a UFO.  ",1,16
"MULDER: Just to kill us? Yeah, I wondered that myself. Maybe theyre using me against myself like you said before. That I want to believe so badly that Id just accept the obvious conclusions and walk away.  ",1,16
MULDER: Theres still one person in all this who hasnt lied to us. But its not quite someone we can turn to.  ,1,16
"MULDER: (into phone) Leverling and Priest Rapids? East bank of the Columbia River? Did you send a field investigator? And you can substantiate the sighting? Ok, Nick, thanks a lot.  ",1,16
MULDER: And after last nights hoax look at this.  ,1,16
MULDER: Looks like they want their colleague back.  ,1,16
MULDER: Whats over there?  ,1,16
MULDER: Hello.  ,1,16
MULDER: Youve seen UFOs?  ,1,16
MULDER: This is it. Theres Ranheim.  ,1,16
MULDER: Just the kind of challenge theyre looking for.  ,1,16
MULDER: Its Mulder. Turn the tape recorder off.  ,1,16
MULDER: Turn it off!  ,1,16
"MULDER: How would you like to have, on your front page, the first substantiated photo of an extraterrestrial biological entity?  ",1,16
MULDER: Just hack me some identification numbers.  ,1,16
MULDER: Braidwood and Stefoff.  ,1,16
MULDER: 7-5-9-3.  ,1,16
MULDER: Thanks.  ,1,16
"MULDER: Langly said he couldnt get into Level 6, so thats where we  ",1,16
"MULDER: We have to go back, we have to go through that door.  ",1,16
"MULDER: Well, well have to find another access, then. Come on.  ",1,16
"MULDER: Yeah, were lost, were just looking for, were trying to  ",1,16
"MULDER: Yeah, if you could help us  ",1,16
MULDER: Im wondering which lie to believe.  ,1,16
MULDER: Where'd you get this?  ,1,17
MULDER: Reverend Calvin Hartley.  ,1,17
"MULDER: The boy's his adopted son, Samuel. He claims to have found him as an infant lying in the tall weeds on the banks of the muddy Mississippi.  ",1,17
MULDER: It's more than a claim. The man he saved appears as a regular attraction in the Reverend's tent ministry. The boy's been performing miracles every week for the past ten years. Twice on Sundays.  ,1,17
MULDER: For what? Fraud?  ,1,17
MULDER: What was the cause of death?  ,1,17
MULDER: When do we leave for Tennessee?  ,1,17
MULDER: I think I saw some of these same people at Woodstock.  ,1,17
MULDER: I saw the movie.  ,1,17
"MULDER: No, wait, wait, this is the part where they bring out Elvis.  ",1,17
"MULDER: Well, where is he?  ",1,17
MULDER: Yeah.  ,1,17
"MULDER: Oh, yeah. This is Special Agent Dana Scully.  ",1,17
MULDER: Something tells me you're not a member of the Reverend Hartley's flock.  ,1,17
"MULDER: People want to believe, you know.  ",1,17
"MULDER: Well, even if Hartley and Samuel are fakes, it's still a long way from accusing the boy of murder.  ",1,17
MULDER: You think that's how he killed them? With a touch?  ,1,17
MULDER: Sheriff.  ,1,17
MULDER: Looks like you may have a few believers on the payroll.  ,1,17
MULDER: Let's go.  ,1,17
"MULDER: Hey, Sheriff? What evidence do you have to charge the boy with murder?  ",1,17
"MULDER: Look at him, though. He's drunk.  ",1,17
MULDER: Let me have a minute with him?  ,1,17
"MULDER: Samuel, I'm Agent Mulder. This is Agent Scully - from the FBI. (they sit down with him) Looks like you took quite a beating there.  ",1,17
MULDER: Guilty of murder?  ,1,17
"MULDER: How'd you do it, Samuel?  ",1,17
MULDER: Really? What pain is that?  ,1,17
MULDER: (remaining seated) I want to hear more about this pain. Tell me.  ,1,17
MULDER: What else do you see?  ,1,17
"MULDER: Hey, I need another minute with him.  ",1,17
MULDER: I don't know.  ,1,17
"MULDER: ""And when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. And the locusts covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened and they did eat every herb of the ...  ",1,17
"MULDER: (lying down on the bed) ... land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left.""  ",1,17
"MULDER: Yeah, maybe in a cornfield, but this happened in a courtroom.  ",1,17
MULDER: I had these patient cases sent over from Kenwood County Hospital. These are physician-documented cases of patients who went to Samuel after conventional treatments failed.  ,1,17
"MULDER: I've encountered dozens of psychic healers in the X-Files, but none like this. I think the kid's for real.  ",1,17
"MULDER: Well, western medicine treats the human body in biochemical terms, right?  ",1,17
MULDER: But the body can also be treated as an electromagnetic system.  ,1,17
MULDER: Why not?  ,1,17
"MULDER: Well, you heard him, Scully. He muddied the river of his own faith. That means he's ...  ",1,17
MULDER: Why did you want to speak with us?  ,1,17
MULDER: Samuel's being tried for murder. I think what you need is a good lawyer.  ,1,17
"MULDER: Well, how can you be sure of that?  ",1,17
"MULDER: Somehow, I don't think that argument will work on a jury. And Samuel's confession won't help much, either.  ",1,17
MULDER: Excuse me.  ,1,17
"MULDER: (to Man) Hey, where'd she go?  ",1,17
MULDER: A little girl.  ,1,17
MULDER: It's a girl.  ,1,17
MULDER: A little girl.  ,1,17
MULDER: Do you think the boy really did it?  ,1,17
MULDER: Why not?  ,1,17
MULDER: (smiling) You must have really liked 'The Exorcist'?  ,1,17
MULDER: I thought I saw someone I knew.  ,1,17
MULDER: Why do you say that?  ,1,17
MULDER: I've seen her twice now.  ,1,17
"MULDER: Oh ... I'm not delusional, Scully.  ",1,17
MULDER: You think this is what Margaret Hohman and her parents were imagining?  ,1,17
MULDER: Do I have to?  ,1,17
MULDER: What would cause that?  ,1,17
MULDER: How soon?  ,1,17
"MULDER: See who you can push to have it done, as soon as possible. (He leaves)  ",1,17
MULDER: Samuel? It's Agent Mulder.  ,1,17
MULDER: I want to talk with you. If you'd prefer your attorney were present ...  ,1,17
MULDER: I put a call in to Sheriff Daniels. He's on his way down here. I'm gonna ask him to release you.  ,1,17
MULDER: Did you poison Margaret Hohman?  ,1,17
"MULDER: Did you poison her using potassium or sodium cyanide, because that's what killed her.  ",1,17
"MULDER: You're innocent, Samuel - unless you had a hand in administering it, and I don't think you did.  ",1,17
"MULDER: Well, the evidence will be presented at your arraignment tomorrow. The habeas corpus law will force them to release you, so you might as well go home and get some rest anyway.  ",1,17
"MULDER: Look, Samuel, if you think that the punishment for your sins is the deaths of those people ...  ",1,17
"MULDER: I can't stand here and argue with your Biblical rhetoric, but I do know that the law will find you innocent!  ",1,17
MULDER: You said you could see my pain. Look at me. (Samuel does) What do you see now?  ,1,17
"MULDER: I don't believe you. I've seen her. It was her, wasn't it?  ",1,17
"MULDER: You made her appear to me, didn't you? Look at me.  ",1,17
"MULDER: (loudly) Is she alive? Is that what I'm supposed to believe, or is this a trick?  ",1,17
MULDER: (sighs in exasperation) Jailer!  ,1,17
MULDER: I called you down here to ask you to release the boy.  ,1,17
MULDER: His innocence.  ,1,17
MULDER: I don't want to pick a fight. He seems determined to stay here anyway.  ,1,17
"MULDER: It tells me that you're determined to have him charged, while your real homicide suspect is still at large. (he leaves)  ",1,17
MULDER: What look is that?  ,1,17
MULDER: Clues.  ,1,17
MULDER: Let's find out.  ,1,17
"MULDER: Scully. (showing it to her) It's potato. (looking into the intake) Someone left a trail of food in the ventilation system, leading to the courtroom. You dump your locusts in here ... instant plague.  ",1,17
MULDER: Biological supply houses usually hatch them on order to farms and universities. It shouldn't be too hard to find out who set this up.  ,1,17
MULDER: I'll call an ambulance.  ,1,17
MULDER: Who?  ,1,17
MULDER: (to phone) Mulder.  ,1,17
MULDER: (from outside the door) Scully. (she opens it) Sheriff Daniels just called. Samuel's body is missing from the morgue.  ,1,17
MULDER: Any witnesses?  ,1,17
MULDER: She saw somebody take the body?  ,1,17
"MULDER: What do you mean, not actually?  ",1,17
"MULDER: (heading out of the morgue) You coming, Sheriff?  ",1,17
MULDER: And you're sure it was him?  ,1,17
MULDER: I have a strong sense the Reverend Hartley's not going to be able to give up the pulpit.  ,1,17
"MULDER: It might even strengthen his faith. Remember, the boy did rise from the dead. That kind of thing happens only once or twice every two thousand years or so.  ",1,17
"MULDER: Somehow, I don't think so.  ",1,17
MULDER: I think people are looking hard for miracles ... so hard that maybe they make themselves see what they want to see.  ,1,17
MULDER: Then who or what do you think was responsible?  ,1,18
MULDER: Then are you saying that a person or persons was responsible for this?  ,1,18
MULDER: Can we see the corral?  ,1,18
MULDER: Yeah?  ,1,18
MULDER: What kinds of things?  ,1,18
MULDER: Nope. Not a thing.  ,1,18
"MULDER: Besides which, police and coroner's report make no mention of such an act.  ",1,18
"MULDER: The body's been transferred to the reservation authorities. We're supposed to get in touch with, uh, um, Sheriff Charlie Tskany.  ",1,18
"MULDER: Excuse me, uh, we're not from around here. We're looking for Sheriff Tskany.  ",1,18
"MULDER: Anyone, uh, know Charlie Tskany?  ",1,18
MULDER: How'd you know?  ,1,18
"MULDER: Well, they told me that even though my deodorant's made for a woman, it's strong enough for a man.  ",1,18
MULDER: I want to believe.  ,1,18
MULDER: I think you already know what we're looking for.  ,1,18
MULDER: (interrupting her) We're looking for anything that can create human tracks in one step and animal tracks in the next.  ,1,18
MULDER: Who were they?  ,1,18
MULDER: The woman in the pool hall said that people were afraid of some Indian legend. What do they believe happened in the Parker case?  ,1,18
MULDER: Was the woman in the pool hall his sister?  ,1,18
MULDER: Yeah.  ,1,18
MULDER: We're gonna need to take a look at Joe Goodensnake's dental records.  ,1,18
"MULDER: See, these are the canine cuspids. They're normal.  ",1,18
"MULDER: No, you see the second incisor here is chipped just like the ones in his mouth. These match Joe Goodensnakes'.  ",1,18
"MULDER: Lyle Parker was attacked, he has scars just like Joe. Do you have a facility where we can perform an autopsy?  ",1,18
"MULDER: Well, if Joe's teeth are abnormal, an autopsy might reveal abnormalities in the interior of his anatomy as well.  ",1,18
"MULDER: It's a cremation. After that, we'll have nothing.  ",1,18
MULDER: Charlie? Do you believe that the spirit of Joe Goodensnake is in that room?  ,1,18
"MULDER: A true piece of history, Scully. (he reaches behind the seat to get a file) The very first X-file, initiated by J. Edgar Hoover himself in 1946. (he hands it to Scully) During World War II, a series of murders occurred in and around the northwest, seven here in Browning alone. Each victim was basically ripped to shreds and eaten, as if by a wild animal. However, many of the victims were found at home, as if they allowed their killer to enter. In 1946, police cornered what they believed to be such an animal in a cabin in Glacier National Park. They shot it, but when they went in to retrieve the carcass, they found only the body of Richard Watkins.  ",1,18
"MULDER: The murders stopped that year. Because the cases were unsolved and considered so bizarre, Hoover locked them away, hoping that in time people around here would forget about them.  ",1,18
"MULDER: In '59, '64, '78 and now again in '94. But ... (he reaches back for something else from the back seat)  ",1,18
MULDER: ... these animal-man related murders predate the oldest X-file by 150 years. Members of the Lewis and Clark expedition wrote of Indian men who could change their shape into that of a wolf.  ,1,18
"MULDER: How can you just dismiss the evidence - the tracks in the mud, the shredded skin, a man with the teeth of an animal?  ",1,18
MULDER: Let's hope so.  ,1,18
"MULDER: I read the report of your investigation into the Goodensnake homicide. It was very good, thorough, professional. But what I want to know is off the record. What do you think really happened?  ",1,18
"MULDER: Charlie, do you believe in shape-shifting?  ",1,18
"MULDER: That's not from any animal I've ever seen. Sheriff, I think it's time we had a talk. An exchange of ideas?  ",1,18
MULDER: (to Tskany) What are you hiding?  ,1,18
MULDER: Over? Is that why you wouldn't allow an autopsy on Joe Goodensnake's body? You thought it would all end when he was cremated? What were you afraid we'd find?  ,1,18
MULDER: In 1946? The Watkins case?  ,1,18
"MULDER: (smiling) Just as long as it's not ""Spooky Fox"". Tell me, Ish ... what did you see?  ",1,18
MULDER: The healed scars on Joe Goodensnake's body.  ,1,18
"MULDER: Shortly after, the police killed him.  ",1,18
"MULDER: Eight years later. But with Watkins dead, how could there have been an attack by manitou?  ",1,18
MULDER: Gwen!  ,1,18
MULDER: Let her up.  ,1,18
"MULDER: Yeah, this is Agent Mulder from the FBI. I was told I could reach Agent Scully at this number.  ",1,18
MULDER: So I can reach her there?  ,1,18
MULDER: What's that?  ,1,18
MULDER: Damn! It keeps disconnecting. The mountain must be blocking the signal. How much farther?  ,1,18
MULDER: (whispering loudly) Scully?  ,1,18
MULDER: Augh!  ,1,18
MULDER: I heard it come up here. Come on.  ,1,18
"MULDER: It wasn't a mountain lion, Scully.  ",1,18
MULDER: Where's Gwen? She said she'd come see us before we left.  ,1,18
MULDER: Just pulled up and left? Why would she do that?  ,1,18
MULDER: (shaking Tskany's hand) Thank you.  ,1,18
MULDER: I hope not.  ,1,18
"MULDER: Take a good look, Scully.  ",1,19
"MULDER: Thirty loggers working a clear-cutting contract in Washington State. Rugged, manly men in the full bloom of their manhood.  ",1,19
"MULDER: Anything strange, unexplainable, unlikely... boyfriend?  ",1,19
"MULDER: You give up? Funny, thats apparently what the Federal Forest Service has done as well.  ",1,19
"MULDER: In a word, they vanished. Or so it would appear.  ",1,19
"MULDER: Right. Two weeks ago, the group of loggers I just showed you radioed a message that Spinney and Teague had gone on a spree. Spiking trees, sabotaging equipment, causing general mischief. One week later, all radio communication was cut off.  ",1,19
MULDER: No. The lumber company that employs the men has asked the Federal Forest Service to look into the matter. Two officials were sent in a week ago and no one has heard from them since.  ,1,19
MULDER: Thats what the lumber company and the Federal Forest Service are accusing. Theyve asked the F.B.I. to investigate. I had to pull a few strings to make sure we got the case.  ,1,19
"MULDER: In 1934, long before anyone even knew what an ecoterrorist was, a W.P.A. crew vanished from that same area without a trace. Not one of those men was ever found or heard from again.  ",1,19
MULDER: Not likely. Thats a lot of flannel to be choking down even for Bigfoot.  ,1,19
"MULDER: Hi. Fox Mulder, this is Dana Scully, were with the F.B.I.  ",1,19
MULDER: Whats that in your windshield there? Is that a bullet hole?  ,1,19
MULDER: Somebody took a shot at you?  ,1,19
MULDER: Is that who you think took a shot at you?  ,1,19
"MULDER: Mulder, Scully.  ",1,19
MULDER: So why do the ecoterrorists target you?  ,1,19
"MULDER: You got a spare, dont you?  ",1,19
MULDER: Someone forgot to clean their plate.  ,1,19
MULDER: Party favors.  ,1,19
MULDER: Whats that?  ,1,19
MULDER: Look at that.  ,1,19
MULDER: Made by what?  ,1,19
"MULDER: You alright, Scully?  ",1,19
MULDER: Barely.  ,1,19
MULDER: Itsy-bitsy spider.  ,1,19
MULDER: What are you doing?  ,1,19
MULDER: Lets just hear what he has to say.  ,1,19
"MULDER: Hey, its alright.  ",1,19
MULDER: Happen to who?  ,1,19
MULDER: What happened here?  ,1,19
MULDER: Why not just hike out?  ,1,19
MULDER: What are you guys doing out here?  ,1,19
"MULDER: Just, just hold off a second, okay?  ",1,19
MULDER: I think Im going to suggest that we sleep with the lights on.  ,1,19
MULDER: This tree must be hundreds of years old.  ,1,19
"MULDER: Hey, look at this.  ",1,19
MULDER: I dont think he did it.  ,1,19
"MULDER: Well, hes not going anywhere!  ",1,19
MULDER: Maybe the wood in this ring is different. Theyre feeding on it.  ,1,19
MULDER: Could they have been living in that tree for hundreds of years?  ,1,19
"MULDER: What do you know about insects, Scully?  ",1,19
"MULDER: And theyve been around a long time, right?  ",1,19
"MULDER: And this tree is what, 5, 6, 700 years old?  ",1,19
"MULDER: And these rings represent a history of climatic changes, which means that in this year or season in the life of the tree, there was some kind of strange event that produced an abnormal ring.  ",1,19
MULDER: A volcanic eruption. This whole chain of mountains running from Washington to Oregon is still extremely active. Remember Mt. St. Helens?  ,1,19
"MULDER: When Mt. St. Helens erupted, there was a large amount of radiation that was released from inside the earth. Strange things started to grow. Theres actually this lake where theyve discovered a kind of amoeba that can literally suck a mans brains out.  ",1,19
"MULDER: Well, then maybe what were dealing with isnt a mutation at all. What if its some kind of... extinct insect larvae in that ring, deposited during a period of volcanic activity, brought up through the trees root system. Ancient insect eggs. Thousands, maybe millions of years old lying dormant until...  ",1,19
"MULDER: Yeah, maybe.  ",1,19
MULDER: Doing a little auto repair. Looks to me like youre planning on cutting out of here.  ,1,19
MULDER: So why are you sneaking around?  ,1,19
MULDER: Hes got no reason to. Neither do I.  ,1,19
MULDER: Radio is back up.  ,1,19
MULDER: Im not getting any reception so the reciever could be trashed.  ,1,19
MULDER: We could try.  ,1,19
"MULDER: Well, turn it back on, I got the radio working.  ",1,19
MULDER: Spinney took it.  ,1,19
MULDER: He left earlier this morning. He took a battery and some gas. Hes gonna come back for us in the morning.  ,1,19
"MULDER: He gave me his word, yeah.  ",1,19
"MULDER: Well, what would you have done? At least now weve got one chance of getting out of here alive which is one more chance than we had before.  ",1,19
"MULDER: There is no more gas, the other tanks have all been ruptured or filled with sugar.  ",1,19
"MULDER: Look, its done. I shouldnt have let him go. Lets just move past it, okay?  ",1,19
MULDER: I dont know. Well think of something.  ,1,19
MULDER: We only found one cocoon.  ,1,19
"MULDER: Look, Scully, what would you have done?  ",1,19
"MULDER: Oh, will you cut the sanctimonious crap?  ",1,19
MULDER: Youre right. And were wasting time arguing about it.  ,1,19
"MULDER: Button this place up. If were gonna spend the night in here, weve got to do everything we can to make sure the bugs stay out there.  ",1,19
"MULDER: Its alright, Scully, Scully...  ",1,19
MULDER: Stop moving! Stop!  ,1,19
MULDER: Stand still! Stand still!  ,1,19
MULDER: Theyre not just on you. Theyre everywhere. I think thats what that greasy residue is over everything.  ,1,19
MULDER: We are. I think the light keeps them from swarming. Well be safe as long as we stay in the light.  ,1,19
MULDER: We got an hour and a half till sunrise.  ,1,19
MULDER: Maybe somebody heard our radio transmission. Help could be on the way.  ,1,19
"MULDER: Well, Im not going to give up on Spinney. He gave me his word hed come back to get us.  ",1,19
MULDER: Well think of something.  ,1,19
"MULDER: Maybe we can patch this or at least get it to hold some air. With the spare in your truck, maybe we can limp down the mountain. If not, at least we can get on the radio and warn them whats out there.  ",1,19
MULDER: Yeah.  ,1,19
"MULDER: No, its a jeep!  ",1,19
MULDER: What happened to your friends?  ,1,19
MULDER: Get out of there! Get back in the car!  ,1,19
MULDER: Better. How did the tests come back?  ,1,19
MULDER: Which is what?  ,1,19
MULDER: Scully?  ,1,19
MULDER: I told her it was going to be a nice trip to the forest.  ,1,19
MULDER: And if theyre not?  ,1,19
MULDER: I do.  ,1,20
"MULDER: I'm a special agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, I worked for three years at the F.B.I.'s behavioral science unit profiling serial killers.  ",1,20
"MULDER: Yes, I have.  ",1,20
"MULDER: These murders span nearly a century. Nineteen homicides, five occuring every thirty years since 1903, all in the Baltimore area. In each case, the liver was extracted and presumably eaten.  ",1,20
"MULDER: I contend that perhaps through genetic mutation, Eugene Tooms is capable of contorting and elongating his body in order to gain access to victims so that he may extract the livers which provide him with sustenance for the hibernation period of 30 years. He needs one more liver to complete this cycle.  ",1,20
MULDER: A preliminary examination done at the time of Tooms' arrest revealed abnormalities in his striated muscles and axial bones. His attorney blocked further study...  ,1,20
MULDER: I must ask that you place the safety of...  ,1,20
MULDER: ...the people first and foremost...  ,1,20
MULDER: This is a rare and unusual human creature...  ,1,20
"MULDER: ...who should not be released, but should be retained for further study.  ",1,20
"MULDER: If you release Eugene Tooms, he will kill again. It's in his genetic make-up.  ",1,20
MULDER: I don't care how it sounded as long as it was the truth.  ,1,20
MULDER: What did he want?  ,1,20
MULDER: I'm not taking my eyes off him.  ,1,20
"MULDER: He needs to kill, he'll do it the first chance he can but he won't kill the old couple. He won't be that obvious. Tooms didn't remain a secret for a hundred years by not being careful. Think of him as an animal. He'll only kill out of necessity or self-defense. If he makes an attempt, I'll be there to stop him.  ",1,20
"MULDER: No, I'll watch him. If he can't be tied to the most recent evidence, you'll have to go back to the earlier murders to prove it was him.  ",1,20
MULDER: There's no statute of limitation on murder.  ,1,20
"MULDER: Look, Scully, if you're resistant because you don't believe, I'll respect that. But if you're resistant because of some bureaucratic pressure, they've not only reeled you in. They've already skinned you.  ",1,20
MULDER: Excuse me.  ,1,20
MULDER: F.B.I.  ,1,20
MULDER: Its not enough. It doesnt tie it to Tooms.  ,1,20
MULDER: Pine-scented.  ,1,20
MULDER: Better?  ,1,20
MULDER: Ha-ha.  ,1,20
"MULDER: Article 30, paragraph 8.7?  ",1,20
MULDER: A request for other agents to stake-out Tooms would be denied. Then we have no grounds.  ,1,20
"MULDER: Theyre out to put an end to the X-Files, Scully. I dont know why, but any excuse will do. Now, I dont really care about my record, but youd be in trouble just for sitting in this car and Id hate to see you to carry an official reprimand in your file because of me.  ",1,20
MULDER: And I... I even made my parents call me Mulder. So... Mulder.  ,1,20
"MULDER: If theres an ice tea in that bag, could be love.  ",1,20
"MULDER: Here. Take my sandwich, I only had one bite. Youre gonna want it later, believe me. And youll call me if anything happens, immediately. Ill be here.  ",1,20
MULDER: Yeah.  ,1,20
MULDER: A good forensic scientist would know that there is not only a shoe print but also an impact point from inside the shoe. An indepth analysis of Tooms injury would show that my foot was not inside the shoe at the time of impact.  ,1,20
MULDER: Of course.  ,1,20
MULDER: Thats a good idea. Thanks for your concern.  ,1,20
MULDER: Tooms will never voluntarily submit to a dental cast.  ,1,20
MULDER: That makes five.  ,1,20
"MULDER: Where hes gone for the last ninty years, 66 Exeter Street.  ",1,20
MULDER: Whats there now?  ,1,20
MULDER: Thanks.  ,1,20
MULDER: You can get the next mutant.  ,1,20
"MULDER: Its amazing how things change, isnt it?  ",1,20
"MULDER: No, a change for us. Its coming.  ",1,20
MULDER: A hunch.  ,1,20
MULDER: How'd you hear about us?  ,1,21
MULDER: So you didn't get a description of who the kid saw?  ,1,21
MULDER: Plus jumpers tend to open the window before they jump. Where's the kid now?  ,1,21
MULDER: Like that? (she nods) Was his hair dark like mine or lighter like yours?  ,1,21
MULDER: Michelle? Was his mustache like that? (she nods)  ,1,21
MULDER: Mrs. Bishop?  ,1,21
MULDER: (showing her the sketch) This is the man Michelle says she saw at the police station. Do you recognize him?  ,1,21
MULDER: She also mentioned a friend ... someone named Sheila. Do you know who that is?  ,1,21
MULDER: Look at that? Looks like a hawk or a falcon.  ,1,21
MULDER: Japanese paper folding. Where'd she learn how to do that?  ,1,21
"MULDER: So Harry, you'll put that face into the system?  ",1,21
MULDER: Can you give Scully a ride back into the city?  ,1,21
"MULDER: That's your department. I'm gonna go over to Brylin Hospital, see if I can have a little chat with Michelle's shrink.  ",1,21
"MULDER: Oh, oh, and check for burns or lesions on Barbala's body.  ",1,21
MULDER: Psychokinesis is usually associated with an electrical charge.  ,1,21
MULDER: How else could a 60-pound kid throw a 200-pound detective out the window?  ,1,21
MULDER: Could Michelle have fabricated him?  ,1,21
MULDER: As in schizophrenia?  ,1,21
MULDER: And in Michelle's case?  ,1,21
MULDER: Any theories?  ,1,21
MULDER: Have you tried deep regression hypnosis?  ,1,21
"MULDER: OK. Well, in the meantime, how have you been treating Michelle?  ",1,21
MULDER: I'm sure. Have you observed any unexplained phenomena in Michelle's presence?  ,1,21
"MULDER: Inordinate physical strength, psychic ability, telekinesis...  ",1,21
"MULDER: Hey, you're the one that found a lesion on Barbala's body. You said it could have been caused by an intense concentration of electrothermal energy.  ",1,21
"MULDER: Why is it still so hard for you to believe, even when all the evidence suggests extraordinary phenomena?  ",1,21
MULDER: What?  ,1,21
MULDER: You have the police report describing Morris' death?  ,1,21
MULDER: Does it describe how he was murdered?  ,1,21
MULDER: Give me the grisly details.  ,1,21
"MULDER: This is what Michelle did to a dozen dolls in her shrink's office. Hell of a coincidence, wouldn't you say? Now before we discount anything, I think we should find out more about Charlie Morris. I got the address of his partner on the force. Hopefully, he can tell us something.  ",1,21
MULDER: Detective Fiore? We're with the FBI. Can we talk to you for a minute? Do you know this man?  ,1,21
MULDER: You two were partners?  ,1,21
MULDER: What can you tell us about the circumstances surrounding his death?  ,1,21
"MULDER: Well, we believe that the death of Detective Rudy Barbala yesterday can be linked to the death of Officer Morris nine years ago.  ",1,21
"MULDER: Well, that's what we need your help with. The police report said that Officer Morris was killed off-duty.  ",1,21
MULDER: For what?  ,1,21
MULDER: The Triads.  ,1,21
MULDER: So you think that Charlie Morris was killed as a warning to back off?  ,1,21
MULDER: Is it me or did we just get the brush-off?  ,1,21
MULDER: What?  ,1,21
MULDER: A patrol unit picked her up a few blocks away from the bus stop.  ,1,21
"MULDER: Mrs. Bishop, no one is accusing Michelle of anything.  ",1,21
"MULDER: I'm sorry, excuse me.  ",1,21
MULDER: Three of whom are now dead.  ,1,21
MULDER: And a little girl from Orchard Park.  ,1,21
"MULDER: Morris, Fiore, Barbala and Felder. What's wrong with this picture?  ",1,21
MULDER: Right. Why would he say that?  ,1,21
MULDER: What?  ,1,21
MULDER: Is there a log sheet?  ,1,21
MULDER: May we come in?  ,1,21
MULDER: Scully. Look familiar?  ,1,21
"MULDER: Someone you might have had dinner with once, a friend of Tony's from work? A name you can't remember, anything?  ",1,21
"MULDER: Mrs. Fiore, I couldn't help noticing your origami collection. Did you do all these yourself?  ",1,21
MULDER: Charlie?  ,1,21
"MULDER: Michelle is eight years old, that means that she was conceived at roughly the same time that Officer Morris was killed.  ",1,21
"MULDER: Metempsychosis, transmigration, reimbodiment, call it what you will.  ",1,21
"MULDER: Well, what about the composite drawing and the dolls and the fact that Michelle was witness to two deaths that can be tied to Charlie Morris?  ",1,21
"MULDER: It's not so far-fetched, Scully. Reincarnation is a basic tenet of many major religions.  ",1,21
"MULDER: Well, individuals with strong past-life memories often exhibit enhanced psychic abilities - ESP, telekinesis.  ",1,21
MULDER: One short step away from proving the pre-existence of the human soul.  ,1,21
MULDER: Dr. Spitz has conducted hundreds of these sessions and ...  ,1,21
MULDER: Is it any more dangerous than pumping her full of thorazine?  ,1,21
"MULDER: We almost had it, Scully. We were right there.  ",1,21
MULDER: We'll have to try it again.  ,1,21
"MULDER: Well, we have to change her mind.  ",1,21
MULDER: The truth. What really happened to Charlie Morris nine years ago.  ,1,21
"MULDER: If we find Fiore. And if he's still alive. Scully, you saw what happened in there.  ",1,21
MULDER: All evidence suggests that Michelle Bishop IS Charlie Morris.  ,1,21
"MULDER: Short of her growing a moustache, how much more apparent does it have to become for you to accept it?  ",1,21
"MULDER: (voice-over) The inconclusive results of Michelle's past life regression do not shake my basic belief in hypnosis as a tool for psychological healing. Whether or not it offers us definitive proof of previous lifetimes is another matter. However, in this particular case, all other explanations seem to be even more wanting.  ",1,21
"MULDER: There was a documented case in the early seventies of a man from Porlock, Ohio, who could influence undeveloped film. He could create shapes on the negative from his mind.  ",1,21
MULDER: So you're saying he was drowned first and then mutilated to make it look like a signature execution?  ,1,21
MULDER: Except for what?  ,1,21
"MULDER: You said salt water, right?  ",1,21
"MULDER: So Charlie Morris was drowned in his own tropical fish tank, and that's the last thing he saw before he died. We better hope Michelle Bishop is at home, tucked in bed.  ",1,21
MULDER: (to Scully) Go check out upstairs. (she heads up the stairs)  ,1,21
MULDER: Michelle! This won't make right what happened.  ,1,21
"MULDER: (voice-over) Closing entry, file number X-40271. Detective Anthony Fiore pleaded guilty yesterday in federal court to charges of first-degree murder after the fact, grand larceny and obstruction of justice. The deaths of Detective Rudy Barbala and former police officer Leon Felder are being ruled as accidental, although their complicity in the murder of Officer Charlie Morris has been definitively established. No charges were brought against Michelle Bishop, who today took her first swimming lesson. She claims no memory of the preceding events and both her mother and Dr. Braun have denied my request for a second past-life regression. End of field journal, April 19, 1994.  ",1,21
MULDER: How was the wedding?  ,1,22
MULDER: Did you catch the bouquet?  ,1,22
"MULDER: (handing her the folder) The project that everyone says doesn't exist, does exist.  ",1,22
"MULDER: The next generation in jet engine design, capable of doubling current supersonic speeds using half the fuel. At least in theory.  ",1,22
MULDER: Yes.  ,1,22
"MULDER: I'm not sure, but Surnow is the second scientist on the team to die in the last six months.  ",1,22
"MULDER: There's something unexplainable here, Scully, but it's certainly not unidentifiable.  ",1,22
MULDER: (to a man inside the door) Keats?  ,1,22
"MULDER: Dr. Keats? We're with the FBI. I'm Agent Mulder, this is Agent Scully. (Mulder flashes his badge and they shake hands) We understand you discovered Dr. Surnow this morning.  ",1,22
MULDER: (pointing at the bottom line) Who wrote this?  ,1,22
"MULDER: You see, the handwriting here doesn't seem to match any of the other handwriting on the board.  ",1,22
MULDER: (checking the folder) What about Roland Fuller?  ,1,22
"MULDER: Well, according to the police report, he was the only other person here last night.  ",1,22
"MULDER: Hi, Roland. Do you mind if we sit down?  ",1,22
MULDER: Thanks. You mind if we ask you a couple of questions? Do you remember working last night?  ,1,22
"MULDER: You like numbers, too.  ",1,22
MULDER: Would you do me a favor and try this?  ,1,22
MULDER: It's something Roland was doodling at the home.  ,1,22
"MULDER: Besides Nollette and Keats, he's the only person we can prove was in the lab that night.  ",1,22
"MULDER: Well, you saw his facility with mathematics. Don't some autistic individuals display unusual abilities?  ",1,22
MULDER: I don't think they'll be performing this experiment on Beakman's World. (he walks over to the detective and points at the computer) Has this been dusted?  ,1,22
"MULDER: Hey, Scully! Look at these files. KMAN, must be Keats. His file was turned off at 12:31 last night.  ",1,22
MULDER: And worked on it for nearly 5 hours.  ,1,22
"MULDER: So you're saying someone came in here, killed Keats, and then just did some work on an old Dr. Arthur Grable file?  ",1,22
MULDER: Try 15626.  ,1,22
MULDER: This is Arthur Grable's work on the same fluid dynamics equation the others were working on. (he pages through other graphs) Look at all those entries. Someone has been continuing his work in the six months since he died.  ,1,22
"MULDER: Hey, Roland, you've got more shirts than I do. (holds up a navy blue shirt with white patterns on it) I think this one would look stylin' today. What do you think?  ",1,22
MULDER: The green one?  ,1,22
"MULDER: (pulls out the green shirt) This one? Here you go. So you like your job at the college, Roland?  ",1,22
MULDER: I hear you're very good at it. You remember how you got your job?  ,1,22
MULDER: What man?  ,1,22
MULDER: Was Dr. Grable nice to you?  ,1,22
"MULDER: When was the last time you spoke to him? Last week, the day before?  ",1,22
MULDER: I'm sorry.  ,1,22
MULDER: Roland Fuller was hired by Arthur Grable. He went to the halfway house specifically to find a mentally challenged person.  ,1,22
"MULDER: Well, if he had intentions of killing Nollette, Keats and Surnow, why not set it up to appear the least likely suspect?  ",1,22
"MULDER: Maybe he staged it. That would explain why his work is continuing on, six months after his ""death"".  ",1,22
MULDER: (reading from Roland's file) Roland's also from Seattle. He spent most of his life at the Heritage Halfway House. The identity of his parents has been sealed by the courts. There's very little information on Roland before the age of three. That's when he was put in the Heritage program.  ,1,22
"MULDER: (flipping through some pages) July 15, 1952.  ",1,22
MULDER: Is that you?  ,1,22
MULDER: Cool 'do. What's the story here?  ,1,22
"MULDER: (to Scully) Hmmm, an egghead classic.  ",1,22
"MULDER: Could he be making it seem like a man with a 70 IQ is gaining access to and, uh, operating his old computer files?  ",1,22
"MULDER: The police report on the auto accident that killed Arthur Grable is woefully incomplete. The dry road surface, no mechanical problems found. The body was never admitted to the county morgue and there was no funeral.  ",1,22
MULDER: ... you'll also know how to clone new bodies for them.  ,1,22
MULDER: These fluctuations in temperature - do they happen often?  ,1,22
MULDER: Is it possible the brain is causing the fluctuation?  ,1,22
MULDER: Roland Fuller and Arthur Grable had the same birthday. I think they're twins.  ,1,22
"MULDER: Same age, just less hairy and with better eyesight.  ",1,22
"MULDER: Close cropped hair, with a slightly receding widow's peak. Lose the glasses.  ",1,22
MULDER: Give or take a few pounds.  ,1,22
MULDER: Why not?  ,1,22
"MULDER: (putting his hand on Roland's shoulder) Your dreams are bad, Roland. Not you. You're a good person.  ",1,22
MULDER: Your dreams make you hit Tracy?  ,1,22
"MULDER: You know how to work this toy, Roland?  ",1,22
"MULDER: Now, you see the way you work that toy is like what's happening to you. You're the spaceship, Roland, and your dreams are the controls.  ",1,22
MULDER: (showing him a photo of Arthur Grable) Have you seen this man recently?  ,1,22
"MULDER: (trying to calm him) Roland! Roland! Roland, stop!  ",1,22
MULDER: (heading upstairs with Scully and Mrs. Stodie) We need to arrange to keep Roland under observation.  ,1,22
MULDER: He's trying to get away.  ,1,22
MULDER: Roland! Roland! Roland! Roland! Roland!  ,1,22
MULDER: Nollette's gone. We should arrange a security guard to find him.  ,1,22
"MULDER: You've got a brother, don't you Scully?  ",1,22
"MULDER: Well, have you ever thought about calling one of them all day long and then all of a sudden the phone rings and it's one of them calling you?  ",1,22
"MULDER: I believe in psychic connections, and evidence suggests that it's stronger between family members, strongest of all between twin siblings that shared the same womb.  ",1,22
MULDER: Arthur Grable is not dead. He's in a state of consciousness that no human has ever returned from. And what if that state allows one to develop psychic ability to a potential that the conscious mind is too preoccupied to explore or believe in? He could use that ability to control his brother to kill those scientists.  ,1,22
"MULDER: Well, that's a question that only Dr. Nollette can answer.  ",1,22
MULDER: We've got to find Nollette.  ,1,22
MULDER: We go this way? (pointing straight ahead)  ,1,22
MULDER: Identical twins.  ,1,22
MULDER: I've read studies which suggest that in some cases the identical twin arises very early in the embryonic stage when a mutation in one cell is rejected by the other cells as foreign.  ,1,22
"MULDER: In a way, that would explain Arthur's genius and Roland's strange mathematical gift.  ",1,22
MULDER: Nollette?  ,1,22
"MULDER: (to Roland) Arthur, how do you stop this? Tell me how! Arthur!  ",1,22
"MULDER: Come on, Roland.  ",1,22
MULDER: But we've recommended that he be remanded to your custody as soon as the court deems it appropriate.  ,1,22
MULDER: It's my belief that he wasn't acting under his own volition.  ,1,22
"MULDER: This is the work of Arthur Grable, Roland's brother. It's a new theory of jet propulsion, unfinished at the time of his death. In the last two weeks, Roland has completed the calculations.  ",1,22
MULDER: Mulder.  ,1,23
MULDER: I don't know.  ,1,23
"MULDER: Yeah, that's all he said.  ",1,23
"MULDER: As far as I can tell, he wouldn't pull over for a moving violation.  ",1,23
MULDER: There's got to be something here. Some detail. Something we're not seeing.  ,1,23
MULDER: Why would he do that?  ,1,23
MULDER: I don't think he'd call if there wasn't something here... something I was supposed to see. Something he wants me to see.  ,1,23
MULDER: Hunting a man on a moving violation?  ,1,23
MULDER: The man in the photograph doesn't appear to be wearing a badge or a uniform. He's not one of yours?  ,1,23
MULDER: You say the suspect was shot.  ,1,23
"MULDER: It's been almost eighteen hours, Captain. Where could the body be?  ",1,23
MULDER: The suspect matches the description of a federal fugitive.  ,1,23
"MULDER: If you don't mind, can we take a look at the car, please?  ",1,23
MULDER: I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to find.  ,1,23
MULDER: Look at the car in this photo. Look at the windshield.  ,1,23
"MULDER: So, probably, only a doctor would have that on his car.  ",1,23
"MULDER: I had the picture enhanced and the plate is different. ""3-A-Y-F.""  ",1,23
MULDER: That's all you can make out. The rest is obscured.  ,1,23
"MULDER: Maybe the, uh, real owner of the car has got something to hide.  ",1,23
MULDER: Doctor Berube?  ,1,23
"MULDER: We're with the F.B.I., can we have a minute of your time?  ",1,23
MULDER: I'm sorry. Are you aware that a car registered to you was involved in a high-speed chase in Arlis yesterday?  ,1,23
"MULDER: A silver Ciera, doctor. Do you own a silver Ciera?  ",1,23
MULDER: A crime. Were you aware that it was even missing?  ,1,23
MULDER: What kind of experiment?  ,1,23
MULDER: No.  ,1,23
MULDER: Thank you.  ,1,23
"MULDER: Well, IT'S ALMOST 5:00. We should check with the doctor's housekeeper about the car while we're out here.  ",1,23
"MULDER: ""No?"" What do you mean, ""no?""  ",1,23
"MULDER: Well, that's all we've got.  ",1,23
MULDER: He's in a delicate position. He has access to information and indiscretion could expose him.  ,1,23
MULDER: You think he does it because he gets off on it?  ,1,23
MULDER: My mother usually likes me home before the street lights come on.  ,1,23
MULDER: Why?  ,1,23
MULDER: My level of commitment?  ,1,23
"MULDER: Well, maybe if you'd given me something more to work with.  ",1,23
MULDER: A news report?  ,1,23
MULDER: Not very far.  ,1,23
"MULDER: You know, from day one, this has always been on your terms. I've gone along. Been the dutiful son. But maybe this time, we can just cut out the Obi-Wan Kenobi crap and you can save me the trouble.  ",1,23
MULDER: Let me tell you something. I've got plenty to do without chasing down your vague leads or trying to decode your circular logic. Maybe it's you who's become too dependent on me... on my willingness to play your games.  ,1,23
MULDER: What?  ,1,23
MULDER: Closer to what?  ,1,23
MULDER: Suicide?  ,1,23
MULDER: How?  ,1,23
MULDER: I don't suppose there were any witnesses?  ,1,23
MULDER: The man we met yesterday kept this place like he was waiting for the people from Good Housekeeping to show up. I would have never pegged him as someone to do all this... or a Greg Louganis out the window.  ,1,23
"MULDER: It's a bit too calculated, huh?  ",1,23
MULDER: Yeah. The mapping of all human genes. Maybe the most ambitious scientific endeavor in the history of mankind.  ,1,23
"MULDER: Yeah, but only one who owned a silver Ciera and went bungie-jumping with medical gauze wrapped around his neck.  ",1,23
"MULDER: Well, maybe that's just it. Maybe we're not seeing it because it can't be seen, not in any obvious way. What do you think this is?  ",1,23
"MULDER: Well, can you find out for me?  ",1,23
MULDER: I'll see what else I can find out about Doctor Terrance Allen Berube.  ,1,23
"MULDER: Hi, Danny. Yeah, it's Mulder again. Look, I got a number this time. 555-2804. Area code 301. I need an address, a name if you can get it for me. All right, I'm at... same prefix... fifteen-seventeen. All right, thanks, Danny.  ",1,23
MULDER: Yeah. Who's this?  ,1,23
MULDER: Where are you now?  ,1,23
MULDER: I'm going to pick you up. Where are you?  ,1,23
MULDER: Hello?  ,1,23

MULDER: Yeah...  ,1,23

"MULDER: All right, thanks.  ",1,23
MULDER: Mulder.  ,1,23
"MULDER: He's alive, Scully.  ",1,23
"MULDER: The fugitive, the driver of the silver Ciera. He called the doctor's house while I was there.  ",1,23
MULDER: I don't know. Where are you?  ,1,23
MULDER: Is it smaller than a silver Ciera?  ,1,23
MULDER: What is it?  ,1,23
MULDER: Any idea what he could have been doing with them?  ,1,23
"MULDER: Well, maybe that's what he was doing with those monkeys. Can they tell you anything else there?  ",1,23
"MULDER: Yeah, Scully. Keep up the good work.  ",1,23
MULDER: Hello.  ,1,23
MULDER: I had a situation. I left my phone in the car.  ,1,23
MULDER: Scully...  ,1,23
MULDER: How soon can you be here? There's something I got to show you.  ,1,23
"MULDER: It's all right, don't worry about it.  ",1,23
MULDER: Why? Nobody else does.  ,1,23
"MULDER: Well, whatever it is you do believe, Scully... when you walk into that room? Nothing sacred will hold.  ",1,23
MULDER: Destroyed by whom?  ,1,23
MULDER: I don't believe you.  ,1,23
"MULDER: There were three men last night, I was chased.  ",1,23
MULDER: Doctor Berube was conducting human experiments with extraterrestrial viruses.  ,1,23
MULDER: Roswell?  ,1,23
MULDER: That's how he was able to elude capture.  ,1,23
MULDER: It was just easier to kill Doctor Secare.  ,1,23
MULDER: I'm going to find Doctor Secare.  ,1,23
MULDER: I don't know. I'm going to trust my instincts.  ,1,23
MULDER: Doctor Secare?  ,1,23
MULDER: I'm a popular guy. Why don't you answer it for me?  ,1,23
"MULDER: Hey, Scully. It's me.  ",1,23
MULDER: They called me in tonight...  ,1,23
MULDER: Skinner.  ,1,23
"MULDER: It's over, Scully.  ",1,23
"MULDER: Yes, they can.  ",1,23
MULDER: I'm... not going to give up. I can't give up. Not as long as the truth is out there.  ,1,23
MULDER: We wanted... to believe. We wanted to call out.  ,2,1
"MULDER: A gold-plated record depicting images, music and sounds of our planet, arranged so that it may be understood if ever intercepted by a technologically mature extraterrestrial civilization.  ",2,1

"MULDER: Hes dead, Scully. I attended his funeral at Arlington through eight-power binoculars from a thousand yards away. Now, the picture frame was turned down, you wanted to talk. What have you found?  ",2,1
"MULDER: Its dangerous for us just to have a little chat, Scully. We must assume were being watched.  ",2,1
"MULDER: No, no, of course not. These people are the best.  ",2,1
MULDER: So why have you bothered to come here covertly?  ,2,1
MULDER: So what do you want?  ,2,1

"MULDER: No, it...  ",2,1
MULDER: Have you ever been to San Diego?  ,2,1
MULDER: Did you check out the Palomar observatory?  ,2,1
"MULDER: From 1948 until recently, it was the largest telescope in the world. The idea and design came from a brilliant and wealthy astronomer named George Ellery Hale. Actually, the idea was presented to Hale one night. While he was playing billiards, an elf climbed in his window and told him to get money from the Rockefeller Foundation for a telescope.  ",2,1
MULDER: In my case... little green men.  ,2,1

MULDER: And all the sewage comes through this plant?  ,2,2

MULDER: How did you make the connection at all?  ,2,2
"MULDER: Well, that's just an unexpected response, considering the bizarre nature of the case... and of the suspect.  ",2,2
MULDER: There's no way you'll prosecute this.  ,2,2
MULDER: This is not a man. It's a monster. You can't put it in an institution.  ,2,2
MULDER: Two?  ,2,2
"MULDER: You know, you had a pair of agents that could have handled a case like this. Agent Scully and I might have been able to save that man's life, but you shut us down.  ",2,2
MULDER: What do you got?  ,2,2
"MULDER: Watch all the storm drains, any access to the sewer system. It's going to try to get back underground.  ",2,2
MULDER: Who am I speaking to?  ,2,2
MULDER: Yes. Why is it imperative?  ,2,2
MULDER: The tanker.  ,2,2
MULDER: What if he's on the tanker truck?  ,2,2
MULDER: So he could have already been here and gone?  ,2,2
MULDER: And every tanker dumps it's load here?  ,2,2
MULDER: Everything is processed through this plant?  ,2,2
MULDER: Then what happens to it?  ,2,2
MULDER: Could this thing have escaped through that outlet pipe?  ,2,2
MULDER: Guess all we can do is wait.  ,2,2
MULDER: I'm at the treatment plant. I was playing a hunch it might have gotten back into the system.  ,2,2
"MULDER: Forget it, it's stupid.  ",2,2
MULDER: Why not?  ,2,2
MULDER: You mean it's trying to reproduce?  ,2,2
MULDER: Yeah...  ,2,2
"MULDER: I know, Scully. It could multiply.  ",2,2
MULDER: Where?  ,2,2
MULDER: That's near where we found the first body.  ,2,2
MULDER: That must be where it got into the system.  ,2,2
MULDER: Let's see if we can get that gate closed.  ,2,2
MULDER: Hey!  ,2,2
MULDER: You all right?  ,2,2
MULDER: Give me your hand!  ,2,2
MULDER: We need some help down here!  ,2,2
"MULDER: No. But I should warn you, I may reek a bit out of the sewer.  ",2,2
"MULDER: Success in our work is imperative, Scully. Reinstatement of the X-Files must be undeniable.  ",2,2
MULDER: No. We have a friend in the F.B.I.  ,2,2
MULDER: Human?  ,2,2
MULDER: How does that happen?  ,2,2
MULDER: I know these. These are from Chernobyl.  ,2,2
"MULDER: You know, they say three species disappear off the planet every day. You wonder how many new ones are being created.  ",2,2
MULDER: Was this damaged during the incident?  ,2,3
MULDER: May I see the suspect?  ,2,3
MULDER: A forty-two year old real estate agent murders four strangers with his bare hands? That's not supposed to happen anywhere.  ,2,3
"MULDER: In each incident, the suspect was killed?  ",2,3
MULDER: Were autopsies conducted on the suspects for substance abuse?  ,2,3
MULDER: What's wrong with right field?  ,2,3
MULDER: Got to have an arm to play right field.  ,2,3
MULDER: I played right field.  ,2,3
MULDER: Perpetrators of mass murders are divided into two classifications... the spree killer and the serial. The sudden violent outburst in a public locale and the suspect's disregard for anonymity or survival define the Franklin incidents as spree killings.  ,2,3
MULDER: I find no evidence of this to be the case.  ,2,3
"MULDER: Uh, pardon my rubber.  ",2,3
MULDER: They are connected.  ,2,3
MULDER: Mrs. McRoberts?  ,2,3
"MULDER: This is Sheriff Spencer, and I'm Agent Fox Mulder with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  ",2,3
MULDER: You can blame me.  ,2,3
MULDER: May I speak with him?  ,2,3
MULDER: It's the day's most important meal.  ,2,3
"MULDER: Um... this invoice? It was, uh, signed by you. Did you pick up the car last night?  ",2,3
MULDER: Can you describe to me exactly how the dashboard read-out was damaged?  ,2,3
MULDER: Why?  ,2,3
MULDER: No!  ,2,3
MULDER: Imagine being one of those flies on the wall of the Oval Office.  ,2,3
"MULDER: It was a fine effort, though.  ",2,3
"MULDER: Oh, I'm sorry, boys. It arrived the same day as my subscription to ""Celebrity Skin.""  ",2,3
MULDER: She wouldn't come. She's afraid of her love for you.  ,2,3
"MULDER: You know, Frohike, it's men like you that give perversion a bad name.  ",2,3
MULDER: Why won't they release it? Is it possible it affects humans in the same way?  ,2,3
"MULDER: Hey, Frohike, can I borrow those?  ",2,3
"MULDER: I saw the chopper from two different locations. Look at my skin, feel my hair. The insecticide is still on me.  ",2,3
MULDER: Don't start with that tired crap. Don't start diverting blame.  ,2,3
"MULDER: Look, if you're the one responsible for the illegal spraying, then the sooner you take responsibility, the sooner people will stop dying. The killers all resided near heavily sprayed areas.  ",2,3
"MULDER: Yeah, well, if it's so safe, why was it done in secret?  ",2,3
MULDER: By who? Who proved it to you?  ,2,3
"MULDER: Scully, your own autopsy reported the killer had chemical anomalies.  ",2,3
MULDER: Scully. Are you familiar with subliminal messages?  ,2,3
"MULDER: No, it's a fact that some department stores use subliminal messages in their ambient music to deter shoplifting. And the Russians have been using advanced electroensephelographic techniques to control behavior.  ",2,3
MULDER: Electronic devices were destroyed by every perpetrator.  ,2,3
MULDER: The insecticide L.S.D.M. is known to invoke a fear response in cluster flies. What if the chemical causes the same reaction in humans? All the perpetrators were phobic. Taber was claustrophobic. McRoberts' husband stated she had a paranoia about rape. The insecticide heightened their already existing phobia to an unbearable level. Then the electronic devices relayed messages that told them specifically what to do with their fear in order to alleviate it. The messages were relayed purposely.  ,2,3
"MULDER: Yeah, he's probably one of those people that thinks Elvis is dead.  ",2,3
MULDER: I think this area is being subjected to a controlled experiment.  ,2,3
"MULDER: They've done it before. D.D.T. in the 50's, Agent Orange, germ warfare on unsuspecting neighborhoods.  ",2,3
"MULDER: Fear. It's the oldest tool of power. If you're distracted by fear of those around you, it keeps you from seeing the actions of those above.  ",2,3
MULDER: But?  ,2,3
MULDER: Only seven more to go.  ,2,3
MULDER: Frustrated Jehovah's witness?  ,2,3
"MULDER: Edward Funsch, age fifty-two. No diploma, no vehicle or driver's license, navy radio man, wife died ten years ago. No kids. No known family, just been laid-off.  ",2,3
MULDER: When was the blood tester here?  ,2,3
MULDER: Ten-thirty?  ,2,3
MULDER: Here it comes.  ,2,3
MULDER: Have you seen this man?  ,2,3
MULDER: Where'd you let him out?  ,2,3
MULDER: I don't think he's waiting.  ,2,3
"MULDER: Scully, anything?  ",2,3
MULDER: Get down!  ,2,3
MULDER: Put it down!  ,2,3
"MULDER: Then put it down, Ed.  ",2,3
"MULDER: I know they won't, Ed. I know they won't let you.  ",2,3
"MULDER: If you don't put it down, I'm going to have to shoot you. Or you're going to have to shoot me.  ",2,3
MULDER: It's all right.  ,2,3
MULDER: I want unrestricted access to him for questioning.  ,2,3
MULDER:  The article makes no mention of the fire.  ,2,4
MULDER:  Grissoms company had a number of government contracts which would place this investigation within the Bureaus jurisdiction.  ,2,4
MULDER:  I think that the circumstances surrounding Grissoms death warrant a closer look.  I called NYPD but they  wont even talk to me unless I get the Attorney General to sign off on it.  ,2,4
"MULDER:  My source, the only one I have ever trusted, is dead.  ",2,4
MULDER:  Yeah.  ,2,4
MULDER:  Theres a mistake here.  Theres been another agent assigned to the case.  ,2,4
MULDER:  Skinner didnt say anything about taking on a new partner.  ,2,4
MULDER:  And you all ready talked to the police?  ,2,4
MULDER:  I heard the tape.  ,2,4
MULDER:  But no trace of a fire.  ,2,4
MULDER:  That all you know?  ,2,4
"MULDER:  Listen, I appreciate the show and tell, and I dont want you to take this personally, but I work alone.  Ill straighten things out with Skinner.  ",2,4
"MULDER:  All right, Ill tell you what, I got a little work to finish up around here.  Why dont you go down to the motor pool and requisition us a car and Ill meet you down there.  ",2,4
MULDER:  Its your party.  ,2,4
MULDER:  National airport.  Catching the shuttle up to Laguardia in a half an hour.  How do you feel about joining me in the Big Apple for an autopsy.  ,2,4
MULDER:  I was hoping you could tell me.  ,2,4
MULDER:  Thats fine.  I can have the ME wrap the body to go  ,2,4
MULDER:  Youll get it by five.  ,2,4
MULDER: How many other kinds of sleep disorder did he treat?  ,2,4
MULDER:  Maintaining that kind of batting average must have taken its toll.  ,2,4
MULDER:  Did he ever show any signs of psychological stress?  ,2,4
MULDER:  But he was never delusional.  ,2,4
MULDER:  Whats his story?  ,2,4
MULDER:  How do you do that?  ,2,4
MULDER:  So its actually possible to alter somebodys dreams?  ,2,4
MULDER:  Im sorry if I hurt your feelings.  ,2,4
MULDER:  Exactly.  ,2,4
"MULDER:  Oh stop it, or youll hurt my feelings.  ",2,4
MULDER:  Yeah.  ,2,4
MULDER:  What is it?  ,2,4
MULDER:  I can make it in two hours.  ,2,4
MULDER: Spleen or pancreas?  ,2,4
"MULDER:  This is Alex Krycek.  Were, uh, working the case together.  ",2,4
MULDER:  Like fire?  ,2,4
MULDER:  Any theories?  ,2,4
MULDER:  What?  ,2,4
"MULDER:  So, why did your friend from homicide call us.  ",2,4
MULDER:  So what does the ME have to say about it?  ,2,4
MULDER:  Whats this scar right here?  ,2,4
"MULDER:  Well, unless they got to his appendix through his neck.  ",2,4
MULDER:  Willig was a Marine?  So where do all Marines receive basic training on the East coast?  ,2,4
MULDER:  Where Grissom was stationed from 1968 to 1971.  ,2,4
"MULDER:  Here we go.  Willig was assigned to Special Forces on Re-con squad J-7.  Of thirteen original members, hes one of two survivors.  ",2,4
MULDER:  This leaves us with one person who can tell us what happened on Parris Island.  ,2,4
MULDER:  We just want to ask him a few questions about his military service.  ,2,4
MULDER:  Is that why you put him in isolation?  ,2,4
MULDER:  How was he interfering?  ,2,4
"MULDER:   Excuse me, but exactly how would Cole disrupt their sleep?  ",2,4
MULDER:  Lets get Coles face onto the wire.  ,2,4
MULDER:  Mulder.  ,2,4
MULDER:  Who are you?  ,2,4
MULDER:  Why are you trying to help me?  ,2,4
MULDER:  What is this?  ,2,4
MULDER:  Of course.  Someone was conducting sleep deprivation experiments on Parris Island.  ,2,4
MULDER:  Why?  ,2,4
MULDER:  And Willig and Cole were the lab rats.  ,2,4
MULDER:  You think Coles behind whats happening now?  ,2,4
MULDER:  I thought Cole was the last.  ,2,4
MULDER:  So how do I contact you?  ,2,4
MULDER:  I may still need more.  ,2,4
MULDER:  Is he alive?  ,2,4
"MULDER:  Well, that second officer is still in a coma, so I dont think we can count on him to give us an answer.  ",2,4
"MULDER:  Well, the military all ready sent troops to radioactive mushroom clouds, I guess they figured they had to top themselves, right?  ",2,4
"MULDER:  Well, I learned something at Dr. Grissoms clinic. About what happens to a persons cortex when you stimulate it with electricity.  ",2,4
"MULDER:  Well, what if that stimulus were to come from a remote source?  What if Cole had somehow developed the ability to project his unconscious.  ",2,4
"MULDER:  Think about it, Scully.  In all those years without REM sleep, maybe Cole built a bridge between the waking world and the dream world.  A collective unconscious.  And what if, by existing consciously in the unconscious world, he developed the ability to externalize his dreams and effectively alter reality.  ",2,4
"MULDER:  All right, Ill sharpen my pencils and Ill see you later.  ",2,4
"MULDER:  Ill be right there, Krycek.  ",2,4
MULDER:  Were gonna check out another member of the squad and see if he can tell us anything about Cole.  ,2,4
MULDER:  Hes all right.  He could use a little more seasoning and some wardrobe advice But hes a lot more open to extreme possibilities then. . .  ,2,4
MULDER:  . . .then I assumed he would be.  ,2,4
"MULDER:  Oh yeah, its---its great.  Im surprised I put up with you so long.  ",2,4
MULDER:  Okay.  ,2,4
MULDER:  Salvatore Matola?  ,2,4
MULDER:  Were with the FBI.  We just want to ask you some questions.  Whyd you think we were gonna kill you?  ,2,4
MULDER:  You know about Willig and Grissom.  ,2,4
"MULDER:  Who?  Hey Sal, can you spare a few minutes?  ",2,4
MULDER:  And you never got tired?  ,2,4
MULDER:  Serotonin?  ,2,4
MULDER:  How long did this go on?  ,2,4
"MULDER:  Well, then who did you take orders from?  ",2,4
MULDER:  We suspect that Augustus Cole may be behind the murders of Willig and Grissom.  ,2,4
"MULDER:  But why Grissom.  He was never in country, he wasnt even part of the squadron.  ",2,4
MULDER:  Whos Gerardi?  ,2,4
"MULDER:  Were going after Gerardi.  Cole sees himself as a kind of avenging angel.  In his mind, everyone responsible for the atrocities, whether directly or indirectly, must be punished.  ",2,4
"MULDER:  Phu Bai was one of the bloodiest massacres of the war. Over 300 children slaughtered.  But unlike My Lai, no US troops were ever charged.  The 24th anniversary of the massacre was two days ago.  ",2,4
MULDER:  Mulder.  ,2,4
MULDER:  Do you have his number in Boston?  ,2,4
"MULDER:  Try to have a photograph waiting for us at the security desk so we know who were looking for, okay?  ",2,4
"MULDER:  Stay here, Ill cover you on the side.  ",2,4
MULDER:  Federal Agent!  Drop your weapon.  ,2,4
MULDER:  Gerardi!  Where is he?  ,2,4
MULDER:  I saw him.  ,2,4
"MULDER:  No, Gerardi was here, and so was Cole.  We just missed them.  ",2,4
"MULDER:  Okay, theres nothing here.  Start with a small window of time, say 1935 to 1945.  If you dont find anything in that time frame, then open it up one minute at a time.  With all these cameras, we should be able to see something.  ",2,4
MULDER:  Whats the problem.  ,2,4
"MULDER:  I told you, I thought I saw Gerardi.  ",2,4
"MULDER:  All right, what do you want to know.  ",2,4
MULDER:  Its just that my ideas usually arent very popular.  ,2,4
MULDER: I think that Cole possesses the psychic ability to manipulate sounds and images to generate illusions that are so convincing they can kill.  Hows that for a theory.  ,2,4
MULDER:  Yeah.  ,2,4
MULDER:  Where is this.  ,2,4
MULDER:  Hes still alive.  Put pressure on the wound on the back of his neck and radio for help.  NOW!  ,2,4
"MULDER:  Step away from the edge.  Corporal Cole, Im a federal agent,  now please, step back.  ",2,4
"MULDER:  Thats not why Im here.  Im putting down my gun. I just want to talk to you for a few minutes, after that, youre free to do whatever you want.  ",2,4
MULDER:  I know.  ,2,4
MULDER: One minute is all Im asking.  ,2,4
"MULDER:  What the military did to you was wrong, but your testimony can help.  ",2,4
"MULDER:   Krycek put down the gun and get out of here. Krycek, I said put down the gun and get out of here!  ",2,4
MULDER:  NO!!!!!!  ,2,4
MULDER:  You did the right thing.  ,2,4
MULDER:  Someone went through a lot of trouble stealing both our copies to keep this a secret.  ,2,4
MULDER:  He said its never been more dangerous.  ,2,4
"MULDER:  No, the man who leaked us the report.  The one whos been helping us.  ",2,4
MULDER:  He said that closing down the X-Files was just the beginning. That weve never been in greater danger.  ,2,4
"MULDER: Krycek, what's up?  ",2,5
MULDER: What kind of situation?  ,2,5
MULDER: And they want me?  ,2,5
MULDER: What for?  ,2,5
MULDER: Yeah.  ,2,5
MULDER: This is Agent Krycek.  ,2,5
MULDER: What does he want?  ,2,5
MULDER: Passage to where?  ,2,5
MULDER: Is he lucid?  ,2,5
MULDER: Like what?  ,2,5
"MULDER: Yeah, yeah, but I've never been in a hostage negotiation before.  ",2,5
MULDER: Do we know anything about his abduction experiences?  ,2,5
MULDER: Is that a problem?  ,2,5
"MULDER: If this man is an abductee, I need to know more about him, his personal history. Each abduction case is different.  ",2,5
MULDER: And nobody's thought to call the hospital for records?  ,2,5
MULDER: Duane?  ,2,5
MULDER: This is Special Agent Fox Mulder.  ,2,5
"MULDER: I think I know what you're going through, Duane. I just want to make sure you get what you want and that...  ",2,5
"MULDER: I know you're scared, Duane, and that you'd like to see this all come out right.  ",2,5
"MULDER: We're only concerned about your safety, Duane. You and the others.  ",2,5
"MULDER: You need someone to trust, Duane.  ",2,5
"MULDER: Nobody's going to try anything, Duane.  ",2,5
MULDER: And you didn't think to mention that?  ,2,5
"MULDER: The point being that the bureau wants to minimize it's embarrassment, isn't that it? That we can police our own.  ",2,5
"MULDER: Well, you're off to a hell of a start.  ",2,5
"MULDER: Well, if you just wanted somebody to come down and read the script, you didn't have to bring me out.  ",2,5
"MULDER: No, no, that man is afraid. And the only way you're going to win his trust is by trying to understand what he's afraid of.  ",2,5
"MULDER: Well, then understand that you might have to alter your approach a little bit here.  ",2,5
MULDER: It's me. I'm in Virginia.  ,2,5
MULDER: What's the media saying?  ,2,5
"MULDER: Well, what they're not telling you is that he's former F.B.I. who also claims to be an alien abductee.  ",2,5
"MULDER: Yeah, his name's Duane Barry. Look, Scully, I need your help.  ",2,5
MULDER: The lights just went out here.  ,2,5
MULDER: What's the number there?  ,2,5
MULDER: Duane?  ,2,5
"MULDER: Is everybody all right, Duane?  ",2,5
"MULDER: No, I, I believe you. I just need to know if...  ",2,5
MULDER: Yeah.  ,2,5
MULDER: Don't jump into his delusion. I can't negotiate with him if he thinks I believe him.  ,2,5
MULDER: Duane?  ,2,5
MULDER: We're unarmed.  ,2,5
MULDER: No.  ,2,5
MULDER: No. We're just here to help.  ,2,5
"MULDER: Nobody's going to try anything, Duane.  ",2,5
MULDER: We just want to make sure no one else gets hurt.  ,2,5
"MULDER: They want to work with you, Duane, but you got to work with them. Why not let the others go?  ",2,5
MULDER: Then let the women go.  ,2,5
"MULDER: Well, we lost time. I checked my watch. Isn't that what happens? Time stops. Isn't it?  ",2,5
"MULDER: Isn't that what they've been saying to you, Duane? That you're making it up?  ",2,5
"MULDER: I hear you, Duane.  ",2,5
MULDER: No. I believe your story.  ,2,5
MULDER: I know you're afraid. I know the pain and the fear you must feel.  ,2,5
"MULDER: I've talked to people, Duane. People just like you, and nobody wanted to believe.  ",2,5
"MULDER: Why don't you let him go, Duane? There's no reason this man has to die. Come on, Duane. You've got the power. Let him go.  ",2,5
"MULDER: Good. You made the right choice. Now, we're just going to move him carefully to the door.  ",2,5
"MULDER: I'm telling the truth, Duane.  ",2,5
MULDER: It happened to my sister.  ,2,5
"MULDER: How does it happen, Duane? Driving in your car? Alone in bed at night? When do they come to you? You're paralyzed, aren't you? Unable to move. Sometimes, you can't even breathe. You feel an electric shock go through your body...  ",2,5
"MULDER: There are beings, aren't there, Duane? Are they tall or small?  ",2,5
MULDER: Diminutive...  ,2,5
"MULDER: You're powerless. Sometimes, you can't even speak. It's always the same, nobody can help you. Where do they take you, Duane? Is there a ship? Do they take you to a ship, Duane? How do you get there? Are you conscious or being transported?  ",2,5
"MULDER: That's right. Abductees call it ""mindscan."" It's a kind of telepathy.  ",2,5
MULDER: They take you aboard the ship to perform the tests.  ,2,5
MULDER: She was eight.  ,2,5
MULDER: What are they doing to them?  ,2,5
MULDER: Are they hurting them?  ,2,5
"MULDER: You can let the others go, Duane. Let the others go and take me.  ",2,5
"MULDER: I don't care about that, Duane.  ",2,5
MULDER: Who in the government?  ,2,5
"MULDER: You're going to have to deal with resolving this situation, Duane... sooner or later.  ",2,5
MULDER: There's no other way out. You've got to tell them what you want to do.  ,2,5
MULDER: What place?  ,2,5
MULDER: Where is that?  ,2,5
MULDER: How do they find you each time?  ,2,5
"MULDER: Why not let the women go, Duane? They'll deal with you if you let the women go.  ",2,5
"MULDER: The women are of no consequence to you. Let them go. It's the right thing to do, Duane.  ",2,5
"MULDER: What do you want, Duane? A car?  ",2,5
MULDER: Do you know where you want to go?  ,2,5
"MULDER: Duane, you can't leave here if you don't know where you want to go.  ",2,5
MULDER: Come here.  ,2,5
MULDER: There... there's something I want to ask you.  ,2,5
"MULDER: You didn't believe me. I had to earn your trust. Now, there's something I got to know. Are you making any of this up?  ",2,5
MULDER: No...  ,2,5
"MULDER: No, I don't. I'm sorry.  ",2,5
"MULDER: Duane, will you listen to me for a second?  ",2,5
MULDER: Duane...  ,2,5
"MULDER: Duane, I do believe you.  ",2,5
MULDER: I believe you!  ,2,5
"MULDER: No! I believe you, Duane!  ",2,5
"MULDER: Can I say... can I say something? Duane, can I say something? I know you're tired, but there's something you've forgotten to do. When you let the women leave, you left the door unlocked. Go lock the door, Duane. Go lock the door. Go lock the door, Duane. Go lock it. They could get in here. Go lock the door.  ",2,5
MULDER: Yeah.  ,2,5
"MULDER: It's just that, uh... I believed him.  ",2,5
"MULDER: No, I was surprised to get your call.  ",2,5
"MULDER: I don't know, I guess I thought maybe you called me down here to chew me out.  ",2,5
MULDER: The fine thread of sanity.  ,2,5
"MULDER: It was right where he said it would be, Scully. Along with the ones in his gums and sinus.  ",2,5
"MULDER: Well, if it was, that would mean Duane Barry is telling the truth.  ",2,5
"MULDER ON MACHINE: Hello, this is Fox Mulder. Leave a message please.  ",2,5
MULDER: Mrs. Scully?  ,2,6
MULDER: There's a question of how he could've gotten to her in the first place.  ,2,6
"MULDER: Agent Scully was carrying a small piece of metal that was removed from Duane Barry's abdomen, an implant he described as a tracking device.  ",2,6
"MULDER: Yes, but that still doesn't explain how he could have found her.  ",2,6
MULDER: I don't know. He talked about a mountain but he wasn't specific about the location.  ,2,6
MULDER: I'd like to brief them myself...  ,2,6
"MULDER: Sir, I know Duane Barry. I've been in his head, I know how he thinks...  ",2,6
MULDER: Sir...  ,2,6
MULDER: Right there.  ,2,6
MULDER: Back it up a few frames.  ,2,6
MULDER: She's still alive. Print this up.  ,2,6
MULDER ON RECORDING: What place?  ,2,6
MULDER ON RECORDING: Where is that?  ,2,6
MULDER: Yeah.  ,2,6
MULDER: I didn't.  ,2,6
MULDER: Where was that patrolman killed again?  ,2,6
MULDER: Doesn't Route 229 lead to the Blue Ridge Parkway?  ,2,6
MULDER: Ascend to the stars. Skyland Mountain.  ,2,6
MULDER: Get your car and meet me downstairs.  ,2,6
MULDER: Just get your car.  ,2,6
MULDER: I'll deal with Skinner.  ,2,6
"MULDER: Come on, let's go.  ",2,6
MULDER: I'm fine.  ,2,6
"MULDER: No, I said I'm fine.  ",2,6
MULDER: Did they estimate how many people are put to sleep listening to their statistics?  ,2,6
"MULDER: Look, I know you think we should have told Skinner but if he sends in the whole cavalry, Duane Barry might go over the edge.  ",2,6
"MULDER: If we find him first, we'll notify the Bureau. All right?  ",2,6
"MULDER: Well, that's the easiest explanation. It's also the most implausible.  ",2,6
MULDER: Somebody could have given him her address. I don't know who.  ,2,6
MULDER: Did he have a woman with him?  ,2,6
MULDER: You gotta get me up there.  ,2,6
MULDER: I don't have the time.  ,2,6
"MULDER: No, you don't have a choice.  ",2,6
"MULDER: Stay here and whatever happens, don't let him stop the tram.  ",2,6
MULDER: Go ahead.  ,2,6
MULDER: You're breaking up.  ,2,6
"MULDER: What are you doing? Turn it back on. Krycek, what's happening down there?  ",2,6
MULDER: Is there an emergency system on-board? Can you read me down there? Can anyone read me?  ,2,6
MULDER: Federal agent!  ,2,6
MULDER: Freeze!  ,2,6
MULDER: I said freeze! Where is she?  ,2,6
MULDER: Don't move.  ,2,6
MULDER: Where is she? Where'd you leave her?  ,2,6
MULDER: Who?  ,2,6
MULDER: Now what happened after you took her out of the trunk?  ,2,6
MULDER: Then where'd you take her?  ,2,6
MULDER: (quietly) Did you kill her?  ,2,6
MULDER: How'd you get this?  ,2,6
MULDER: What ship?  ,2,6
MULDER: I saw a helicopter.  ,2,6
"MULDER: Sit down, Duane.  ",2,6
"MULDER: Duane, settle down!  ",2,6
MULDER: Did you hurt her?  ,2,6
MULDER: Did you hurt her!?  ,2,6
MULDER: What is this?  ,2,6
MULDER: Yeah.  ,2,6
"MULDER: No, he's giving me nothing. Were you out here alone?  ",2,6
MULDER: Nobody goes in or out of that room.  ,2,6
MULDER: What are you doing in there?  ,2,6
MULDER: Come here.  ,2,6
MULDER: No one...  ,2,6
MULDER: No one!  ,2,6
MULDER: No one is to interrogate the suspect.  ,2,6
MULDER: Except me. Did you ask him about Scully?  ,2,6
MULDER: What'd he say?  ,2,6
"MULDER: Yes, sir.  ",2,6
MULDER: What happened?  ,2,6
MULDER: Duane? Duane?  ,2,6
MULDER: I'm Agent Mulder. I'd like a copy of this man's autopsy report.  ,2,6
MULDER: Are you the pathologist?  ,2,6
MULDER: Can I ask what your preliminary findings are?  ,2,6
MULDER: You haven't run a toxicological yet?  ,2,6
MULDER: I'd be interested to see what you find. When will they be on file?  ,2,6
"MULDER: I'd like a copy as soon as possible, please.  ",2,6
"MULDER: What do you mean, ""military?"" You're not F.B.I.?  ",2,6
"MULDER: I didn't kill him, if that's what you're suggesting.  ",2,6
MULDER: I was interrogating him about Agent Scully. He wasn't cooperating so I pushed him.  ,2,6
"MULDER: Momentarily. But then I left the room. He was very much alive, I spoke to him. Agent Krycek spoke to him.  ",2,6
MULDER: Is Agent Krycek asserting that I killed him too?  ,2,6
MULDER: There is another plausible cause of death.  ,2,6
MULDER: Poisoning by injection or ingestion.  ,2,6
MULDER: You won't find that on the navy pathologist's report.  ,2,6
MULDER: That the autopsy is incomplete. That the military covered up the toxicological findings.  ,2,6
MULDER: Because they know where Scully is.  ,2,6
"MULDER: Oh, I don't know. Maybe it's because I find it hard to trust anybody.  ",2,6
"MULDER: Alex? Alex, can I borrow your car keys?  ",2,6
MULDER: There's someone I've got to see.  ,2,6
"MULDER: I know, just give me the car keys please.  ",2,6
MULDER: What?  ,2,6
MULDER: Why? Do they have something on him?  ,2,6
MULDER: I need his help.  ,2,6
MULDER: Your predecessor could have helped me.  ,2,6
MULDER: I want an answer!  ,2,6
MULDER: You mean the government?  ,2,6
MULDER: So long as it's true.  ,2,6
MULDER: It goes on.  ,2,6
"MULDER: Yes, sir.  ",2,6
"MULDER: I found this in Agent Krycek's car. He doesn't smoke. Agent Krycek was the last person with Duane Barry before he died. He was also the last person to see the tram operator before he disappeared. When I got to the top of Skyline Mountain, I saw an unmarked helicopter working the area. I believe that Agent Krycek gave away the whereabouts of Duane Barry and Agent Scully to whoever he's working with.  ",2,6
"MULDER: I don't know, the military? Some covert organization within the government? Whoever it is that man who smokes those cigarettes works for.  ",2,6
"MULDER: Because Agent Scully got too close to whatever it is they're trying to deny. Because she had hard and damning evidence, that metallic implant in her possession. Or because her termination would prevent further involvement with me and my work.  ",2,6
MULDER: I don't know. How far do you think they'd go?  ,2,6
"MULDER: That's it? He's gone, he just disappears into the woodwork?  ",2,6
MULDER: Who are these people who can just murder with impunity and we can't do anything about it?  ,2,6
MULDER: Like hell.  ,2,6
MULDER: What can you do about it?  ,2,6
MULDER: I'm sorry I don't have better news.  ,2,6
MULDER: We don't know anything more about her.  ,2,6
MULDER: It's probably scarier when you stop having the dream. Don't you think?  ,2,6
MULDER: Don't you want to keep it?  ,2,6
MULDER: (showing badge) Agent Mulder. Im with the Bureau.  ,2,7
MULDER: They should have.  ,2,7
"MULDER: (walking toward house) Theres no time for agency rivalries. I dont care about credit for the arrest or what goes on whose record. In the past year these killers have murdered six people in two states. They only kill at night. By the end of the week, two more people will be dead and they will be gone.  ",2,7
MULDER: Theres a file on the previous murders. Ive studied it. Ive studied them. Ive been waiting three months for them to reappear.  ,2,7
"MULDER: The wire reported a body was found drained of blood, bite marks on the exterior jugular and median cubital veins. Every mirror in the house was smashed.  ",2,7
MULDER: Theres writings on the wall written in the victims blood.  ,2,7
"MULDER: ""He who eats of my flesh and drinks of my blood shall have eternal life and I will raise him up on the last day."" They have the same feeble grasp of the Bible as all those big-haired preachers do. The victim  was he a father?  ",2,7
"MULDER: In Memphis, they murdered James Ellis, 58, father of Ellis and Sons Clothiers. The second victim was a Korean woman -- Linda Sun. The third victim was a Jesuit Theologian. Excuse me. (MULDER has taken off his jacket and put on latex gloves and is kneeling down beside the overflow trap of the hot tub) In Portland, three months ago the first victim was a priest. The second victim was the only son of a family of six children. The last victim was the owner of a new age book shop --- The Holy Spirit. (feels around in trap) I believe thats how they perceive themselves, as a kind of Unholy Trinity. (pulls a used needle out of the trap) They use these to extract blood and store it for a quick fix later. Their need is insatiable, but murdering for blood risks exposure and capture. If my profile of the previous cases holds true, theyve been living in the city and working near blood products for the past month.  ",2,7
MULDER: Im working alone. (turns and begins walking away)  ,2,7
MULDER: I only need one thing.  ,2,7
"MULDER: (on phone) Yeah, hi. This is Marty Mulder from your payroll service. I have a question regarding the W -4 form of a recent employee.  ",2,7
MULDER: (on phone) When was he hired?  ,2,7
MULDER: Federal Agent!  ,2,7
MULDER: Federal Agent! Freeze!  ,2,7
MULDER: That better?  ,2,7
MULDER: What are you?  ,2,7
MULDER: And the three of you killed Garret Lore.  ,2,7
MULDER: Your fingerprints were found at the crime scene.  ,2,7
MULDER: Frogs eat flies. Are you dead?  ,2,7
MULDER: Do you believe that?  ,2,7
"MULDER: (considers) Well, not if drawstring pants come back into style.  ",2,7
"MULDER: Its a stiff price, though. Look at yourself  drinking blood, living in darkness, unable to see your reflection in a mirror. Or is that just a myth?  ",2,7
MULDER: Its more likely Ill be looking in your eyes at the moment before they lead you into the gas chamber. Thats a moment you wont have to face if you tell me where the others are.  ,2,7
"MULDER: Well, if you are what you say you are, I know what can kill you.  ",2,7
"MULDER: Itd be easy to cover those windows. Just tell me where the other two are. In another couple of hours, therell be no escaping the sun. Son.  ",2,7
"MULDER: If he wants to talk, cover the windows and call me. (hands him the foil)  ",2,7
"MULDER: That man is clearly delusional but I get the sense that not even he believes his claims. For now, weve got to play along with his beliefs. Im hoping the sunlight will give him an excuse to talk.  ",2,7
MULDER: I didnt check into a hotel room. I dont sleep anymore. (smiles bitterly and leaves)  ,2,7
MULDER: The guards found no flammable materials? I had believed that this mans illness was psychological.  ,2,7
"MULDER: Im familiar with porphyria. Its an affliction which causes lesions and blisters when skin is exposed to sunlight, not fourth degree burns. Sufferers may have a hema deficiency which can be supplemented by a small ingestion of blood, not the kind of bloodthirst this man had. Its probably ignorance of porphyria as a disease that led to the creation of vampire myths in Asia in the Middle Ages. I had dismissed the possibility of the actual existence of such a creature as myth.  ",2,7
MULDER: When will you get the blood tests back?  ,2,7
"MULDER: (pointing to JOHN, THE SONs hand) Whats this purple stain here?  ",2,7
MULDER: Can you read it?  ,2,7
MULDER: I can make a quarter appear from behind your ear.  ,2,7
MULDER: (sitting) How do you define normal?  ,2,7
"MULDER: I dont. All I know is, uh .. normal is not what I feel.  ",2,7
MULDER: He who drinks my blood  ,2,7
MULDER: How do you know?  ,2,7
MULDER: I need to know.  ,2,7
MULDER: (pulling her hand away from his mouth) AIDS. Arent you afraid?  ,2,7
MULDER: (to himself) Father. The Sun.  ,2,7
"MULDER: (quietly) I dont want to bias your report, but I need a preliminary examination for anything  unnatural.  ",2,7
MULDER: Check these prints immediately. One will be the victims. The other should be the woman were looking for.  ,2,7
MULDER looks at the files of the murders that were committed in each of those cities.)  ,2,7
MULDER: The Unholy Spirit.  ,2,7
MULDER: Has blood in it.  ,2,7
"MULDER: (with conviction) Shes gone, and shes not coming back.  ",2,7
MULDER: Special Agent Fox Mulder. (shows badge) Federal Bureau of Investigation. Theyre after you.  ,2,7
MULDER: The bread. Legends in Eastern European countries. Its said that one can protect oneself eating bread filled with blood. You were protecting yourself.  ,2,7
MULDER: I think its best if I took you into protective custody. Theyll kill once more. Theyll try to kill you.  ,2,7
MULDER: What I believe you to be.  ,2,7
MULDER: (moving toward her) You were in Memphis and Portland when the other murders occurred. How are you connected?  ,2,7
MULDER: But they followed you. They want you.  ,2,7
MULDER: Thats from someone I lost.  ,2,7
"MULDER: The one you lost, John, hes  dead. But theyve picked up another. Theyre three again. Kristen, youll be safer if you come back to the police station with me.  ",2,7
MULDER: Then I wont go.  ,2,7
MULDER: Yeah?  ,2,7
MULDER: No mirrors.  ,2,7
MULDER: That makes this hard.  ,2,7
MULDER: Its not who you are. It doesnt make you happy.  ,2,7
MULDER: (sitting up suddenly) Are they here?  ,2,7
MULDER: (putting on his shoes) My cars down the hill.  ,2,7
MULDER: You have to get your things.  ,2,7
MULDER: Come on.  ,2,7
MULDER: (running to KRISTEN) Are you all right?  ,2,7
MULDER: Ill go.  ,2,7
MULDER: The remains?  ,2,7
"MULDER: Its too soon, Mrs. Scully. We cant give up.  ",2,8
MULDER: Who...?  ,2,8
MULDER: (shouting) How did she get here?  ,2,8
MULDER: Is that Daly?  ,2,8
"MULDER: Was it, was it paramedics, FBI, military? Answer me right now!  ",2,8
"MULDER: What, youre telling me she just appeared?  ",2,8
MULDER: Who did this to her!?  ,2,8
MULDER: I want to see her admission forms. Who did this to her? I want to see what tests have been done!  ,2,8
MULDER: Id like her examined for trace evidence.  ,2,8
MULDER: (to Mrs. Scully) She doesnt want to live in this condition.  ,2,8
MULDER: By who?  ,2,8
"MULDER: Dana talked to you just now? If she talked, the EEG would have moved.  ",2,8
MULDER: Youre Scullys sister.  ,2,8
MULDER: Shes not here.  ,2,8
MULDER: I need to do more than just wave my hands in the air.  ,2,8
MULDER: Frohike?  ,2,8
MULDER: Theres plenty of room down there.  ,2,8
MULDER: Im doing my laundry.  ,2,8
MULDER: What?  ,2,8
MULDER: Branched DNA?  ,2,8
MULDER: Whats it used for?  ,2,8
MULDER: You mean a high-tech identity card?  ,2,8
MULDER: Will she live?  ,2,8
MULDER: Hey!  ,2,8
"MULDER: There was a man, he took Scullys blood.  ",2,8
MULDER: Get that gun out of my face...  ,2,8
MULDER: You ignore my call for help and then you expect me to do what you say? You go to hell!  ,2,8
MULDER: What the hell are you talking about?  ,2,8
MULDER: I owe her more than just sitting around doing nothing.  ,2,8
MULDER: Shes not dead.  ,2,8
"MULDER: Okay, then tell me. Tell me!  ",2,8
MULDER: Federal agent!  ,2,8
MULDER: Wait!  ,2,8
MULDER: Its possible branched DNA can be treated with designer antibiotics.  ,2,8
MULDER: Youve never provided an answer as to why shes here or whats wrong with her. We need to study her.  ,2,8
MULDER: Shes here because of unnatural circumstances.  ,2,8
MULDER: Thats very politically correct.  ,2,8
MULDER: Is this about the tooth that was found in the cafeteria jello?  ,2,8
"MULDER: No, sir.  ",2,8
MULDER: I was with Scully.  ,2,8
MULDER: May I see the police report?  ,2,8
"MULDER: Since I am unfamiliar with any such incident, sir, no, how would I know that?  ",2,8
"MULDER: Hows it feel? Constant denial of everything, questions answered with a question.  ",2,8
MULDER: Him. Thats what happened.  ,2,8
MULDER: Its a rumor. Who is he?  ,2,8
"MULDER: Oh, you can have it all, you can have my badge, you can have the X-Files, just tell me where he is.  ",2,8
MULDER: Thats what I want.  ,2,8
MULDER: What if I... I knew the potential consequences but I... I never told her?  ,2,8
MULDER: Including myself?  ,2,8
"MULDER: No. Sorry, I dont.  ",2,8
MULDER: Sit down!  ,2,8
"MULDER: Shut up! Tonight, I ask the questions! Youre going to answer me, you son of a bitch!  ",2,8
MULDER: Why her? Why her and not me?  ,2,8
MULDER: You should be the one to die.  ,2,8
MULDER: (almost whispering) Right? Who are you to decide whats right?  ,2,8
"MULDER: At least back then, it wasnt just wasted space.  ",2,8
"MULDER: All the forensics, the field investigations, the eyewitness accounts... to still know nothing. To lose myself... and Scully. I hate what Ive become.  ",2,8
MULDER: You.  ,2,8
MULDER: But we barely know each other.  ,2,8
MULDER: How?  ,2,8
MULDER: Waiting.  ,2,8
MULDER: Because the lights arent on.  ,2,8
"MULDER: No, I cant.  ",2,8
"MULDER: Yeah, I would. I cant, not right now.  ",2,8
"MULDER: Enough with the harmonic convergence crap, okay? Youre not saying anything to me.  ",2,8
"MULDER: I feel, Scully... that you believe... youre not ready to go. And youve always had the strength of your beliefs. I dont know if my being here... will help bring you back. But Im here.  ",2,8
"MULDER ON ANSWERING MACHINE: Hello, this is Fox Mulder. Leave a message...  ",2,8
MULDER: Im here.  ,2,8
MULDER: How you feeling?  ,2,8
MULDER: Doesnt... doesnt matter.  ,2,8
"MULDER: I know you want to get some rest, I... just came by to see... how you were doing and say hi.  ",2,8
MULDER: I was holding this for you.  ,2,8
MULDER: It's no mean claim.  ,2,9
MULDER: And you think his luck just ran out?  ,2,9
MULDER: Whoa! What the hell is that?  ,2,9
MULDER: Why weren't you up there?  ,2,9
MULDER: Do you think he's responsible for what happened?  ,2,9
MULDER: (smiling) We're not exactly proper channels.  ,2,9
MULDER: (softly) Scully? I don't think it's a good idea for you to go.  ,2,9
"MULDER: Well, maybe you should take some time off.  ",2,9
MULDER: We'll look around out here after we've checked inside.  ,2,9
MULDER: Hello?  ,2,9
MULDER: Looks like somebody wanted to put this operation permanently out of commission.  ,2,9
MULDER: He just about took my head off!  ,2,9
"MULDER: Well, who the hell are you?  ",2,9
MULDER: You always greet people this way?  ,2,9
"MULDER: Well, who did you think I was that you thought you had to protect yourself?  ",2,9
"MULDER: No, we're with the FBI.  ",2,9
MULDER: After we've investigated what happened here.  ,2,9
MULDER: Did he kill Erikson?  ,2,9
MULDER: (coming out of the office with some papers) Are these his notes?  ,2,9
MULDER: Scully? What do you make of Mr. Trepkos' neighborhood?  ,2,9
"MULDER: Don't you think their behavior is a little bizarre, almost paranoid?  ",2,9
MULDER: They're practically climbing the walls in there.  ,2,9
"MULDER: No, there's more than that ... something they're not telling us.  ",2,9
MULDER: Based on when Ludwig tried to play tee-ball with my head. He knew I wasn't Trepkos.  ,2,9
MULDER: Pierce knows these people. Let's find out what he thinks.  ,2,9
"MULDER: (to Ludwig and Tanaka, who are lifting the body) Let me help you.  ",2,9
"MULDER: We can't leave, Scully. Not yet.  ",2,9
MULDER: Trepkos is still out there.  ,2,9
"MULDER: I've been going over Trepkos' work, fragments mostly but I found several references to a subterranean organism.  ",2,9
"MULDER: An unknown organism, existing within the volcano. I haven't found anything yet that describes it in specific terms but ...  ",2,9
MULDER: (motioning to the paper) What does this say?  ,2,9
MULDER: Doesn't that suggest a silicon-based life form?  ,2,9
"MULDER: Yes, but silicon is the closest element to carbon. It reacts almost identically with other elements, the way it combines to form complex molecules. A silicon-based lifeform in the deep biosphere has been one of the Holy Grails of modern science and maybe Trepkos found it.  ",2,9
MULDER: Trepkos said he had physical evidence. It's got to be around here somewhere.  ,2,9
MULDER: Maybe it wasn't Trepkos who destroyed it. What if it was one of the others?  ,2,9
MULDER: What caused that tremor?  ,2,9
MULDER: (to Tanaka) You feeling all right?  ,2,9
"MULDER: You know, Agent Scully is a medical doctor. You should let her take a look at you.  ",2,9
MULDER: Why don't you just let her take a look ...  ,2,9
MULDER: I'll go get Scully.  ,2,9
MULDER: He just collapsed after the tremor. He seems pretty bad.  ,2,9
MULDER: What is it?  ,2,9
MULDER: What about Trepkos? We can't just leave him.  ,2,9
MULDER: (to Ludwig) Got him?  ,2,9
MULDER: Tanaka!  ,2,9
MULDER: Don't go down there!  ,2,9
MULDER: Don't go down there!  ,2,9
"MULDER: So what is it, Scully? What are we dealing with?  ",2,9
MULDER: I'll take any theory you've got.  ,2,9
MULDER: Anything you recognize?  ,2,9
MULDER: What am I looking at here?  ,2,9
MULDER: That would account for the sand in his lungs.  ,2,9
"MULDER: Silicon dioxide, the waste product of a silicon-based organism.  ",2,9
"MULDER: Come on, Scully, how else do you explain the sand in his lungs - the best trace evidence we could ask for. Trepkos was right.  ",2,9
MULDER: He discovered the spore in the samples Firewalker brought up.  ,2,9
MULDER: Not if what he discovered was too disturbing even for him to understand.  ,2,9
"MULDER: (to radio) Search and Rescue, this is Agent Mulder. Do you copy?  ",2,9
MULDER: (to radio) Please notify FBI District Headquarters in Spokane that our party is quarantining itself due to possible contagion. Have CDC set up an evacuation unit on high alert.  ,2,9
MULDER: (to radio) Tell them it's a biological agent ... of unknown origin.  ,2,9
MULDER: I'm going to go find Trepkos.  ,2,9
MULDER: Then he'll have a tough time answering my questions. I've got to find out what he knows. What he's found could change everything we understand about the origin and evolution of life.  ,2,9
MULDER: Then I have to find out why.  ,2,9
"MULDER: (quickly, shaking his head) No.  ",2,9
"MULDER: You have to finish the autopsy on Tanaka. Hopefully, that will give us a better idea of what we're dealing with, whatever it is. (Mulder moves closer and puts a hand on Scully's shoulder) I'm counting on you to keep us all from ending up on that slab.  ",2,9
MULDER: (to Ludwig) I could use a little help.  ,2,9
"MULDER: Directions, contour map, USGS survey, anything that can help me get here.  ",2,9
MULDER: Firewalker. They were transmitted right before Trepkos destroyed its camera.  ,2,9
"MULDER: Well, how will I find them?  ",2,9
MULDER: (smiling distrustingly) A guide.  ,2,9
"MULDER: Well, why are you so eager to help me find him?  ",2,9
"MULDER: Whatever I'm smelling, is it toxic?  ",2,9
MULDER: How far does the cave extend?  ,2,9
"MULDER: Why are you doing this, Trepkos? He's already dead. How many times do you have to kill him?  ",2,9
"MULDER: What went wrong, Trepkos? Firewalker carried something back to the surface.  ",2,9
MULDER: What about you? What do you say it is?  ,2,9
MULDER: Like the spore?  ,2,9
MULDER: I'm Special Agent Mulder. I'm with the FBI.  ,2,9
MULDER: I came down here to investigate Erikson's death.  ,2,9
MULDER: I just want to know what happened after the first descent. What did you find?  ,2,9
MULDER: Erikson released the spore?  ,2,9
MULDER: What about Erikson? If he was infected ...  ,2,9
MULDER: What do you mean?  ,2,9
MULDER: But you weren't infected?  ,2,9
"MULDER: You destroyed your work, the transmitting equipment, you killed Pierce so no one could leave.  ",2,9
MULDER: What about O'Neil?  ,2,9
MULDER: Was she exposed to the spore?  ,2,9
MULDER: I have a colleague - a friend - who's with O'Neil right now. Let me go to her.  ,2,9
MULDER: Then you're going to have to shoot me. Because I'm walking out of here.  ,2,9
MULDER: (in the distance) Scully!  ,2,9
MULDER: Scully!  ,2,9
MULDER: Are you all right?  ,2,9
"MULDER: Erikson was the original host. When the fungus shed its spores, everyone was at ground zero except for Trepkos.  ",2,9
"MULDER: (to radio) Search and Rescue, this is Agent Mulder. Do you copy?  ",2,9
"MULDER: (to radio) We have two survivors, Agent Scully and myself.  ",2,9
"MULDER: It's all over, Scully. He won't talk.  ",2,9
"MULDER: (voice-over) Scully and I are in the third day of a month-long quarantine, undergoing level 4 decon procedures. We are so far without symptoms of fungal contamination. All our specimens and field notes were confiscated by the military biohazard corps prior to our evacuation. Their presence has delayed for an indefinite period the arrival of the USGS data retrieval team. I suspect, though, that there will be little left for them to retrieve. There are no plans at present to explore further any of the hundreds of volcanically active mountains in the Cascade Range, including Mount Avalon. All access points to that volcano have been sealed off by army engineers.  ",2,9
"MULDER: (voice-over, continued) Of the members of the Firewalker descent team, only Trepkos and O'Neil remain unaccounted for. They are presumed dead, and the search for them has been abandoned. Firewalker, however, was recovered, though its sensory and locomotive systems were found to be irreparably damaged. The data it collected from the earth's interior will never be known. And of the events that occurred at Mount Avalon between the 11th and 13th of November, 1994, mine stands as the only record.  ",2,9

MULDER: The victim received a phone call and left his home. He was discovered in the woods in his underwear twelve hours later. He's been unable to give a coherent statement.  ,2,10
MULDER: No.  ,2,10
MULDER: The other victims have had to be sedated and hospitalized since their ordeals. They were reportedly hysterical with fear.  ,2,10
"MULDER: One in eastern Wisconsin, one three towns away.  ",2,10
"MULDER: The local sheriff in Delta Glen, Wisconsin thinks he knows what's been happening to these kids.  ",2,10
MULDER: He thinks they've been possessed.  ,2,10
MULDER: Probably went over big with the local ranchers.  ,2,10
MULDER: They're walk-ins.  ,2,10
"MULDER: They're believers in soul transference, enlightened spirits who have taken possession of other peoples bodies.  ",2,10
MULDER: Which parts are those?  ,2,10
"MULDER: When you say spirit, Gary, I'm not sure what you mean.  ",2,10
MULDER: And you don't remember who called you?  ,2,10
MULDER: Do you have any reason to believe that they may be involved with what happened to you?  ,2,10
"MULDER: Scully, we'll meet you outside.  ",2,10
MULDER: Has this boy ever been in any trouble?  ,2,10
MULDER: Yeah.  ,2,10
MULDER: You see a noticeable difference in him?  ,2,10
MULDER: The Red Museum... how are they treated by the local citizens?  ,2,10
"MULDER: Well, are they ever singled out? Shop owners refusing to sell to them, stuff like that?  ",2,10
"MULDER: Uh, can you recommend a good motel in the area?  ",2,10
"MULDER: Well, I, I want to run a background check on the church and this guy  ",2,10
"MULDER: Well, it, it's kind of a new age religion based on an old idea. That if you, uh, lose hope or despair and want to leave this mortal coil, you become open and vulnerable.  ",2,10
"MULDER: A new enlightened spirit. According to the literature, Abe Lincoln was a walk-in. And Mikhail Gorbachev and Charles Colson, Nixon's advisor.  ",2,10
MULDER: No. Not even they want to claim Nixon.  ,2,10
MULDER: I don't know. In the absence of any other plausible explanation... it's a novel theory.  ,2,10
MULDER: Really?  ,2,10
MULDER: I think the sperm posse just rode into town.  ,2,10
"MULDER: Hey, leave him alone!  ",2,10
MULDER: You got a problem?  ,2,10
MULDER: I see four against one. I got a problem.  ,2,10
MULDER: Who's your dad?  ,2,10
"MULDER: Yeah, I think he would like to hear about this.  ",2,10
"MULDER: Yeah, Eddie, this is all good stuff. Yeah, see what else you can find on him from the N.C.I.C. and call me back. At, at this number or on my cellular.  ",2,10
MULDER: What'd you find?  ,2,10
MULDER: Is that the stuff they use for motion sickness?  ,2,10
MULDER: Is it a controlled substance?  ,2,10
MULDER: I'll drive.  ,2,10
MULDER: I'm Special Agent Fox Mulder. We're with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We'd like to speak to Richard Odin. Is he in?  ,2,10
MULDER: Richard Odin?  ,2,10
MULDER: We'd like to ask you some questions. May we come inside?  ,2,10
"MULDER: Well, how's that?  ",2,10
"MULDER: We can always determine that elsewhere. Can you step outside, please, sir?  ",2,10
"MULDER: Just answer the question, Mister Odin.  ",2,10
"MULDER: Do your religious beliefs preclude you from exacting revenge, either physically or psychically, on those who might not share them?  ",2,10
MULDER: Sheriff...I've already had to go through this once with your kid. Can you just take a walk?  ,2,10
"MULDER: You know, for a holy man, you've got quite a knack for pissing people off.  ",2,10
MULDER: In what way?  ,2,10
MULDER: The growth hormone.  ,2,10
MULDER: Did you know him?  ,2,10
MULDER: Looks like the doctor may have been delivering more than babies.  ,2,10
MULDER: Any clue what this is about?  ,2,10
"MULDER: Well, wherever he was coming from, I'd say that was one hell of a house call.  ",2,10
MULDER: Scully? You're not going to believe this.  ,2,10
"MULDER: Yeah, the print-outs we found in the briefcase were mostly shipping orders along with a list of credit card numbers, each number corresponding to a card in the victim's family.  ",2,10
MULDER: I don't know. Maybe to track them the way credit card companies track stolen cards?  ,2,10
MULDER: What was he treating them with?  ,2,10
"MULDER: I know that was the first thing through both of our minds, Scully, but it just doesn't track. Not with that briefcase full of cash.  ",2,10
MULDER: Gary was never sick.  ,2,10
MULDER: Did you ever take Gary to another doctor?  ,2,10
MULDER: Excuse me? What is this?  ,2,10
MULDER: This light here.  ,2,10
MULDER: There's something back there.  ,2,10
MULDER: Looks like somebody's private little movie studio.  ,2,10
MULDER: What is it?  ,2,10
MULDER: What?  ,2,10
MULDER: That's quite a video library you've compiled for yourself. I especially like the ones with the little boys.  ,2,10
"MULDER: No. No, men who know they're sick try to get help. You just kept right at it for years.  ",2,10
MULDER: Did you kidnap those kids?  ,2,10
MULDER: Are you prepared to confess to those crimes?  ,2,10
MULDER: And to the murders of Rick Mazeroski and...  ,2,10
MULDER: Did you kidnap Rick Mazeroski?  ,2,10
MULDER: Answer the question.  ,2,10
MULDER: Is this how you express your love for them?  ,2,10
MULDER: Why?  ,2,10
MULDER: What'd he become?  ,2,10
"MULDER: You're not making any sense. Now, you... make sense to me.  ",2,10
"MULDER: Okay, what tests?  ",2,10
"MULDER: What do you mean, ""using you?""  ",2,10
MULDER: With growth hormone?  ,2,10
MULDER: So you're saying that Doctor Larson was paying you a lot of money to inject the cattle with something and you didn't know what it was.  ,2,10
MULDER: Was Doctor Larson involved in the kidnapping?  ,2,10
MULDER: Mm-hmm?  ,2,10
"MULDER: Well, how can you be sure?  ",2,10
"MULDER: Do you know what you're saying, Scully?  ",2,10
MULDER: He's been injecting those kids with alien DNA.  ,2,10
"MULDER: But it's the same substance we found in the Erlenmeyer flask, isn't it? The same material my Deep Throat contact died for.  ",2,10
"MULDER: It all makes sense. The money in the briefcase, they've been conducting an experiment here. Somebody's been paying to have those kids injected with alien DNA to see how they'd react. It's been going on for years.  ",2,10
MULDER: No. He's just some poor soul who blew their cover. I don't think he knows any more than he's telling us.  ,2,10
MULDER: What?  ,2,10
"MULDER: Well, whoever's behind this, he's here covering their tracks. He's going to go after the kids. You get the sheriff and meet me at Gary Kane's apartment.  ",2,10
MULDER: Where's Gary?  ,2,10
"MULDER: Go pack some clothes, things you need. You're all coming with me.  ",2,10
MULDER: I'll explain later.  ,2,10
MULDER: I need your help.  ,2,10
MULDER: It may offend your religious sensibilities but it could help save some kids' lives.  ,2,10
MULDER: Stop right there!  ,2,10
MULDER: Hey!  ,2,10
"MULDER: Whatever tape you found in that VCR, it isnt mine.  ",2,11
"MULDER: Well, this definitely isnt mine.  ",2,11
MULDER: What happened to her?  ,2,11
MULDER: Where did you get this? Violent Crimes?  ,2,11
MULDER: Why not?  ,2,11
MULDER: I have several X-Files that document similar cases. (Goes to file cabinet and opens it)  ,2,11
"MULDER: Well, then you none of them have ever been substantiated.  ",2,11
"MULDER: Given the emotional and psychological violence of rape, the face or identity of the attacker is often blurred or erased from memory. That he could be perceived as invisible is a logical leap for me.  ",2,11
MULDER: Why?  ,2,11
"MULDER: Miss Charters, the facts of your case seem to contravene those of other cases we have on file.  ",2,11
MULDER: How do you know it was him who attacked you?  ,2,11
MULDER: Thats right.  ,2,11
MULDER: Thank you for sharing. Are you aware youre being named in a lawsuit against the federal government?  ,2,11
"MULDER: (looking quickly at HAL, surprised, then quickly) Its all right. There seems to be some confusion here.  ",2,11
MULDER: (loudly) Apparently not.  ,2,11
MULDER: (grinning at her) About the guys plumbing?  ,2,11
MULDER: I think this will turn out to be a huge waste of time just like all the other X-Files on entity rape. Unsubstantiated phenomena.  ,2,11
MULDER: We met with a patient today.  ,2,11
MULDER: We met a *resident* who was described to us as having Alzheimers but he actually seemed quite spry and alert.  ,2,11
"MULDER: Ms. Dawson, did you get a chance to see Michelle after the incident? To see the extent of her injuries?  ",2,11
MULDER: Then you know how badly she was hurt.  ,2,11
"MULDER: In your opinion, do you think she staged the attack?  ",2,11
"MULDER: Come on, Hal.  ",2,11
MULDER: So he was actually getting better?  ,2,11
MULDER: (quietly) Is he receiving the same treatments as Hal Arden?  ,2,11
"MULDER: May I sit down, Leo? (no response)  ",2,11
"MULDER: (disgusted) Come on, Scully. Lets get out of here.  ",2,11
MULDER: (bitter) If it would keep anybody out of a place like that it would be important enough. I wouldnt say those people were exactly cured.  ,2,11
"MULDER: Well, I hope someones making some progress cause were going home with a big goose egg. (to hotel clerk) Checking out of room 206 and 210, please.  ",2,11
"MULDER: Between the rape case and the Alzheimers? (very close to her, quietly) When theyre not drawing childlike pictures theyre brutal sex offenders?  ",2,11
MULDER: You think that Michelle Charters was raped by an 74-year-old schizophrenic?  ,2,11
MULDER: An *invisible* 74-year-old schizophrenic?  ,2,11
"MULDER: Are you saying that the buildings haunted? (smiles and laughs, quietly) If you are, youve been working with me for too long, Scully.  ",2,11
MULDER: Why wouldnt it have affected the other residents?  ,2,11
"MULDER: I-I think youre looking too hard, Scully, for something thats not there. I think Michelle Charters concocted this story to get out of a job she hates.  ",2,11
MULDER: He doesnt seem to need much assistance now. Has his improvement been that pronounced?  ,2,11
MULDER: Do you have any idea why?  ,2,11
MULDER: Give me your hand. Come on.  ,2,11
MULDER: Grab it.  ,2,11
MULDER: Apparently. Either that or he was pushed.  ,2,11
MULDER: Thats what were trying to determine. Stan was with him just prior to the accident.  ,2,11
MULDER: There have been two deaths here in the past 24 hours. Stans been present before both of them.  ,2,11
MULDER: What about an elevator?  ,2,11
MULDER: Maybe he was helped.  ,2,11
MULDER: I dont know. The postmortem on Hal Arden  did you get it yet?  ,2,11
MULDER: Can we check and see if its come in yet?  ,2,11
"MULDER: (looks at STAN) Im not sure, exactly.  ",2,11
MULDER: Is the toxicology there?  ,2,11
MULDER: Whats that?  ,2,11
MULDER: Whats ibotenic acid?  ,2,11
"MULDER: Scully, Hal Arden had ibotenic acid in his blood. Somebody poisoned him.  ",2,11
MULDER: Its fantastic.  ,2,11
MULDER: Youve got an Asian orderly working here. Whats his name?  ,2,11
MULDER: Do you know where he is?  ,2,11
MULDER: Upshaw.  ,2,11
"MULDER: But its your mushroom crop, isnt it?  ",2,11
MULDER: Who else would have buried him there?  ,2,11
MULDER: Why?  ,2,11
"MULDER: Makes them feel better, or it kills them?  ",2,11
"MULDER: All right, Gung, who killed the orderly? Who buried him in that room?  ",2,11
MULDER: How are the mushrooms taken?  ,2,11
"MULDER: Well, I think the first thing we should do is make sure nobody else takes them. (to DOCTOR GREGO) You, check on the other patients. Gung, come with me. Lets go.  ",2,11
"MULDER: I think youre right, Scully.  ",2,11
"MULDER: Whats been happening is the result of the medication, but not the medication the Doctors been giving them.  ",2,11
MULDER: Shamans have used them for centuries to gain entrance to the spirit world.  ,2,11
MULDER: Ask any anthropologist then.  ,2,11
MULDER: I dont know how else to explain whats happening here.  ,2,11
"MULDER: And raped Michelle Charters and killed those two orderlies? Somethings been unleashed here, Scully. I dont know how to explain it, but it has something to do with those pills.  ",2,11
MULDER: (yelling through the locked door) Scully! Turn off the water main! Turn off the water main!  ,2,11
MULDER: Youve got to get up. Come on. You got to get up.  ,2,11
MULDER: I cant open the drains.  ,2,11
MULDER: Just hold on. Its all right.  ,2,11
MULDER: Yeah. Fine.  ,2,11
MULDER: I brush after every meal. Would you say they match?  ,2,12
MULDER: Special Agent Sam Chaney.  ,2,12
"MULDER: Chaney's a legend. (Picks up a file and hands it to SCULLY, who opens it and starts flipping through pages. We get a good look at a photo of Chaney.) Forty years before the Bureau started profiling violent criminals, Chaney and his partner Tim Ledbetter would work on their own time investigating what were then called ""stranger killings"" -- what are now called serial murders. They disappeared while investigating three murders in Aubrey, Missouri in 1942. Chaney's body wasn't found until two days ago by local detective, B.J. Morrow ... a woman.  ",2,12
"MULDER: During their time, Chaney's and Ledbetter's ideas weren't very well received by their peers. Using psychology to solve a crime was something like, um ...  ",2,12
MULDER: Exactly. (pauses) There's another mystery.  ,2,12
"MULDER: Well, I'd like to know why this policewoman would suddenly drive her car into a field the size of Rhode Island and for no rhyme or reason dig up the bones of a man who's been missing for fifty years. I mean, unless there was a neon sign saying ""Dig Here"" --  ",2,12
"MULDER: (slyly) Yes, and also I've always been intrigued by women named B.J. (smiles at SCULLY)  ",2,12
"MULDER: Well, the initial police report states that you couldn't explain your actions at the time.  ",2,12
MULDER: What were you doing in the woods at that hour?  ,2,12
MULDER: And you left your car ... (looks around)  ,2,12
MULDER: Would you say that's uh ... four or five hundred yards?  ,2,12
"MULDER: So from that distance, you could see a dog digging in this field at night?  ",2,12
"MULDER: Well, the report says she phoned in from the Motel Black just up the road there. That's not a very short cut.  ",2,12
"MULDER: No, no, not at all. I would just like to ask Detective Morrow a few more questions.  ",2,12
"MULDER: Have you ever, um, have you ever had any clairvoyant experiences? Premonitions, visions, precognitive dreams, things like that?  ",2,12
MULDER: Yeah.  ,2,12
"MULDER: (Sitting on a tabletop perusing a small black leather journal) Listen to this, Scully. ""One must wonder how these monsters are created."" Chaney wrote this. ""Did their home life mold them into creatures that must maim and kill, or are they demons from birth?""  ",2,12
"MULDER: (looking at a file) Well, the press called the murderer ""The Slash Killer."" His three victims were all young women aged twenty-five to thirty. (Flips through a series of gruesome black and white photographs.) He disabled them with a blow to the head.  ",2,12
"MULDER: He would carve the word ""SISTER"" on their chests and paint it on the wall with their blood.  ",2,12
MULDER: The victims bled to death. The murderer was never found.  ,2,12
MULDER: Can you make out a word?  ,2,12
MULDER: I checked with the precinct mechanic. BJ's car was just tuned. She lied about experiencing engine failure. (Sits down next to SCULLY and helps himself to a cookie.)  ,2,12
MULDER: (with mouthful of cookie) What are you talking about?  ,2,12
MULDER: What do you mean?  ,2,12
MULDER: How do you know?  ,2,12
MULDER: (scoffs) Aw ... pshaw.  ,2,12
MULDER: Could he have carved out another word on his ribcage?  ,2,12
"MULDER: Uh, we may have. It seems Agent Chaney might have been a victim of the killer he was trying to catch. We're trying to determine if the cuts on his ribcage spell out a word right now.  ",2,12
MULDER: You all right?  ,2,12
"MULDER: Um, I've approximated the pattern of the cuts to match up with letters. There's a 93% chance that this is the letter R (pointing at the computer screen). If we lower the probability to 79%, we get the letters I, E, and R.  ",2,12
"MULDER: If we exhumed one of the Slash Killer's victims, we could do a CT scan to determine if the cuts were made by the same type of instrument.  ",2,12
MULDER: Excuse me?  ,2,12
MULDER: You're right.  ,2,12
MULDER: I think you're mistaken. Those were shot in 1942.  ,2,12
MULDER: I think we all feel that way at one time or another.  ,2,12
"MULDER: Well, I've often felt that dreams are answers to questions we haven't yet figured out how to ask. (pause) You said you were in a familiar house?  ",2,12
MULDER: What does he look like?  ,2,12
MULDER: Do you remember anything else?  ,2,12
MULDER: You think you could draw it?  ,2,12
MULDER: Could be the Trylon and the Perisphere. Have you ever been to New York City?  ,2,12
MULDER: You can get pictures of these on postcards all over Times Square. These were the symbols of the 1939 World's Fair.  ,2,12
MULDER: And the police never made the connection to the 1942 homicides?  ,2,12
"MULDER: Well, I don't want to jump to any rash conclusions, but I'd say he's definitely our prime suspect.  ",2,12
MULDER: George Foreman won the heavyweight crown at 45. Some people are late bloomers.  ,2,12
"MULDER: Anyway, this still doesn't explain BJ's connection to all this.  ",2,12
MULDER: You mean consciously forgotten information?  ,2,12
"MULDER: Yeah, but that still doesn't explain why she would go into a field and unearth the grave of an FBI agent.  ",2,12
MULDER: You mean a hunch?  ,2,12
"MULDER: Well, that's a pretty extreme hunch.  ",2,12
MULDER: (grinning) I never have.  ,2,12
MULDER: Harry Cokely?  ,2,12
"MULDER: I'm Special Agent Mulder, this is Special Agent Scully. We're with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. May we come in?  ",2,12
MULDER: Do you recognize this man? His name's Chaney.  ,2,12
"MULDER: He was an FBI agent who was also murdered in Aubrey in 1942. Can you tell me where you were about 8:35 PM two nights ago, Mr. Cokely?  ",2,12
MULDER: Do you have a witness to testify to that?  ,2,12
"MULDER: Can you tell us what happened, BJ?  ",2,12
MULDER: You're sure it was him.  ,2,12
MULDER: Like his mug shot?  ,2,12
MULDER: But that's the picture of a young man.  ,2,12
MULDER: It's open.  ,2,12
MULDER: Cokely's blood?  ,2,12
MULDER: But for some reason he let BJ live.  ,2,12
MULDER: I think it's time we paid a visit to Mrs. Thibedeaux.  ,2,12
MULDER: (indicating other pictures that line the wall of the stairs) Is this your husband?  ,2,12
MULDER: No children?  ,2,12
"MULDER: Mrs. Thibedeaux, our records show that you recuperated from your injuries within two months. But nine months later you checked back into the hospital.  ",2,12
MULDER: (stepping closer to her) What happened to the child? (pause) Cokely's child.  ,2,12
"MULDER: (shaking his head) Something just doesn't track, Scully. The night she was attacked, BJ said she saw a younger man.  ",2,12
"MULDER: No, maybe she did see a younger man -- young Cokely. Cokely's grandson.  ",2,12
"MULDER: It would make sense, Scully. Genetic traits often skip a generation. And that would explain the test results of the blood found under Verna Johnson's fingernails. PGM subtypes are similar among relatives. Did Danny call back with the adoption records yet? Did you get 'em?  ",2,12
"MULDER: When I was a, a kid, I would have nightmares. I would wake up in the middle of the night, thinking I was the only person left in the world. Then I would hear this. (Crunches loudly on a sunflower seed.)  ",2,12
MULDER: My dad would be in the study eating these.  ,2,12
"MULDER: Well, on a basic cellular level, we're the sum total of all our ancestors' biological matter. But what if more than biological traits get passed down from generation to generation? What if I like sunflower seeds because I'm genetically predisposed to liking them?  ",2,12
"MULDER: There are countless stories of twins separated at birth who end up in the same occupation, marrying the same kind of people, each naming their child Waldo.  ",2,12
"MULDER: Jung wrote about it when he talked about the collective unconscious. It's genetic memory, Scully.  ",2,12
MULDER: That's BJ's father.  ,2,12
MULDER: She's responsible for the murders.  ,2,12
MULDER: Get your coat. Let's go.  ,2,12
"MULDER: No, but Cokely is, and that's who BJ has become.  ",2,12
"MULDER: Scully, this is what I think. I think that Cokely's memories, his compulsions have been passed on genetically to his granddaughter BJ. That's what's driving her to kill.  ",2,12
MULDER: Yes.  ,2,12
"MULDER: I can't explain everything. Maybe she carved them on herself, or maybe it's some kind of weird stigmata. Whatever it is, BJ is not herself.  ",2,12
"MULDER: We have to warn Mrs. Thibedeaux. If BJ has, in the sense that I'm talking about, become Cokely, then she might be trying to finish what Cokely started.  ",2,12
MULDER: Mrs. Thibedeaux? Mrs. Thibedeaux!  ,2,12
MULDER: Where did she go?  ,2,12
"MULDER: (on the phone) This is Agent Mulder, I need an ambulance to 238 North 54th Street. I also need an APB on BJ Morrow. Yes, that's Detective Morrow. She should be considered armed and dangerous.  ",2,12
"MULDER: (dialing another number) I don't think so, Scully. I think if she's gonna go after anyone, it'll be Cokely.  ",2,12
"MULDER: She's probably figured out by now that Cokely's her grandfather. If she's looking for someone to blame, it'll be him. Cokely's not answering his phone. I'm going over there. (He hangs up and walks out of the house, leaving SCULLY to take care of MRS. THIBEDEAUX.)  ",2,12
MULDER: (running toward the house) Cokely?  ,2,12
"MULDER: Cokely! Cokely? (hears moaning, finds COKELY slumped on the floor, wheezing and bleeding. Behind him, he hears BJ charging at him with a roar. She knocks him right in the head with the oxygen tank. Ouch! MULDER falls on the floor, groaning. Quickly BJ stands over MULDER, straddling him and holding the razor over his head. MULDER tries feebly to slide away.)  ",2,12
"MULDER: No, don't. BJ.  ",2,12
"MULDER: Yes, you are.  ",2,12
MULDER: No. ,2,13
MULDER: Why'd you call Mufon? ,2,13
"MULDER: You think this grave was unearthed by aliens, Agent Bocks? ",2,13
MULDER: The literature? ,2,13
"MULDER: I hate to disappoint you, Agent Bocks, but this doesn't look like the work of aliens to me. ",2,13
"MULDER: I've seen this kind of thing before. When I was with the Violent Crime Section. Whoever dug this up probably used a backhoe. If you took casts of the ground in the area, you'd probably lift some clean new tracks off the garage around here somewhere. ",2,13
"MULDER: He may work here, but it's not likely. Though he's probably worked at a cemetery or a mortuary at one time or another. Probably been busted before, but you're not going to find any record of it. Not real good for business when these stories get around. ",2,13
MULDER: If you want to call him that. ,2,13
"MULDER: You okay, Scully? ",2,13
MULDER: Nothing can prepare you for it. It's almost impossible to imagine. ,2,13
"MULDER: Some people collect salt and pepper shakers. The fetishist collects dead things. Hair, fingernails... no one quite knows why. though I've never quite understood salt and pepper shakers myself. ",2,13
"MULDER: Why? (opens car door for Scully, then goes around the car to get in) ",2,13
MULDER: I've prepared myself for it before we left Washington. ,2,13
MULDER: I had suspected as much. ,2,13
"MULDER (pulls two tickets from his pocket): Vikings versus Redskins, in the Metrodome. Forty yard line, Scully. You and me.  ",2,13
MULDER: How many bodies does this make? ,2,13
MULDER: What else can you tell me about the analysis of the corpses? ,2,13
"MULDER: Alright, I want you to draft an eyes-only memo to everyone in this office, and to all law enforcement agencies in the metropolitan area. ",2,13
MULDER: That the Twin Cities have an escalating fetishist on their hands. ,2,13
"MULDER: An escalating fetishist. Security should be tightened around the city cemeteries. Mortuaries, funeral homes and hospitals should be notified. There should be warning of a possible stalker in the area. ",2,13
MULDER: You can leave out the more gruesome aspects in your press release. ,2,13
"MULDER: His compulsion is growing. He may resort to homicide to procure his corpses. Once he gets a taste of a warm body, he's probably going to want more. ",2,13
MULDER: How's that? ,2,13
"MULDER: If you catch this guy before he kills, maybe they can go right on believing that. ",2,13
"MULDER: I'm going to cancel our flight. We've got some work to do here. Scully (stares forward, still not looking at him) ",2,13
MULDER: Scully? ,2,13
MULDER: Was it him? ,2,13
MULDER: Might be a nice week to take that paid vacation the boss owes you. ,2,13
MULDER: Until he kills again. Or until we can determine what's driving him. ,2,13
"MULDER: The hooker was just convenient. This guy's not after sex. He's after trophies. His victim was a young attractive woman. The corpses he dug up were those of young women. Yet there's no evidence of any sexual activity. What fuels his need? What us important about the hair and fingernails to him? It's as if it's not enough that they're dead. He has to defile them. There's a deeper psychosis at work here. And anger toward women, possibly his mother. ",2,13
MULDER: The next thing to do is call all the psychiatric facilities. See if they have any record of patients with similar pathologies. This kind of killer isn't made over night. He's been fuelling this fetish for years.  ,2,13
"MULDER: Scully, it's me. They've arrested somebody they think may be our guy. Scully (still under shock): I'll get dressed.  ",2,13
MULDER: Who cut him? ,2,13
MULDER: He's not our guy. ,2,13
"MULDER: Yeah. Scully (looks at Bocks, she wants to talk to Mulder alone) ",2,13
MULDER: What are you suggesting? ,2,13
"MULDER: If you're having trouble with this case, Scully, I want you to tell me. ",2,13
"MULDER: I'd understand, Scully. This isn't exactly easy to stomach. ",2,13
"MULDER (knowing she's hiding something): I think it's a good idea. (puts his hand on her shoulder): I just don't want you to think you have to hide anything from me, Scully. I've seen agents with twenty years in the field fall apart on cases like this. Scully (quietly): I'm fine, Mulder. I can handle it. (gently, she pulls away from his touch, and they both leave)  ",2,13
MULDER (on the phone): Mulder. ,2,13
MULDER (to Bocks): Scully got a print. ,2,13
"MULDER: Are you staying on there, Scully? ",2,13
"MULDER: Look, Scully. I know this is a pretty horrific case - ",2,13
"MULDER: Always! Scully (smiles faintly, then): Mulder? You or Agent Bocks didn't call here looking for me earlier, did you? ",2,13
MULDER (to Bocks): Did you call for Agent Scully? Bocks (shakes his head) ,2,13
"MULDER: No. Scully (curious) Okay, I'll see you when I get there. (hangs up)  ",2,13
"MULDER: She was forced off the road, it looks like a white car... get one of your men to get a sample of this paint and get it on a plane to Washington... if you hurry we can get a make and model of the car by morning... we're gonna find her.  ",2,13
MULDER (on his own cellular phone): Nothing? No one saw her leave the rental agency...? There was no attendant in the area...? (presses the 'end' button in frustration) (to Bocks): People videotape police beatings on dark streets. They see Elvis in three cities across America every day. But no one saw a pretty woman being run off the road in her rental car. ,2,13
"MULDER: We've got to go back to the beginning. As nasty as it seems, we've got to get into this guy's head. How he thinks. Where would he go? ",2,13
MULDER: What do you mean? ,2,13
MULDER (interested): Where does his mother live? ,2,13
MULDER: Let's find out.  ,2,13
MULDER (disappointed): did she have a car registered to her? ,2,13
MULDER (realizing): He inherited the car. Boca Raton could have been a winter house. Was there a residence here in Minneapolis?  ,2,13
MULDER (gun brandished): FEDERAL AGENTS! HANDS IN THE AIR!  ,2,13
MULDER (loudly): Let's get the paramedics out here! ,2,13
"MULDER: Just stay there, Scully. ",2,13
"MULDER: His Mother used to own the house, willed it to the sisters. I played a hunch. A patrolman spotted the car out front.  ",2,13
MULDER: Why don't you sit down until someone can take a look at you. ,2,13
"MULDER'S VOICE OVER: The conquest of fear lies in the moment of its acceptance. And understanding what scares us most is that which is most familiar, most common place. That boy next door, Donnie Pfaster, the unremarkable younger brother of four older sisters, extraordinary only in his ordinariness, could grow up to be the devil in a buttoned-down shirt. It's been said that the fear of the unknown is an irrational response to the excesses of the imagination. But our fear of the everyday, of the lurking stranger, and the sound of foot-falls on the stairs. The fear of violent death and the primitive impulse to survive, are as frightening as any x-file, as real as the acceptance that it could happen to you.  ",2,13
"MULDER: ""They""?  ",2,14
"MULDER: ""The Night Chicago Died""? (He walks away)  ",2,14
MULDER: Was Jerry Stevens or his friends ever witnessed participating in witchcraft?  ,2,14
"MULDER: I think with a few turquoise chips, a picture of John Wayne and three cans of shellac it'd make a pretty nice coffee table.  ",2,14
MULDER: Better hide your Megadeth albums.  ,2,14
MULDER: The homicide did have a ceremonial presentation -- the manner in which the body was displayed...  ,2,14
"MULDER: I didn't want to incite his already clearly aggravated imagination. But there is a weird feel to this place, maybe there is some truth to those rumours.  ",2,14
MULDER: So... lunch?  ,2,14
"MULDER: I guess their parachutes didn't open. You were saying something about this place not feeling ""odd""?  ",2,14
"MULDER: ""Witch Hunt: A History of the Occult in America"". (He hands her the card)  ",2,14
"MULDER: (Turns away from window) If you didn't kill Jerry Stevens, why did you run away from us in the classroom?  ",2,14
MULDER: Of us?  ,2,14
MULDER: (Shrugging) There's no evidence to warrant an arrest.  ,2,14
"MULDER: (Aside, to Scully, but audible by the others) ""They"" again.  ",2,14
"MULDER: (Looks at Scully, makes quick decision) Our investigation is ongoing.  ",2,14
MULDER: (Half to himself) The water...  ,2,14
MULDER: It's going down the drain counter-clockwise! Coriolis force in the Northern Hemisphere dictates that it should go down clockwise.  ,2,14
"MULDER: Something's here, Scully. Something is making these things possible.  ",2,14
"MULDER: (Looking through notes) Your records indicate a high incidence of students complaining of depression, headaches, eating disorders...?  ",2,14
MULDER: (Looks up) I'm assuming you're familiar with the early indications of repressed memory?  ,2,14
MULDER: In your counselling you've found no evidence of past ritual abuse?  ,2,14
MULDER: Would it be possible for me to speak to any of the students who've had chronic complaints?  ,2,14
"MULDER: For the body of student of complaints, he was pretty quick to dismiss my concerns.  ",2,14
"MULDER: (Looks back at the office, then at Scully) Well, he's hiding something.  ",2,14
MULDER: (Interest quickens) Where's that pulled from -- the local paper?  ,2,14
"MULDER: Modern witches, known as Wicca, are a religion. They have a great reverence for all life in Nature, they do not cast harmful spells, they don't worship Satan. Even the Church of Satan has renounced murder and torture. Their influence here wouldn't account for the frogs, or the water draining backwards, or most importantly, the murder.  ",2,14
"MULDER: Shannon! You're remembering! (Shannon slows, halts just past the drinking fountain. She is crying again, but more controlled this time. Mulder walks slowly toward her, very concerned. He says softly) Tell me what you're remembering.  ",2,14
MULDER: Imagine... if what she said is true...  ,2,14
MULDER: Mr Ausbury?  ,2,14
MULDER: Did you do it?  ,2,14
MULDER: That's not a very Christian tenet.  ,2,14
MULDER'S POV: LOOKING DOWN A FLIGHT OF STEPS INTO A CELLAR.  ,2,14
MULDER: Even the Devil can quote scripture to fit his needs.  ,2,14
MULDER: Her office has a faint odour of incense. (LOOKS BACK AT THE DISTRAUGHT PADDOCK).  ,2,14
MULDER: It's also used in Black Mass rituals.  ,2,14
"MULDER: What do you mean, oddities?  ",2,14
MULDER: Flesh-eating bacteria? (APPRECIATIVELY) That's very rare.  ,2,14
"MULDER: No, I've got a feeling this is something we both should get caught up in. I'm going to get a search warrant for the Ausbury house -- I've been told they're staying with friends. (HE GLANCES OVER AT PADDOCK) You check deeper into Mrs Paddock.  ",2,14
MULDER NODS SYMPATHETICALLY.  ,2,14
MULDER: Did you abuse Shannon?  ,2,14
MULDER: The rituals.  ,2,14
"MULDER: Like... drinking grape juice instead of wine at Communion? (AUSBURY HALF-NODS, WALKS AWAY) What about Shannon's memories? (AUSBURY TURNS BACK.)  ",2,14
MULDER: Did the others kill Jerry Stevens? (AUSBURY SHAKES HIS HEAD) Shannon?  ,2,14
"MULDER: But you are responsible. You knew the possibilities contained in your beliefs, no matter how watered down. (AUSBURY IS IMPASSIVE, STONY-FACED) Did you really think you could call up the Devil and ask him to behave?  ",2,14
"MULDER: Who are the others? (MULDER'S PHONE RINGS TWICE. HE HAULS IT OUT OF HIS POCKET EXASPERATEDLY) Yeah? (WE HEAR SCULLY'S VOICE, FAINT AND SCARED)  ",2,14
MULDER: Scully? (HE PACKS THE PHONE AWAY) I've got an emergency. (He takes Ausbury by the arm and leads him unprotestingly to the staircase) I'm placing you under arrest. (He handcuffs ausbury to the bannister and puts his torch down on the stairs) I'll be back for you later.  ,2,14
MULDER: Scully!  ,2,14
MULDER: (LOWERING GUN) You called me! You said you were in trouble.  ,2,14
"MULDER: Ausbury confessed to conspiracy. He was going to give up the names of everybody involved, parents, teachers...  ",2,14
MULDER: There's no evidence of any reaction of the wood from the acid. (HE TURNS BACK) There are tracks in the dirt... they're from a snake.  ,2,14
"MULDER: You really do watch the Learning Channel. (HE GETS UP, GOES TO PICK SOMETHING UP FROM THE FLOOR. HE HOLDS IT UP, PLAYING HIS TORCH OVER IT) Scully. (SHE TURNS TO LOOK) Snakeskin.  ",2,14
MULDER: We know about that.  ,2,14
"MULDER: Paramedics must be tied up by the storm. You just stay there, Mrs Paddock. I'm going to lock the door.  ",2,14
MULDER AND SCULLY ARE STRUGGLING TO GET FREE.  ,2,14
MULDER: Paddock.  ,2,14
"MULDER: Private John McAlpin-- one of the few, the proud ... the dead. Last week he wrapped his car around a tree. Died on impact.  ",2,15
MULDER: The military is calling it a suicideTheyre especially concerned because its the second one in as many weeks.  ,2,15
"MULDER: Yeah, except that it's not exactly a base. Flip to the back. The Marines were all stationed at the Folkstone processing center in North Carolina. More than 12,000 refugees waiting for asylum from Uncle Sam.  ",2,15
"MULDER: A ten year old boy was killed but the uh, details of his death were never released.  ",2,15
MULDER: They didn't. Mrs. McAlpin contacted the Bureau when the military refused her request to investigate her husband's death further.  ,2,15
MULDER: (pointing) There.  ,2,15
MULDER: This is the tree that stopped Private McAlpin's car. State police reported there's graffiti on the bark.  ,2,15
MULDER: Most of the refugees at Folkstone are Haitian.  ,2,15
MULDER: Mrs. McAlpin doesn't believe her husband killed himself. She wants to know who did.  ,2,15
MULDER: Did he believe in voodoo?  ,2,15
"MULDER: So, when did you first think that his death involved something out of the ordinary?  ",2,15
MULDER: Who told you that?  ,2,15
MULDER: What about you?  ,2,15
MULDER: How much?  ,2,15
MULDER: Ill give you five.  ,2,15
MULDER: You should always carry protection. Hold on. (hands CHESTER money and takes small cloth bag) There you go.  ,2,15
"MULDER: Colonel Wharton, a, uh... A certain ritual sign was found at the scene of both deaths. Is there anything you can tell us about that?  ",2,15
MULDER: But you haven't investigated it as a possibility.  ,2,15
MULDER: We understand a refugee was killed-- a young boy.  ,2,15
MULDER: Who would that be?  ,2,15
MULDER: Do you think we could speak with him?  ,2,15
MULDER: Youre Harry Dunham.  ,2,15
MULDER: You knew Private McAlpin? His wife said you were friends.  ,2,15
MULDER: Any idea why he might have killed himself?  ,2,15
MULDER: You can't say or you won't say?  ,2,15
MULDER: My name is Mulder. I'm with the FBI. I was hoping you could answer some questions about the two US Marines who took their own lives.  ,2,15
MULDER: I'm not convinced it's as simple as that.  ,2,15
MULDER: You tell me. These photographs were taken at the sites of both deaths. (shows him photos) The shell was found buried under one of the soldiers' homes. Can you tell me about the symbol?  ,2,15
MULDER: Just the truth. One of the Marines left behind a wife. She's too frightened to even mourn. She deserves some peace of mind.  ,2,15
MULDER: Colonel Wharton says you incited the riot last month.  ,2,15
MULDER: Does that mean you would kill to preserve it?  ,2,15
"MULDER: Come on, Scully. Let's go.  ",2,15
MULDER: So what do you think happened to Private McAlpin?  ,2,15
MULDER: It's quite a trick considering he's been confined for the last month.  ,2,15
MULDER: But you said there was no trace evidence. And security is practically impossible to breach.  ,2,15
"MULDER: Well, just in case, I believe in covering my bases.  ",2,15
"MULDER: Scully, look out!  ",2,15
MULDER: Hey...  ,2,15
MULDER: Its a plausible diagnosis. Only I'm more interested in how he came back to life.  ,2,15
MULDER: Did you get a copy of the blood test?  ,2,15
"MULDER: Somehow, I get the feeling Private McAlpin didn't frequent too many sushi bars.  ",2,15
MULDER: What do you know about zombies?  ,2,15
"MULDER: In 1982, a Harvard ethnobotanist named Wade Davis did extensive field research in Haiti on the zombification phenomenon. He analyzed several samples of zombie powder prepared by voodoo priests and he found tetrodotoxin to be common to all of them.  ",2,15
MULDER: But in small enough doses it can cause paralysis and depress cardiorespiratory activities to such a low level that the victim might appear clinically dead.  ,2,15
MULDER: Exactly. Which is what makes me wonder about the other Marine who allegedly killed himself.  ,2,15
MULDER: (showing badge) Yeah. We've arranged to exhume the body of Manuel Guttierez.  ,2,15
MULDER: These body snatchers  What do they do with the bodies?  ,2,15
MULDER: To who?  ,2,15
MULDER: Let us take care of this.  ,2,15
MULDER: Maybe you can tell us.  ,2,15
MULDER: What about a name?  ,2,15
"MULDER: What do you do with the frogs, Chester?  ",2,15
MULDER: From who? Who pays you for them?  ,2,15
"MULDER: Hey, Chester. I got magic, too, and I bet I can make your fries reappear.  ",2,15
"MULDER: (speaking very quietly to SCULLY) I didn't want to say anything before because I wasn't sure, but I think we're being followed. It's a gray four-door sedan in the parking lot. Keep an eye on Chester.  ",2,15
"MULDER: Out of the car, Private. You've been following us.  ",2,15
MULDER: You didnt seem too interested in helping us before.  ,2,15
MULDER: Chester? He's just a little boy.  ,2,15
MULDER: Private Dunham was just about to tell us why we're in danger.  ,2,15
MULDER: But you do?  ,2,15
MULDER: Unless what?  ,2,15
MULDER: You said that Bauvais threatened the Colonels men.  ,2,15
MULDER: You believe he can do that?  ,2,15
"MULDER: Till I can figure out why hed lie, yeah.  ",2,15
MULDER: Why would he be trying to avoid Chester?  ,2,15
MULDER: Chester? Chester?  ,2,15
MULDER: Chester! Chester! Stop! Im not going to hurt you! (to SCULLY) Its okay. Ill get him. Chester! Chester!  ,2,15
MULDER: (polite sarcasm) Thats all right. We already ate.  ,2,15
MULDER: Thats right.  ,2,15
MULDER: His body was missing-- stolen from his coffin apparently.  ,2,15
"MULDER: Well, well let you finish. Wouldnt want your breakfast to get cold.  ",2,15
MULDER: Whartons left these people no choice but to fight back with the only weapon they have.  ,2,15
MULDER: Not according to Private Dunham.  ,2,15
MULDER: What?  ,2,15
MULDER: (reaching for SCULLYs bleeding hand) Let me see that.  ,2,15
MULDER: I was surprised to get your card. I had assumed our last contact... would be our last. Why are you here?  ,2,15
MULDER: I've got a renegade Marine who may be violating every human rights provision...  ,2,15
MULDER: What about Scully and me?  ,2,15
MULDER: (sighs) They're making the camp invisible. Why?  ,2,15
MULDER: Why hold them up? Why not just repatriate them?  ,2,15
MULDER: Youre saying the military's sanctioning Wharton's revenge? These people are innocent civilians. Some people in Congress might have a real problem with that.  ,2,15
MULDER: Scully? (enters bathroom holding gun on PRIVATE MCALPIN)  ,2,15
MULDER: I found him wandering around outside. You all right?  ,2,15
MULDER: When I found him. He had this in his hand.  ,2,15
MULDER: Do you recall leaving the hospital?  ,2,15
MULDER: Do you remember killing Private Dunham?  ,2,15
MULDER: Colonel... Can we have a word outside?  ,2,15
MULDER: What exactly did you tell him?  ,2,15
MULDER: I need to know that he signed that confession voluntarily?  ,2,15
MULDER: Since his  reappearance has Private McAlpin had any contact with Bauvais?  ,2,15
"MULDER: Well, we'd still like to speak with Bauvais.  ",2,15
MULDER: Why?  ,2,15
MULDER: What's wrong?  ,2,15
"MULDER: (on phone) Mulder. .. Okay, Mrs. McAlpin. We can be there in fifteen minutes.  ",2,15
"MULDER: Mrs. McAlpin, you said on the telephone that Private Dunham came here last night. What did he want?  ",2,15
MULDER: For what reason?  ,2,15
MULDER: When in Rome   ,2,15
MULDER: Scully . Look at this. Check out the name on the dogtags.  ,2,15
MULDER: Wheres Wharton?  ,2,15
MULDER: He killed Bauvais. If you know anything about it youll be tried as an accessory to murder  ,2,15
"MULDER: If you dont believe us, look in the trunk.  ",2,15
MULDER: (handing over dogtags) This is whats left of Private Guttierez. Now wheres Bauvais body?  ,2,15
"MULDER: What is it, Scully?  ",2,15
MULDER: You dont look all right.  ,2,15
"MULDER: Federal Agent! Drop the knife, Wharton.  ",2,15
MULDER: Drop the knife!  ,2,15
MULDER: Ah!!!  ,2,15
MULDER: Youre okay?  ,2,15
MULDER: I dont know.  ,2,15
MULDER: No. It was Bauvais.  ,2,15
MULDER: Too bad it has to be in a box.  ,2,15
"MULDER: I have lived with a fragile faith built on the ether of vague memories from an experience that I can neither prove nor explain.When I was twelve, my sister was taken from me, taken from our home by a force that I came to believe was extraterrestrial.  ",2,16
"MULDER: What happened to me out on the ice has justified every belief. If I should die now, it would be with the certainty that my faith has been righteous. And if, through death, larger mysteries are revealed, I will have already learned the answer to the question that has driven me here... that there is intelligent life in the universe other than our own... that they are here among us... and that they have begun to colonize.  ",2,16
MULDER: I have been looking for you.  ,2,16
MULDER: You got to wonder about a country where even the President has to worry about drive-by shootings.  ,2,16
MULDER: I found these in my e-mail this morning... three obituaries.  ,2,16
MULDER: Nobody I know but obviously somebody who knows me.  ,2,16
"MULDER: The deceased are Doctor Landon Prince of Scranton, Pennsylvania...  ",2,16
MULDER: Sounds like it.  ,2,16
MULDER: It's taken me all morning to figure that out.  ,2,16
"MULDER: This is the latest victim, Doctor Landon Prince. And these are the other two victims... Doctors Gayhart...  ",2,16
"MULDER: Nope. I can't find any blood connection between them. In fact, I can't find any records on them at all. It's as if before they died, they never existed.  ",2,16
MULDER: You don't know anything else about him?  ,2,16
MULDER: As soon as you locate Doctor Prince's remains.  ,2,16
"MULDER: Well, there have been two identical fire deaths. Neither body has been found.  ",2,16
"MULDER: Is that what you think, Reverend?  ",2,16
"MULDER: Well, it's my opinion that whoever killed Doctor Prince will also be linked to two other murders. How do you feel about that?  ",2,16
MULDER: Have you been to New York or New Jersey in the past two weeks?  ,2,16
"MULDER: This clipping, where'd you get it?  ",2,16
MULDER: Which newspaper?  ,2,16
MULDER: Do you have a record of his name or address?  ,2,16
MULDER: Thank you.  ,2,16
MULDER: What do you mean?  ,2,16
MULDER: Sounds just like an X-File.  ,2,16
"MULDER: If somebody really wanted to set us up, would they give us this little to go on? There's something bigger here, Scully. I'd be willing to bet there are more of these guys out there.  ",2,16
"MULDER: Unless we get to them first. The deaths follow a pattern... New Jersey, New York, Scranton...  ",2,16
"MULDER: How, how would you access that?  ",2,16
MULDER: That's north.  ,2,16
"MULDER: Yeah, this is Agent Mulder. I need to enlist your help.  ",2,16
"MULDER: I'm heading your way with Agent Scully. We have reason to believe a man in your area may be in danger. His name is Doctor Aaron Baker, he's living somewhere in Syracuse. We need you to find him and sit on him...  ",2,16
"MULDER: Yes, Agent Weiss?  ",2,16
MULDER: Did you find Doctor Baker?  ,2,16
"MULDER: Uh, we may already be too late but we should take a look around anyway.  ",2,16
"MULDER: Sorry I'm late, I just flew in.  ",2,16
MULDER: Syracuse.  ,2,16
MULDER: Agent Scully and I were following up a lead on a case.  ,2,16
"MULDER: No, sir.  ",2,16
"MULDER: No, sir. I'd assumed we had an understanding with respect to the X-Files.  ",2,16
MULDER: What?  ,2,16
"MULDER: It's impossible... I spoke to Agent Weiss, I saw him at the house.  ",2,16
MULDER: Sir...  ,2,16
MULDER: Mulder.  ,2,16
MULDER: Where are you?  ,2,16
"MULDER: Agent Weiss is dead, Scully.  ",2,16
MULDER: Somebody killed him and Skinner hit the roof. We're being grounded until he gets a full accounting.  ,2,16
"MULDER: No, why?  ",2,16
MULDER: What is it?  ,2,16
MULDER: Yeah?  ,2,16
"MULDER: Stay where you are, Scully, I'll be right there to pick you up.  ",2,16
MULDER: What case is that?  ,2,16
MULDER: How did they get here?  ,2,16
MULDER: For what purpose?  ,2,16
MULDER: What's your business in this?  ,2,16
MULDER: What makes you think we've been contacted?  ,2,16
MULDER: We know where one of these man may be.  ,2,16
MULDER: Doctor Dickens?  ,2,16
MULDER: I believe you've been trying to contact us.  ,2,16
"MULDER: It's okay, sir, there's nothing to be afraid of!  ",2,16
MULDER: He's moving... he's getting up!  ,2,16
MULDER: Okay. I just got the wind knocked out of me. Don't lose him! Go!  ,2,16
MULDER: Like I should've used the crosswalk. A lot better than my phone.  ,2,16
"MULDER: Scully, if what our friend from the C.I.A. says is true, this could blow the lid off one of the biggest national security conspiracies ever.  ",2,16
"MULDER: Oh, I changed it to ""trust everyone."" I didn't tell you?  ",2,16
"MULDER: I think you're being overly paranoid about him, Scully.  ",2,16
MULDER: Is that what you want me to put on my report to Skinner? Because I would be more than happy to have you explain that to him.  ,2,16
"MULDER: Three identical men are dead. A fourth identical man is alive and on the lam. If the pursuit of this case seems like insanity to you, feel free to step away from it.  ",2,16
MULDER: Those are the risks we take. You either accept them or you don't. We all draw our own lines.  ,2,16
MULDER: Why don't you send it to our lab guys for analysis?  ,2,16
"MULDER: In putting together my report for Skinner, I came across something I think you'll appreciate. Whoever killed that field agent in Syracuse was so clever, no clear cause of death can be established.  ",2,16
MULDER: Strange how?  ,2,16
MULDER: How excessive?  ,2,16
MULDER: Due to what?  ,2,16
MULDER: Didn't Agent Chapel say something about these doctors being able to contaminate the blood supply? Couldn't one of those contaminants have been used to kill this man?  ,2,16
MULDER: Yeah?  ,2,16
"MULDER: All right, I'll be right there.  ",2,16
MULDER: Just the truth. I got hit by a car.  ,2,16
"MULDER: I'm sorry this is so late. I had trouble with the, uh, data from the, uh, autopsy...  ",2,16
MULDER: Thank you.  ,2,16
MULDER: Mom?  ,2,16
"MULDER: Yeah, I, I didn't expect you to answer. Wha, what are you doing at Dad's? Is he all right?  ",2,16
MULDER: Dad?  ,2,16
MULDER: Can you tell me what this is about?  ,2,16
"MULDER: Check it out, I'll call you as soon as I can.  ",2,16
MULDER: Home.  ,2,16
"MULDER ON MACHINE: Hello, this is Fox Mulder. Leave me a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.  ",2,16
MULDER: You said it was an emergency.  ,2,16
"MULDER: What is it, Dad?  ",2,16
MULDER: Who is Mom talking to?  ,2,16
MULDER: You're exhausted. We all are. It's after 5:30.  ,2,16
MULDER: Try and get some sleep.  ,2,16
"MULDER: Yeah, Mom?  ",2,16
MULDER: I... I don't see who else it could be.  ,2,16
MULDER: It's twenty-two years too late.  ,2,16
MULDER: So much has happened. Where do you begin?  ,2,16
MULDER: Who were they?  ,2,16
MULDER: But you came to remember... us.  ,2,16
MULDER: What do you mean?  ,2,16
MULDER: Your f... your father.  ,2,16
"MULDER: Hey, Scully, it's Mulder, pick up the phone. Okay, if you're screening, pick up the phone, I need to talk to you.  ",2,16
MULDER: Disguise himself how?  ,2,16
MULDER: As anyone? You got to be kidding.  ,2,16
"MULDER ON MACHINE: Hello, this is Fox Mulder. Leave a message, please.  ",2,16
"MULDER: Yeah, I need to speak to Dana Scully, please.  ",2,16
"MULDER: All right, I need her to call Fox Mulder as soon as she checks in, okay? Fox Mulder.  ",2,16
MULDER: Yes.  ,2,16
"MULDER: Scully, it's me.  ",2,16
"MULDER: (on phone) Scully, it's me, where are you?  ",2,16
MULDER: (on phone) Scully? Are you there? Scully? What's going on?  ,2,17
MULDER: Who was that?  ,2,17
"MULDER: I, I was trying to reach you. I went by your house but you weren't there. I got here as quickly as I could.  ",2,17
"MULDER: I, I, I did call. I, I couldn't get through.  ",2,17
"MULDER: Scully, what are you doing?  ",2,17
MULDER: What's wrong?  ,2,17
"MULDER: Scully, it's me...  ",2,17
"MULDER: Okay, I'm going to take my left hand and reach into my pocket and get my I.D., okay? Just don't shoot me. I got shot once and I didn't much care for it.  ",2,17
MULDER: Where is he?  ,2,17
MULDER: Scully?  ,2,17
MULDER: How do you know?  ,2,17
MULDER: There's no sign of a break-in. She wouldn't have just let him in.  ,2,17
"MULDER: Why, why does he want to kill you?  ",2,17
MULDER: How?  ,2,17
MULDER: That would kill anybody.  ,2,17
MULDER: Fairly sure?  ,2,17
MULDER: From what?  ,2,17
"MULDER: No, no, no, no, no... that's just it. It doesn't seem incredible at all. Now, how do we find him?  ",2,17
MULDER: You're sure?  ,2,17
MULDER: And if he doesn't get it?  ,2,17
"MULDER: No, it's not hard. It's unbelievable.  ",2,17
"MULDER: After twenty-two years, why come back?  ",2,17
"MULDER: No, no, you've explained only what you had to! I know next to nothing about these people you call your parents or about the man who wants to kill them.  ",2,17
MULDER: A colony?  ,2,17
MULDER: What are they trying to accomplish?  ,2,17
MULDER: And in the meantime?  ,2,17
"MULDER: All the clones worked in abortion clinics, why?  ",2,17
MULDER: And this man... why has he been sent to kill them?  ,2,17
MULDER: That's a good story... but I've heard a lot of good stories lately.  ,2,17
MULDER: Who is it?  ,2,17
MULDER: The door's open.  ,2,17
MULDER: Orders from my opthamologist.  ,2,17
"MULDER: Yeah, I'm fine.  ",2,17
MULDER: I haven't checked my messages.  ,2,17
"MULDER: This is my sister, Samantha Mulder.  ",2,17
"MULDER: I haven't had time to explain, Agent Scully is missing.  ",2,17
MULDER: Hello.  ,2,17
"MULDER: Scully, where are you?  ",2,17
"MULDER: Well, what does he want?  ",2,17
"MULDER: All right, tell him we'll negotiate.  ",2,17
"MULDER: All right, let me speak to him.  ",2,17
"MULDER: Scully, I need time, I need more time than that.  ",2,17
"MULDER: We don't, we don't have any time. If I ever needed your help, your trust, I need it now.  ",2,17
MULDER: We just need to get him out of the car. Make him think we're going to make a trade. We just need one shot.  ,2,17
MULDER: These guys can hollow out a dime at two-hundred yards.  ,2,17
"MULDER: Scully, you all right?  ",2,17
MULDER: Yeah?  ,2,17
MULDER: There's no way out. We've got both sides of the bridge covered. Now let her go.  ,2,17
MULDER: Let her go!  ,2,17
"MULDER: You should be in the hospital, Scully.  ",2,17
MULDER: Nothing yet. You think she could've survived?  ,2,17
"MULDER: Well, maybe she went into hypothermic shock. I've heard about people who have lived after being stranded in water like this... eight to ten hours.  ",2,17
MULDER: I couldn't tell you.  ,2,17
MULDER: Cause you'd never let me go through with it.  ,2,17
MULDER: Why would you even question me on that?  ,2,17
"MULDER: Well, it was her.  ",2,17
MULDER: He's an alien.  ,2,17
"MULDER: I already told Skinner, that was the easy part. Now I got to tell my father.  ",2,17
MULDER: Samantha's gone... Dad. I lost her.  ,2,17
MULDER: There was a man... he was holding my partner hostage in exchange for Samantha.  ,2,17
"MULDER: I, I can't explain it to you, but, um... I believed I was doing the right thing, Dad.  ",2,17
MULDER: Yes. I'll tell Mom.  ,2,17
"MULDER: I'm sorry, Dad. I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry.  ",2,17
MULDER: Mulder.  ,2,17
"MULDER: Scully, she left a path in case we got separated. I think she's alive.  ",2,17
MULDER: Why? What'd you find?  ,2,17
MULDER: Are you sure?  ,2,17
MULDER: What about a second body? Did you find a second body?  ,2,17
MULDER: I'll be there as soon as I can.  ,2,17
MULDER: Federal agent. Put your hands where I can see them and turn around. Slowly.  ,2,17
MULDER: What the hell is going on?  ,2,17
MULDER: Who are you?  ,2,17
MULDER: It was all a lie.  ,2,17
MULDER: Who?  ,2,17
MULDER: He's dead.  ,2,17
MULDER: He was shot. In the back of the neck!  ,2,17
MULDER: He fell off a bridge... with one of you.  ,2,17
MULDER: I'm not your savior.  ,2,17
"MULDER: No, I... I do have a choice and my choice is to walk out of here.  ",2,17
MULDER: What about the others?  ,2,17
MULDER: No. Wait. There were women in here.  ,2,17
MULDER: No. You've got to keep looking...  ,2,17
MULDER: How was the opera?  ,2,17
MULDER: I'm sorry. I need your help.  ,2,17
MULDER: I need to know what you know.  ,2,17
"MULDER: No. One of them is alive, the one who was sent to kill them. Where is he?  ",2,17
MULDER: I got to get up there.  ,2,17
"MULDER: Scully, when you get this message, I will be too far away for you to stop me, but where I'm going I cannot allow you to follow. I won't let you jeopardize your life and your career for reasons purely personal to me. You were right, Scully... you said a line has to be drawn somewhere. I'm drawing it for you here. I'll contact you when I can.  ",2,17
MULDER: Hey!  ,2,17
MULDER: Step out of there!  ,2,17
"MULDER: Don't look at me, face forward!  ",2,17
MULDER: So why did you run?  ,2,17
MULDER: How is it you managed to survive?  ,2,17
MULDER: No. I'm just tired and you're not getting back to your ship until I get the truth. Now tell me where my sister is.  ,2,17
"MULDER: Base of the neck! Now, you tell me how I can find her and I'll let you get back to your ship before it's destroyed!  ",2,17
MULDER: Where is she?  ,2,17
MULDER: Where is she?  ,2,17
MULDER: Like I got a bad case of freezer burn. How did I get here?  ,2,17
"MULDER: I... I'm sorry, I... I couldn't let you risk your life on this.  ",2,17
MULDER: No. No. But I... I found something I thought I'd lost. Faith to keep looking.  ,2,17
MULDER: What did the janitors say?  ,2,18
MULDER: That's not surprising. The security monitors don't have a recording of anything either. Just a giant implosion of glass like some kind of giant shock wave.  ,2,18
"MULDER: No sonic boom did this. (points to the crushed car on the street) The construction worker who was killed had his spine crushed like a string of seashells, a circular abrasion on his torso in roughly the shape of an elephant's foot. Other workers at the site said they felt the ground shake followed by a faint whiff of animal odor in the wind.  ",2,18
"MULDER: Well, if somebody would have seen it, Scully, we wouldn't be here. Another vehicle would have left evidence of a collision - distress to the metal, or paint. I can see signs of neither of those things. I'd be willing to admit the possibility of a tornado but it's not really tornado season. I'd even be willing to entertain the notion of a black hole passing over the area ... (Scully gives him a skeptical glance) ... or some cosmic anomaly, but it's not really black hole season, either. (he smiles) If I was a betting man I'd say that it was, uh, ...  ",2,18
MULDER: I saw David Copperfield make the Statue of Liberty disappear once.  ,2,18
MULDER: Yeah.  ,2,18
MULDER: This is Agent Scully.  ,2,18
MULDER: How did she escape?  ,2,18
MULDER: Any idea how she could have escaped a locked cage?  ,2,18
"MULDER: I've read about something called the elephant rebellion in zoos across the country - a high incidence of elephants turning on their keepers, destroying their pens. Was Ganesha ever a problem like that?  ",2,18
MULDER: So you're saying there were problems?  ,2,18
"MULDER: Well, let me ask you something. In your opinion, the damage here on the street - could this have been caused by an escaped elephant?  ",2,18
MULDER: Yeah.  ,2,18
MULDER: A local paper. I want to see if David Copperfield's in town.  ,2,18
"MULDER: Actually, what we're trying to determine is how Ganesha escaped.  ",2,18
"MULDER: He said he found the cage locked, the same way he left it.  ",2,18
"MULDER: I don't want to belabor this, but a man was found trampled to death. An animal from your zoo was found 43 miles from here. No one's looking to place any blame, we're just trying to understand the facts that led up to this incident.  ",2,18
MULDER: Who has keys to this lock?  ,2,18
"MULDER: Those, uh, chains on the ground there?  ",2,18
MULDER: Disallowed their use by whom?  ,2,18
MULDER: How's your relationship with Ed Meecham?  ,2,18
MULDER: Have you spoken about the incident with Ed?  ,2,18
MULDER: It's the Wild Again Organization - they're a radical group that believes any captive animal is a crime against nature.  ,2,18
MULDER: What do you think Ganesha was running from?  ,2,18
MULDER: This is still going on?  ,2,18
MULDER: Even though Willa Ambrose claims that she's put a stop to most of his old practices?  ,2,18
"MULDER: I'm sure he would have if he'd seen it coming. Thanks for your time, sir, and we'll get back to you soon.  ",2,18
"MULDER: It's all happening at the zoo, Scully.  ",2,18
MULDER: You think they busted out the elephant?  ,2,18
"MULDER: What about all the eyewitness accounts, the security tapes from the video camera, the fact no one saw an elephant until it was miles away from the zoo?  ",2,18
"MULDER: Ah, I'm not buying it, Scully. I think these guys are all talk.  ",2,18
MULDER: No.  ,2,18
MULDER: By doing what?  ,2,18
MULDER: All right. You keep an eye on the W.A.O.  ,2,18
MULDER: Talk to the animals.  ,2,18
"MULDER: Did anybody ever tell you the camera loves you, Frohike?  ",2,18
"MULDER: Uh, about 150 bucks an hour.  ",2,18
MULDER: Where's Langley?  ,2,18
MULDER: I'm in the town of Fairfield. What do you know about it?  ,2,18
MULDER: Any idea why?  ,2,18
MULDER: (smiling) (to phone) Mulder.  ,2,18
"MULDER: All right, I'll be right there, Scully.  ",2,18
MULDER: Scully?  ,2,18
"MULDER: You okay, Scully?  ",2,18
MULDER: You calmed down?  ,2,18
"MULDER: No, but I looked at the cassette from the kid's recorder. He wasn't killed by the tiger.  ",2,18
"MULDER: Unless it's trick photography, that kid was killed by some kind of phantom attacker.  ",2,18
"MULDER: I can't explain it either, but I know someone who might be able to.  ",2,18
MULDER: Excuse me? Miss Ambrose? May we have a word with you?  ,2,18
MULDER: Is this where you keep Sophie?  ,2,18
MULDER: You think we could meet her? We're not here to try to take her away from you.  ,2,18
MULDER: Did you ask her why?  ,2,18
MULDER: What'd she say?  ,2,18
"MULDER: It's basic investigative procedure, Agent Scully - interview all possible witnesses.  ",2,18
MULDER: Are these Sophie's?  ,2,18
MULDER: What do you think they mean?  ,2,18
MULDER: Have you tried to mate her?  ,2,18
MULDER: Do you have a veterinary facility here?  ,2,18
"MULDER: All right, this may seem like a rather strange request but it might help explain what's been going on here. I'm gonna need your help on this, too, Scully.  ",2,18
MULDER: I'm pretty sure of what we're gonna find.  ,2,18
"MULDER: And the next thing you know, they'll be doing it on MTV Sports.  ",2,18
MULDER: I've been told there's never been a successful pregnancy at the Fairfield Zoo.  ,2,18
"MULDER: Well, is it true?  ",2,18
MULDER: Why then?  ,2,18
MULDER: But a perfect failure rate?  ,2,18
MULDER: Was an attempt ever made to mate Ganesha?  ,2,18
MULDER: Neither is an invisible elephant.  ,2,18
"MULDER: Whatever it is it's been going on for some time, and I think you'll find evidence of the same thing when your tiger returns.  ",2,18
"MULDER: I don't know, but we better find it before Meecham does.  ",2,18
MULDER: I'm sorry.  ,2,18
MULDER: You mean for Sophie?  ,2,18
MULDER: Agent Scully just finished the test. The tiger had been pregnant too.  ,2,18
MULDER: What if they've been artificially inseminated?  ,2,18
MULDER: Unless it was done somewhere else.  ,2,18
MULDER: What do you know about alien abduction?  ,2,18
"MULDER: I don't know where they're being taken but there's obviously some problem getting them back. Due to what is probably an astrological variation, a trouble with the time-space continuum - these animals that are being taken from locked cages are being returned roughly two miles westsouthwest of the zoo.  ",2,18
"MULDER: Yes, and harvesting the embryos.  ",2,18
"MULDER: Maybe their own Noah's ark? To preserve the DNA of these animals that we're depleting to extinction. Whatever it is, that's probably the reason why you've never had a successful birth at this facility.  ",2,18
MULDER: I understand that you might think it's ridiculous. Maybe you should ask Sophie.  ,2,18
"MULDER: I believe she's pregnant, and she's afraid of them coming for her baby.  ",2,18
MULDER: What'd she say?  ,2,18
MULDER: Can I ask her a question?  ,2,18
MULDER: Will you ask her if she wants to leave here?  ,2,18
MULDER: What did she say?  ,2,18
"MULDER: Whatever you do, you can't leave Sophie here. Not if you want to protect her.  ",2,18
MULDER: Where did you get this?  ,2,18
"MULDER: It's a small world, after all.  ",2,18
"MULDER: Scully, can I talk to you for a second?  ",2,18
MULDER: Why do you say that?  ,2,18
MULDER: Yes.  ,2,18
"MULDER: I still am, but in this case, Willa's reactions are all wrong.  ",2,18
"MULDER: I think she knows where Sophie is, and Kyle Lang died because he knows what she's capable of.  ",2,18
MULDER: I think she'd do anything to protect that animal.  ,2,18
"MULDER: I think an examination of the body will give us a lot clearer picture of what happened last night. You do that, and I'll check out the warehouse.  ",2,18
"MULDER: Put it down, Ed. There's been enough violence, don't you think?  ",2,18
MULDER: Put down the gun and we'll talk about it.  ,2,18
"MULDER: (picks up the gun) Where is the animal, Ed?  ",2,18
MULDER: Okay. You show me where - we're gonna go there together. Come on.  ,2,18
MULDER: What's she doing?  ,2,18
MULDER: She's scared.  ,2,18
"MULDER: Okay, Ed. Well, you're going to have to save her. Take your tranquilizer gun. I'll be right behind you.  ",2,18
MULDER: You see her?  ,2,18
"MULDER: Hey, Meecham!  ",2,18
MULDER: I'm not gonna hurt you.  ,2,18
MULDER: Where's Sophie?  ,2,18
MULDER: Meecham.  ,2,18
MULDER: They took Sophie.  ,2,18
MULDER: Where's Willa?  ,2,18
MULDER: I got to talk to her.  ,2,18
MULDER: She's gone.  ,2,18
MULDER: It wasn't Ed. She tried to tell me something.  ,2,18
MULDER: What is that?  ,2,18
MULDER: What does it mean?  ,2,18
MULDER: That's her.  ,2,18
"MULDER: (voiceover) Willa Ambrose and Ed Meecham have been charged with manslaughter for the death of Kyle Lang. And though the courts will rule on this matter, and justice will be no doubt be served, the pall of a greater tragedy remains. The motives of the silent visitors who set these events in motion remain unclear. Could this be a judgement on a global rate of extinction that has risen to 1000 times its natural rate in this century? An act of alien conservation of animals we are driving hard toward oblivion? And if so, might it follow that our own fate and existence could finally be dependent upon the conservatorship of an extraterrestrial race? Or in the simple words of a creature whose own future is uncertain, will ""man save man?""  ",2,18
MULDER: Scully. Thanks for coming.  ,2,19
"MULDER: I didn't want to waste any time. A Navy destroyer escort, the USS Ardent, has been missing in the North Atlantic for the past 42 hours.  ",2,19
"MULDER: Yeah, there's been no radio contact, no distress signals picked up. Search planes and satellites haven't picked up anything either.  ",2,19
"MULDER: Well, that's what it looked like until last night. A Canadian trawler picked up 18 survivors.  ",2,19
MULDER: Only one of those survivors is still alive. He's been taken into the ICU under heavy security.  ,2,19
"MULDER: That's what I was hoping you could tell me. (they see a soldier guarding a door at the end of the hall) They won't let me in to see him, but because of your medical background, I was able to get you a clearance code. I want your opinion on this. His name is Harper, Lt. Richard Harper.  ",2,19
MULDER: Meet me back in my office when you're finished. Thank you. (he leaves)  ,2,19
MULDER: Did they let you in to see Lt. Harper?  ,2,19
MULDER: What do you mean?  ,2,19
"MULDER: I want to show you something, Scully. (he takes her to map on the bulletin board with a number of locations marked by pins) This was the course of the USS Ardent when she disappeared. Now, I've been tracking the points of departure and destination for each of these X-files. On December 12, 1949, a Royal Navy battleship disappeared between Leeds and Cape Perry. The sea was calm, the weather sunny. In 1963, at the height of the Cuban missile crisis, a fleet of Soviet minesweepers left from here for Havana. All 6 vessels vanished without a trace. All in all, I've counted 9 unexplained disappearances. Each of them passed through here - the 65th parallel.  ",2,19
"MULDER: It's more like a wrinkle in time, if Lt. Harper is any indication.  ",2,19
MULDER: You know anything about the Philadelphia Experiment?  ,2,19
MULDER: Except none of those scientists ever made it to Los Alamos.  ,2,19
"MULDER: Roswell, New Mexico.  ",2,19
"MULDER: Less than nine months after the alleged crash of a UFO in Roswell, New Mexico, the USS Eldridge did more than just hide from radar screens, it disappeared altogether from the Philadelphia Navy Yard only to reappear minutes later, hundreds of miles away, in Norfolk Virginia.  ",2,19
MULDER: Those physicists may have been trying to manipulate wormholes on Earth.  ,2,19
MULDER: Actual portals where matter interfaces with time at a relatively decelerated or accelerated rate. I'm betting that the military never stopped the work it began 50 years ago.  ,2,19
MULDER: I'll find out soon enough. I'M BOOKED ON AN 8:30 flight to Norway.  ,2,19
MULDER: I'm giving myself a 24-hour head start before I give Skinner my report. I want this one myself.  ,2,19
MULDER: 0 for 5.  ,2,19
MULDER: How do you feel about the sea north of Beerenburg?  ,2,19
MULDER: So you've been there?  ,2,19
MULDER: A number of things. How good are you?  ,2,19
MULDER: When can we leave?  ,2,19
MULDER: Uhhh ... You're lucky you inherited your father's legs.  ,2,19
MULDER: His sea legs.  ,2,19
MULDER: (to Trondheim) It's been about 12 hours. You said it was only gonna take 10. What's going on?  ,2,19
MULDER: How much longer 'til we get there?  ,2,19
MULDER: The USS Ardent. It's a destroyer escort.  ,2,19
MULDER: Scully. (she comes over and looks) Let's check the crew quarters first.  ,2,19
MULDER: Like they've been dead a very long time.  ,2,19
MULDER: An engine.  ,2,19
MULDER: Hey!  ,2,19
MULDER: Hey!  ,2,19
MULDER: All right. (he makes an adjustment) Try it again.  ,2,19
MULDER: It's caked with the same residue that's covering everything.  ,2,19
MULDER: What we're seeing here may be the result of some kind of military experiment.  ,2,19
"MULDER: An artifical time band, where matter moves through time at an accelerated rate.  ",2,19
MULDER: Time may be speeding up.  ,2,19
MULDER: The ship ... the ship was launched in 1991. I don't know how else to explain the extent of the corrosion or the decay of the bodies down below.  ,2,19
MULDER: What happened?  ,2,19
MULDER: Who are you?  ,2,19
MULDER: Here you go.  ,2,19
MULDER: There's no way he killed Halverson.  ,2,19
MULDER: That means there's somebody else on board.  ,2,19
MULDER: Put it down! Put down the pipe! Put it down!  ,2,19
"MULDER: Back off, Trondheim!  ",2,19
MULDER: He may be our only chance to figure out what happened. Look at him. Look at him! He hasn't aged. Back off!  ,2,19
MULDER: You know him?  ,2,19
MULDER: Ask him how he got here.  ,2,19
"MULDER: We'll question him later. I don't want to leave Scully alone, in case there are others.  ",2,19
MULDER: I think we found who killed Halverson.  ,2,19
MULDER: Maybe we should ask the Captain some more questions.  ,2,19
MULDER: Is that what this substance is?  ,2,19
"MULDER: All right, we're all tired. Let's stow the captain's body and tie up Olafsson so we can all get some rest. I'll take first watch, in case he's not alone.  ",2,19
MULDER: Scully?  ,2,19
MULDER: You want a few more minutes?  ,2,19
MULDER: Scully ...  ,2,19
MULDER: Then theoretically it's possible. What else could it be?  ,2,19
"MULDER: We're the evidence, Scully! Look at us! We're aging by the minute.  ",2,19
"MULDER: Relax, relax, Trondheim. Save your energy.  ",2,19
MULDER: Nobody twisted your arm.  ,2,19
MULDER: Is this a quiz?  ,2,19
"MULDER: Grow old, you mean?  ",2,19
MULDER: So you think something is triggering that reaction in us?  ,2,19
"MULDER: It makes sense, Scully. The organic equivalent to rust would be rapid premature senescence.  ",2,19
"MULDER: It's not blood, Scully. It's rust. Trondheim, you keep an eye on Olafsson.  ",2,19
"MULDER: I'm not sure yet, but we don't have much time to get there.  ",2,19
MULDER: See this yellow pipe? It's the only one that hasn't corroded through.  ,2,19
MULDER: Olafsson and his men.  ,2,19
"MULDER: This is the only drinkable water on the ship. We were both wrong, Scully. It's the water. All the other water's been contaminated.  ",2,19
MULDER: Something must have gotten into the desalination tanks where all the ship's potable water is stored. But the water in the sewage system is recycled again and again. It doesn't come from the sea.  ,2,19
MULDER: (banging on the tank) The water from this tank may do the same for us.  ,2,19
MULDER: What happened? You were supposed to watch him.  ,2,19
MULDER: (angrily) I want to know what happened?  ,2,19
MULDER: There's nothing wrong with my knot! This rope's been severed!  ,2,19
MULDER: Let go of me.  ,2,19
"MULDER: It's the water, Trondheim. Something got into the de-sal tanks, but the water in the sewage system is untainted.  ",2,19
MULDER: I think I just lapped George Burns.  ,2,19
MULDER: You're almost out of pages. It's good you kept a record.  ,2,19
MULDER: You go ahead and drink it.  ,2,19
"MULDER: It's the only logical choice, Scully. You're a woman. Your life expectancy is greater, and your body retains more water in fatty tissues.  ",2,19
MULDER: You have a much greater chance of surviving until help comes.  ,2,19
"MULDER: Don't be so stubborn, Scully. You know I'm right.  ",2,19
MULDER: There might be.  ,2,19
"MULDER: The outer hull must have finally corroded through, which means we're taking on water.  ",2,19
"MULDER: I always thought when I got older I'd maybe take a cruise somewhere. This isn't exactly what I had in mind. The service on this ship is terrible, Scully. (she smiles) It's not fair. It's not our time. We still have work to do.  ",2,19
MULDER: I'm so tired.  ,2,19
"MULDER: This photo was taken at an amusement park three months ago. The young boy in the background is Teddy Holvey, aged two. (he points out Teddy, who is at the gate in the fence next to the tracks) He was killed just seconds after this was taken.  ",2,21
"MULDER: According to the police report, he wandered onto the tracks of the park's miniature train. The conductor was unable to stop due to a malfunction in the braking system. Teddy's father works for the State Department, so a coroner's inquest was held due to the unusual circumstances surrounding the accident.  ",2,21
"MULDER: No. No, but the County Medical Examiner called me afterwards. He was disturbed by this case and by this photograph, and I think with good reason. You see, this is a helium balloon here, and the one thing I did learn in kindergarten is when you let them go, they float up, up and away, but you see this is moving away from him, horizontally.  ",2,21
"MULDER: Well, I called the National Weather Service and they said on the day that Teddy died the wind was blowing north. But you see, the balloon is moving south, as if it's being pulled against the wind.  ",2,21
"MULDER: I don't know. That's why I came to Chuck, the king of digital imaging. Chuck can extract incredibly small details from a simple photographic print.  ",2,21
"MULDER: It all checked out, Scully. (hands her the camera) I think from the information here, this is clearly some kind of poltergeist activity.  ",2,21
"MULDER: (reaching for an evidence bag) In order to get on those tracks, Teddy Holvey had to escape this child-proof halter that his mother had tied to a bathroom sink.  ",2,21
"MULDER: So the C.M.E. took it home and put it on his own two-year-old and found it was physically impossible for the kid to reach around and free himself, so unless Teddy Holvey was the reincarnation of Houdini - and that would be an X-file in itself ...  ",2,21
MULDER: We're here apart from that investigation. We have reason to believe something may have been overlooked.  ,2,21
MULDER: The possibility Teddy may have been helped onto the tracks.  ,2,21
MULDER: Do you have any reason to suspect someone may have wanted to hurt Teddy?  ,2,21
"MULDER: Mrs. Holvey, did you hear anything in the bathroom right before Teddy disappeared?  ",2,21
"MULDER: Around the time of Teddy's death, had you noticed anything strange happening around the house, uh, things moved, odd objects appearing, anything like that?  ",2,21
MULDER: Ah ... does this happen often?  ,2,21
MULDER: You recognize this?  ,2,21
"MULDER: It's also known as a gammadion or a fylfot. It's an ancient symbol used for protection or good luck. It's been used by various cultures since the middle ages. The Holvey's child had one on the back of his hand last night. My guess it was drawn there by the old lady, to protect the boy.  ",2,21
MULDER: And you didn't think that was strange?  ,2,21
"MULDER: Yeah, my grandfather used to take that for his stomach.  ",2,21
MULDER: (reading the file) Projectile vomiting at three months. Diarrhea at four months. Vomiting ... diarrhea ... diarrhea.  ,2,21
MULDER: And no one questioned this?  ,2,21
"MULDER: Charlie had medical problems, too?  ",2,21
"MULDER: Do you feel like taking a walk over to the State Department, Scully? (she nods)  ",2,21
MULDER: What kind of strangeness?  ,2,21
MULDER: Afraid of him or for him?  ,2,21
"MULDER: Yeah, maybe.  ",2,21
MULDER: Yeah. It's everywhere. Look at this.  ,2,21
"MULDER: No, I checked the motor. It's working fine.  ",2,21
"MULDER: I don't know, but I'm gonna have this analyzed.  ",2,21
"MULDER: Uh, the courts are reluctant to intervene in these matters.  ",2,21
"MULDER: Really? You still think this is Munchausen by Proxy, Scully?  ",2,21
MULDER: I didn't do anything.  ,2,21
MULDER: Hey. You want to see something weird?  ,2,21
"MULDER: Chem-lab analysis of the ash from the Holvey's house. (he hands her a graph with a flat horizontal line) No trace of any metal, no carbon, no oxygen, no nothing.  ",2,21
"MULDER: It contains nothing organic or inorganic. In fact, according to the technicians, this ash doesn't exist. (grabs his coat) Come on.  ",2,21
MULDER: To get a second opinion.  ,2,21
"MULDER: Before Chuck succumbed to the glamours of academia, he did a tour of duty on the old hippie trail.  ",2,21
MULDER: That energy could have been what set off the garage door opener.  ,2,21
"MULDER: Well, who are you suggesting did that?  ",2,21
MULDER: The old lady ... and Charlie.  ,2,21
MULDER: What happened?  ,2,21
MULDER: Did you talk to Charlie?  ,2,21
"MULDER: Well, there was more ash on the floor under the old woman's body, and look at this. (hands her the glass container)  ",2,21
MULDER: It's mugwort. I think it's a ceremonial herb.  ,2,21
MULDER: No. The reverse swastika on the window and the red string around Charlie's wrist - those are protective devices.  ,2,21
"MULDER: I don't know, but I think the old woman knew the family was in trouble, and those men were here doing a ritual to help her.  ",2,21
MULDER: Who are they?  ,2,21
MULDER: Excuse me.  ,2,21
"MULDER: Sir? Can I have a word with you? Sir, I'm with the FBI. I'd like to ask you some questions.  ",2,21
"MULDER: You were trying to protect the family, weren't you? You said there was still evil here. Sir? (grabs the head Calusari by the arm as he reaches the car) I can arrest you if I have to.  ",2,21
"MULDER: Mrs. Holvey? I know this is a difficult time, but there are some questions that need to be answered.  ",2,21
MULDER: Do you know what kind of ceremony she was performing upstairs?  ,2,21
"MULDER: What secret, Mrs. Holvey? What are you talking about?  ",2,21
MULDER: How's Charlie?  ,2,21
"MULDER: I'm amazed she hasn't broken down completely. She's in the waiting room, trying to get some sleep.  ",2,21
MULDER: What are you looking at?  ,2,21
MULDER: Where?  ,2,21
MULDER: Are you all right?  ,2,21
MULDER: You gotta get to Mrs. Holvey's house.  ,2,21
MULDER: That boy you saw leaving with Mrs. Holvey - that wasn't Charlie.  ,2,21
"MULDER: A spirit, a ghost - I'm not sure but it's what we saw in the photograph. It's what the old woman was trying to protect the family from.  ",2,21
"MULDER: Whatever it is, it's killed three people, and you've got to get to Mrs. Holvey's before it happens again.  ",2,21
MULDER: Get help.  ,2,21
"MULDER: Scully, you all right?  ",2,21
MULDER: (voiceover) The strange case of Charlie Holvey and the deaths that occurred during his possession by a dark and malevolent force are unsolved ...  ,2,21
"MULDER: (voiceover) ... The boy, who will celebrate his tenth birthday next month, remains under the watchful care of his mother. And though I believe him innocent of the crimes, I am disturbed by the warnings of the Calusari that neither innocence nor vigilance may be protection against the howling heart of evil.  ",2,21
MULDER: I don't think the guards are watching enough prison movies.  ,2,22
MULDER: I thought this was about escaped prisoners.  ,2,22
MULDER: Then who are the men in the funny suits?  ,2,22
MULDER: Excuse me?  ,2,22
MULDER: No.  ,2,22
"MULDER: Oh, we'd be happy to as soon as we can talk to someone in charge.  ",2,22
MULDER: Apparently not or you'd know why our involvement was requested.  ,2,22
"MULDER: Where did this case originate, Scully?  ",2,22
MULDER: Did he say why he gave it to us?  ,2,22
"MULDER: Well, this isn't the type of thing the F.B.I. normally gets called in on. I got a feeling we're not being told the entire story here.  ",2,22
MULDER: Do you think you could get in there and find out what's going on?  ,2,22
MULDER: To see if I can get in the way.  ,2,22
MULDER: Mulder.  ,2,22
MULDER: What did you find?  ,2,22
MULDER: Deadly? How deadly?  ,2,22
"MULDER: Well, is there a chance any of the escaped men were infected?  ",2,22
MULDER: I'd say these guys are a danger in any event.  ,2,22
MULDER: We've got a man down! He's alive.  ,2,22
"MULDER: Kid's got a lot of hair, probably absorbed the blow. He found one of the men in pain on the bathroom floor with a large boil on his face.  ",2,22
MULDER: Any idea where they're headed?  ,2,22
"MULDER: Either of these guys got a girlfriend, you know?  ",2,22
"MULDER: Well, if they had girlfriends, they'd probably try to call them. You think of that?  ",2,22
MULDER: I'm a federal agent assisting in a manhunt for two escaped prisoners. My badge number is J-T-T-o-four-seven-one-o-one-one-one-one. I need to know the last call made from this booth.  ,2,22
"MULDER: Can you repeat that, please?  ",2,22
"MULDER: What's going on here, what's going on?  ",2,22
MULDER: Who are you?  ,2,22
MULDER: No!  ,2,22
"MULDER: I don't know, but there was a call made from that phone booth about two hours bago. I got an address and phone number from Dinwittie County.  ",2,22
MULDER: Yeah.  ,2,22
"MULDER: Uh, it's one of, if not the biggest manufacturer of drugs in America. Why?  ",2,22
MULDER: Any idea what was in the package?  ,2,22
"MULDER: Scully, from the description we got, one of the prisoners had a large, purple-ish inflammation on his face.  ",2,22
"MULDER: Yeah, it could spread. I, I, I need to know more about it.  ",2,22
MULDER: We've got one dead prisoner in the bedroom. The other one's gone.  ,2,22
"MULDER: Thank you for seeing me at this late hour, sir.  ",2,22
"MULDER: This case we've been assigned, I believe we've been misled, possibly decieved.  ",2,22
MULDER: Whoever originated the case.  ,2,22
MULDER: That Agent Scully and I were sent on this manhunt without knowledge of the existence or nature of a contagion.  ,2,22
MULDER: It's deadly. It kills within thirty-six hours. One escaped convict was infected. He's dead now. The other man may be infected and he's on the loose.  ,2,22
"MULDER: No, we just know that over a dozen men have died from it and it appears to be highly contagious.  ",2,22
MULDER: Why weren't we told the truth?  ,2,22
MULDER: But innocent people could be infected! What you knew could have prevented that.  ,2,22
MULDER: You can't protect the public by lying to them.  ,2,22
MULDER: I won't be a party to it.  ,2,22
MULDER: Mulder.  ,2,22
MULDER: What?  ,2,22
MULDER: Do you have proof of that?  ,2,22
"MULDER: Okay, listen, Scully. I need to know how this happened. I want you to start documenting everything you can get your hands on.  ",2,22
MULDER: It's a public health crisis.  ,2,22
"MULDER: Yeah, but what if he is?  ",2,22
MULDER: What if someone dies because we witheld what we knew?  ,2,22
"MULDER: Are you okay in there, Scully?  ",2,22
"MULDER: Elizabeth? My name is Fox Mulder, I'm with the F.B.I. Where did Paul go, Elizabeth?  ",2,22
MULDER: I think you do know.  ,2,22
MULDER: Steve felt fine too. Didn't take long for that to change.  ,2,22
"MULDER: You should be scared. If I were you, I'd be scared.  ",2,22
"MULDER: No, Paul is the one who is lying and if he's infected, a lot of people are going to die.  ",2,22
MULDER: That's not my decision.  ,2,22
"MULDER: Elizabeth, Paul is out there somewhere. I have to find him. Now, you can help me... or not.  ",2,22
"MULDER: No! No, they don't know what they're dealing with. If he's infected, he could spread it. What we need know is control.  ",2,22
MULDER: He's here. He bought a ticket to Toronto.  ,2,22
MULDER: And he's infected.  ,2,22
MULDER: Mulder.  ,2,22
"MULDER: You okay, Scully?  ",2,22
"MULDER: Yeah, he's headed to Toronto.  ",2,22
MULDER: But he's infected. He's going to die.  ,2,22
MULDER: Hold your men back.  ,2,22
MULDER: I'm getting on the bus.  ,2,22
"MULDER: There are other passangers on board. The prisoner sees a uniform, he could panic. He panics and innocent people die.  ",2,22
"MULDER: I get on the bus, I take the seat directly behind the prisoner, I put my gun to his head, I make an announcement to clear the bus.  ",2,22
MULDER: There's supposed to be a man on the bus.  ,2,22
MULDER: Take the key out of the ignition and turn around slowly.  ,2,22
MULDER: I'm with the F.B.I. I need to know if this man has boarded the bus.  ,2,22
MULDER: Federal agent! Drop your weapon!  ,2,22
MULDER: Let the boy go!  ,2,22
"MULDER: You got over two dozen U.S. marshalls out there, Paul. How far you gonna get?  ",2,22
"MULDER: The question is, how many people are you going to take with you?  ",2,22
MULDER: You were infected in prison.  ,2,22
MULDER: And your girlfriend Elizabeth and possibly your son.  ,2,22
MULDER: You saw a package?  ,2,22
"MULDER: All right, everybody, off the bus.  ",2,22
"MULDER: Robert Torrence was patient zero, the first prisoner to contract the disease. Just before being admitted to the infirmary, he received a package from Pinck Pharmaceuticals. They orchestrated this entire thing to circumvent years of F.D.A. trials in order to get their drug on the market.  ",2,22
MULDER: Because I wanted you to hear it from me before you read it in the papers.  ,2,22
MULDER: The public has a right to know so it doesn't happen again.  ,2,22
"MULDER: Eighteen people are dead, and if you're helping them cover the truth behind those deaths, then you're just as guilty as they are.  ",2,22
MULDER: I thought I was dealing with you.  ,2,22
MULDER: What are you talking about?  ,2,22
"MULDER: That's why we were given this assignment, right? They knew all along... so that even if we succeeded in finding the truth, we'd be discredited as part of it. Am I right?  ",2,22
"MULDER: Well, what about you, where do you stand?  ",2,22
MULDER: Who's your contact?  ,2,23
MULDER: Hello.  ,2,23
MULDER: (to Scully) We'll talk later.  ,2,23
MULDER: How do you know he's missing?  ,2,23
"MULDER: (sniffing the drink on the nightstand) Hmm, scotch. It looks like he barely touched it.  ",2,23
MULDER: Windows?  ,2,23
MULDER: You never know. You guys turn up any forensics evidence at all?  ,2,23
"MULDER: Scully, look at this.  ",2,23
MULDER: Did you run a test on it?  ,2,23
MULDER: Does this look like an arm to anybody?  ,2,23
"MULDER: This burn mark, it's right where I'd be if I were standing here answering the door, right?  ",2,23
"MULDER: And I wouldn't be looking out the peephole unless there was something to look at, right?  ",2,23
"MULDER: Detective Ryan, can you have this bulb dusted for prints?  ",2,23
MULDER: And can you run those against Mr. Newirth's. Do you have Mr. Newirth's prints?  ,2,23
"MULDER: OK, can you check those against all hotel employees and registered guests?  ",2,23
"MULDER: Yeah, do you have the name of the last missing person?  ",2,23
"MULDER: Thanks, that should do it. Is this your first case, Detective?  ",2,23
MULDER: Any idea why they gave it to you?  ,2,23
"MULDER: Well, don't be so sure about that.  ",2,23
MULDER: At first blush? Spontaneous human combustion.  ,2,23
MULDER: What are you talking about?  ,2,23
MULDER: I have over a dozen case files of human bodies reduced to ash without any attendant burning or melting. Rapid oxidation without heat.  ,2,23
MULDER: (flippantly) OK.  ,2,23
"MULDER: Hey, Scully, can you spare a prophylactic?  ",2,23
"MULDER: What are the odds of that, huh?  ",2,23
MULDER: Check this out. My newest tool in the fight against crime - $49.95 at your local hardware store.  ,2,23
MULDER: What do we know about the victim?  ,2,23
"MULDER: Yeah, but half of Richmond earns their paycheck making cancer sticks. It's just a coincidence.  ",2,23
MULDER: I don't know.  ,2,23
"MULDER: Ah, look at this, Scully. Someone forgot to empty the trash. M. Wysnecki, round trip to Hampton Roads, Virginia, return train dated March 17.  ",2,23
"MULDER: Patrick Newirth came into town by train, didn't he?  ",2,23
MULDER: Maybe that was a detail that was overlooked.  ,2,23
"MULDER: Maybe these people aren't just disappearing, maybe they're being hunted. And the hunter is working the train station.  ",2,23
MULDER: Maybe it's not so spontaneous. Get on the phone to your young detective and tell her to get a detail down to the train station.  ,2,23
MULDER: Nothing else?  ,2,23
MULDER: The prints you pulled from that light bulb ...  ,2,23
MULDER: Not yet.  ,2,23
"MULDER: He was here, Scully, I was right about that.  ",2,23
MULDER: Maybe with enough to identify the killer.  ,2,23
MULDER: He was here last night. He was also probably here on March 17 and March 31.  ,2,23
MULDER: That leaves us with 3 days of train station videotapes to cross-reference and hopefully find out who this guy is.  ,2,23
"MULDER: Either way, the security camera's our only witness.  ",2,23
MULDER: Let's go back to the terminal tape.  ,2,23
MULDER: He's got to be on at least one of these tapes.  ,2,23
"MULDER: See, this guy. Right here. He's always here. What's he doing?  ",2,23
MULDER: Why's he doing that?  ,2,23
MULDER: Can you freeze this and blow it up 200 percent?  ,2,23
"MULDER: OK, can you reframe and blow it up some more? He's got something on his jacket right there.  ",2,23
MULDER: Polarity Magnetics.  ,2,23
MULDER: March 22. Do you know him?  ,2,23
MULDER: How's that?  ,2,23
MULDER: Which was what?  ,2,23
MULDER: Powered by what?  ,2,23
MULDER: Look at this!  ,2,23
MULDER: Like getting an X-ray.  ,2,23
"MULDER: What do you think, Scully?  ",2,23
MULDER: I'm less convinced of that now.  ,2,23
"MULDER: I don't know. Whatever it is, it's connected to the person of Dr. Chester Ray Banton, maybe even part of him.  ",2,23
MULDER: I know of one place to start looking.  ,2,23
"MULDER: On the videotape, Dr. Banton kept staring at the floor. I've been trying to figure out what he might have been looking at.  ",2,23
MULDER: You trying to tell me something?  ,2,23
MULDER: Did you tell her about Dr. Banton's accident?  ,2,23
MULDER: Like?  ,2,23
"MULDER: What if, Dr. Banton ... look here, there are hardly any shadows cast.  ",2,23
MULDER: The lighting in here is diffused. It's soft light. What if that was what Banton was looking for?  ,2,23
MULDER: Dr. Banton!  ,2,23
MULDER: Stop right there! Dr. Banton!  ,2,23
"MULDER: We're federal agents, Dr. Banton.  ",2,23
MULDER: I thought the orders were to keep this patient in the dark.  ,2,23
MULDER: We're trying to understand.  ,2,23
MULDER: Can you tell us how?  ,2,23
MULDER: You have no control over it?  ,2,23
MULDER: They?  ,2,23
MULDER: The brain suck? For the purpose of ...  ,2,23
"MULDER: But if they killed you, then wouldn't your shadow just ...  ",2,23
MULDER: We caught the guy.  ,2,23
MULDER: Really? Have you talked to Dr. Banton?  ,2,23
"MULDER: I don't think you know anything about this case, which is why you stuck it with Detective Ryan. And I think you should allow her to decide how to proceed.  ",2,23
MULDER: Transferred? Where?  ,2,23
MULDER: I don't think you fully appreciate this man's condition or the danger that he poses.  ,2,23
MULDER: (to Ryan) Soft light. He needs soft light.  ,2,23
"MULDER: Hope you know what you're doing, Scully.  ",2,23
MULDER: Putting Detective Ryan's ambition ahead of all good sense in this case.  ,2,23
"MULDER: The difference is you never put yourself ahead of your work, and that's what happening here.  ",2,23
"MULDER: And as a favor, we just handed over the A-bomb over to the Boy Scouts.  ",2,23
"MULDER: And I'm sure that Robert Oppenheimer got similar reassurances from his government, the same government that Dr. Banton is afraid of.  ",2,23
"MULDER: That man is scared, and it's not just of his own shadow.  ",2,23
"MULDER: We've both seen the physical evidence, Scully.  ",2,23
MULDER: I think I do.  ,2,23
MULDER: Dr. Chester A. Banton. Do you know him?  ,2,23
"MULDER: He's being held by the Richmond Police in connection with several bizarre murders. He's a physicist, researching quarks, gluons, dark matter. He believes the government is out to get him.  ",2,23
MULDER: He believes his life is in danger.  ,2,23
MULDER: Yes.  ,2,23
"MULDER: At the Yaloff Psychiatric Hospital, but not for long.  ",2,23
MULDER: Why?  ,2,23
"MULDER: Yes, I know, and you can trust them as you trust me. I promise.  ",2,23
MULDER: (softly) Promise.  ,2,23
"MULDER: What'd you find out, Scully?  ",2,23
"MULDER: According to the floor nurse, there were three men.  ",2,23
MULDER: Somebody who would have access to plans for Virginia Power so they could take it off the grid without affecting surrounding facilities.  ,2,23
"MULDER: Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you, Scully, but my guess is he was unsuccessful and Dr. Banton is on the loose.  ",2,23
MULDER: I saw her leave.  ,2,23
"MULDER: Well, maybe that was an appointment he was never meant to keep. Let's go.  ",2,23
MULDER: You heard what Dr. Banton said last night.  ,2,23
"MULDER: Put yourself in his head, Scully. I think the only reason he hasn't tried to kill himself is because he's afraid his death will release the dark matter.  ",2,23
"MULDER: Whether or not Dr. Banton is actually telling the truth, he believes he is.  ",2,23
"MULDER: All that he's been trying to do since the accident is try to control this thing. Now if he's escaped, he's going to go to the one place where he thinks he can do that, and we've got to get there first.  ",2,23
MULDER: I was afraid of this.  ,2,23
"MULDER: (looking at the mark) Oh, damn it!  ",2,23
MULDER: The accelerator.  ,2,23
"MULDER: Scully, look at this.  ",2,23
MULDER: He couldn't have. This chamber's been sealed from the outside. (he slaps the door)  ,2,23
MULDER: You lied to me.  ,2,23
"MULDER: About Chester Ray Banton. You knew who he was, and you used me to lead you to him.  ",2,23
"MULDER: I won't be your stalking horse, or the government's.  ",2,23
MULDER: (angrily) You killed Dr. Banton!  ,2,23
MULDER: A nurse at the hospital identified you! A young detective is dead because of you! Who do you answer to?  ,2,23
"MULDER: All right, promise me something right now. Promise me this will be our last meeting. We're finished.  ",2,23
MULDER: How you doing?  ,2,23
MULDER: I know it must be hard.  ,2,23
"MULDER: I'm sorry I'm late, I got hung up at the Richmond PD.  ",2,23
MULDER: A missing person report was filed this morning by a Dr. Morris West. He's a physicist affiliated with Polarity Magnetics.  ,2,23
MULDER: The missing person was Dr. Christopher Davey. He hasn't been seen or heard from since Banton disappeared.  ,2,23
MULDER: No. None.  ,2,23
"MULDER: I've been wondering, what if it wasn't Banton we saw in the particle accelerator?  ",2,23
"MULDER: I dont know, Scully, the mans vanished. He hasnt been seen or heard from in ten weeks.  ",2,24
"MULDER: Chicken chase. (SCULLY looks at him questioningly) George Kearns was a federal poultry inspector assigned to Dudley, Arkansas, home of  Chaco Chicken.  ",2,24
"MULDER: They may ""think"" they are, but on the night George Kearns disappeared a woman on the I-10 saw a strange fire in an adjacent field.  ",2,24
MULDER: Folktales dating back to the 19th century from the Ozarks describe people being taken away by fireballs. It's supposed to be the spirits of massacred Indians.  ,2,24
"MULDER: Well, most legends don't leave behind 12-foot burn marks. (hands her a photo of a field with a large burned circle) That photo was taken by state police in the field where the woman claims to have seen foxfire.  ",2,24
MULDER: I thought so too. Until I remembered this. (crosses to TV) It's a documentary I saw when I was in college about an insane asylum. Gave me nightmares.  ,2,24
"MULDER: Unh, I was young.  ",2,24
"MULDER: (stopping tape) His name was Creighton Jones. He pulled off the road on May 17, 1961 to take a nap. They found him three days later so deranged by what he'd encountered that he had to be committed. The state police found his car on the I-10 right in the middle of Dudley, Arkansas,  home of Chaco Chicken.  ",2,24
MULDER: That's a witch's peg. Staking it into the ground is supposed to ward off evil spirits.  ,2,24
MULDER: We're with the FBI. Im Special Agent Mulder. This is Agent Scully. Were investigating the disappearance of George Kearns.  ,2,24
MULDER: Why didn't you mention this witch's peg in your report?  ,2,24
MULDER: What about the scorched area?  ,2,24
MULDER: So you dont believe its foxfire?  ,2,24
MULDER: (looking at folder) This inspection report-- your husband was about to file it with the Department of Agriculture the day before he disappeared.  ,2,24
MULDER: He never discussed his work with you?  ,2,24
"MULDER: Well, he cited several major health violations. He was gonna recommend that the plant be shut down.  ",2,24
MULDER: Let me give you my phone number. If your husband tries to contact you I want you to get in touch with me. Or if you can think of anything else.  ,2,24
MULDER: Whats that?  ,2,24
MULDER: Chickens feed on chickens?  ,2,24
"MULDER: If the fool would persist in his folly, he would become wise, Scully.  ",2,24
MULDER: Im not so sure about that.  ,2,24
MULDER: : Let him go. Were federal agents  ,2,24
"MULDER: What about you, Dr. Randolph? Do you have any ideas?  ",2,24
MULDER: But you can tell us whether George Kearns came to you with any similar complaints.  ,2,24
MULDER: Mr. Chaco?  ,2,24
"MULDER: It is, but we suspect that might have something to do with what happened to your granddaughter.  ",2,24
"MULDER: Were not sure yet, but it's possible they may have both suffered from the same neurological disorder.  ",2,24
MULDER: (looking in microscope) What am I looking at?  ,2,24
MULDER: Why didn't this show up on any of her charts?  ,2,24
MULDER: Could this be the reason she attacked Jess Harold?  ,2,24
MULDER: Is it fatal?  ,2,24
"MULDER: Except that Paula Gray was no girl. This is her personnel file, Scully. Check it out. It says here that Paula Gray was born in 1948, which means that this woman-- Chacos granddaughter-- was 47 years old.  ",2,24
"MULDER: Let's find out. Her birth certificate should be on file at the Seth County courthouse. Who knows, Scully? This could be *even* more interesting than foxfire.  ",2,24
MULDER: A lot more likely than Paula Gray being three years shy of her 50th birthday.  ,2,24
MULDER: Call an ambulance. Ill try to get the driver out.  ,2,24
MULDER: You're saying this is a third victim of Creutzfeldt-Jacob? You just got through telling me that two cases would be statistically impossible.  ,2,24
"MULDER: Ooh, Im listening.  ",2,24
MULDER: So anyone eating chickens out of Dudley would be at risk?  ,2,24
"MULDER: Yeah, but chickens from Dudley are shipped all over the country. If what youre saying were true, we'd be seeing an epidemic not just a few local cases.  ",2,24
MULDER: Sheriff Arens? What's wrong with this water?  ,2,24
MULDER: Was this river searched after George Kearns disappeared?  ,2,24
"MULDER: Well, Id like it dragged as soon as possible.  ",2,24
MULDER: To see what's in there.  ,2,24
MULDER: Hopefully nothing.  ,2,24
"MULDER: Look, Sheriff Arens, if you don't want to do it I can get some of my men down here to do it.  ",2,24
"MULDER: Oh, it's just a hunch. If George Kearns didnt run off, if he was murdered for that inspection report then his body's got to be somewhere.  ",2,24
MULDER: Did you find Kearns?  ,2,24
MULDER: Sheriff Arens is outside. They're still pulling bones from the river.  ,2,24
MULDER: How do you know?  ,2,24
MULDER: What about the others?  ,2,24
"MULDER: Well, they seem to have lost their heads.  ",2,24
MULDER: (looking) Its almost like theyve been polished.  ,2,24
MULDER: No. That water had hardly any current and this level of erosion wouldn't be confined to just the ends of the bones.  ,2,24
MULDER: Maybe.  ,2,24
"MULDER: I had Danny run a check on all missing persons last seen within a 200- mile radius of Dudley. In the last 50 years, 87 people have disappeared near here and, judging from the forensic evidence, Id say the same person or persons was responsible.  ",2,24
"MULDER: Scully, I think the good people of Dudley have been eating more than just chicken.  ",2,24
MULDER: Look at these bones. They've been polished at both ends suggesting they were boiled in a pot. Anthropologists have used similar evidence to prove cannibalism among the Anasazi tribe of New Mexico.  ,2,24
MULDER: That could begin to explain her youthful appearance.  ,2,24
MULDER: Some cannibalistic rituals are enacted with a belief that they can prolong life.  ,2,24
"MULDER: Think about it, Scully. From vampirism to Catholicism, whether literally or symbolically, the reward for eating flesh is eternal life. I dont claim to know how it works, but we both saw Paula Gray.  ",2,24
MULDER: The records at the courthouse should tell us how old she really is and if anybody else in Dudley is lying about their age. (at door) You coming?  ,2,24
MULDER: Someones been playing with matches.  ,2,24
MULDER: I bet its no coincidence it only hit the birth records.  ,2,24
MULDER: (on phone) Mulder.  ,2,24
MULDER: (on phone) Are you all right?  ,2,24
MULDER: (on phone) Who?  ,2,24
"MULDER: (on phone) All right, Mrs. Kearns, I want you to stay in the house and lock the door and dont answer the door until Agent Scully gets there. (hangs up)  ",2,24
MULDER: To take Chaco into custody.  ,2,24
MULDER: Is Mr. Chaco in?  ,2,24
MULDER: Do you know what's in here?  ,2,24
MULDER: Can you open it?  ,2,24
"MULDER: (on phone) Scully, Chacos not here.  ",2,24
MULDER: (on phone) Chaco must have taken her.  ,2,24
"MULDER: (on phone, voice) Scully? Scully! Scully! What happened? Scully! Are you there?  ",2,24
MULDER: (on phone) Are you all right? Answer me! SCULLY!!  ,2,24
MULDER: (softly) Are you hurt?  ,2,24
MULDER: You all right?  ,2,24
MULDER: What are you guys doing here.? ,2,25
MULDER: I'm not feeling well. I didn't sleep last night. I'm really not in the mood for the three stooges. ,2,25
MULDER: Who would follow you.? ,2,25
MULDER: Have you boys been defacing library books again.? ,2,25
MULDER: Kennith Suna. ,2,25
MULDER: What did he do.? ,2,25
MULDER: ( Paying attention ) What.? ,2,25
MULDER: What are you coming to me for.? ,2,25
MULDER: What happened.? ,2,25
MULDER: Sounds like a line I used in a bar once. ,2,25
MULDER: Why.? What've you got.? ,2,25
MULDER: Everything.? ,2,25
MULDER: You've read them.? ,2,25
MULDER: What makes you think they know who you are.? ,2,25
MULDER: You know they always denied that these files even existed. What do you want from me.? ,2,25
MULDER: Come in and lock the door. ,2,25
MULDER: Are you familiar with the ten commandments Scully.? ,2,25
"MULDER: No. Just number 4, the one about obeying the sabbath, the part about where God made Heaven and Earth but didn't bother to tell anybody about his side projects. ",2,25
MULDER: The biggest lie of all.  ,2,25
MULDER: The Holy Grail. The original defense department files. Hard evidence that the government has known about the existance of extraterrestrials for over fifty years. ,2,25
MULDER: Your friendly neighborhood anarchist.  ,2,25
"MULDER: I dont believe this. This is just gibberish. ( He stands up and hits a pencil holder ). Damn it. I'm so sick of this crap, BS and double talk. I can't believe this. ",2,25
"MULDER: It's a joke Scully, it's a bad joke. ",2,25
MULDER: Well can you find out.? ,2,25
MULDER: Then find one of em. ( He goes to walk out ) ,2,25
MULDER: Yeah. I just haven't been sleeping.  ,2,25
MULDER: Sir. ,2,25
MULDER: About.? ,2,25
MULDER: Why.? Is this another jerk off assignment where I end up doing the government's dirty work.? ,2,25
MULDER: I don't know anything about that. ( He turns around ). ,2,25
MULDER: Oh. I took a pill. ,2,25
MULDER: I came home. I must be running a fever. Maybe it's the threat of being burnt at the stake. ,2,25
MULDER: What did you tell them.? ,2,25
MULDER: Well you told them the truth then. ,2,25
"MULDER: Okay, I'll say I'm sorry. ",2,25
MULDER: Why.? ,2,25
MULDER: How would they find out.? ,2,25
MULDER: I'll tell you when I find out what's on it. Now just tell me who I can talk to about breaking that code. ,2,25
MULDER: I'll try to find out.  ,2,25
MULDER: I've thought of that Scully. I honestly can't say.  ,2,25
MULDER: Mulder. ,2,25
MULDER: Where are you. ,2,25
MULDER: Dad. What is it.? ,2,25
MULDER: What choices.? Dad. ,2,25
MULDER: About what.? ,2,25
MULDER: You're talking about your work in the state department. ,2,25
MULDER: What words.? ,2,25
MULDER: Dad.? Dad. Dad ( He hears tires screech ). Oh dad. ,2,25
MULDER: My father's dead Scully. ,2,25
MULDER: They shot him and he's dead. ,2,25
MULDER: I'm on the Vineyard. ,2,25
MULDER: I don't know. ,2,25
"MULDER: I didn't do it Scully, he was trying to tell me something. ",2,25
MULDER: You gotta believe me Scully. ,2,25
"MULDER: I can't leave the crime scene, it'll look like I'm running, make me look guilty. ",2,25
MULDER: He was shot with somebody else's weapon. ,2,25
MULDER: All right. Meet me back at my apartment. ,2,25
MULDER: I'm okay. ,2,25
MULDER: You gotta find them Scully. ,2,25
MULDER: We gotta find out who killed my father. ,2,25
MULDER: Scully. (He looks for his gun).  ,2,25
MULDER: You took my gun. You think I did it don't you.? ,2,25
MULDER: Well why didn't you ask me.? ,2,25
MULDER: What were you afraid that I was gonna shoot you too.? ,2,25
"MULDER: So you can clear your conscience and your name?! You've been making reports on me since the beginning Scully, taking your little notes! ",2,25
MULDER: Look you have my files and you have my gun. Don't ask me for my trust. ,2,25
MULDER: I'm gonna kill you anyway Krycek so you may as well tell me the truth. Did you kill my father.? Did you kill him... answer me. ( Mulder punches him ). ,2,25
MULDER: He killed my father Scully. ,2,25
MULDER: No Scully...  ,2,25
MULDER: You shot me. ,2,25
MULDER: Why'd you shoot me? He's the one. ,2,25
MULDER: What are you talking about.? ,2,25
MULDER: How'd you know it was Krycek.? ,2,25
MULDER: What is it.? ,2,25
MULDER: Oh my God. There was a murder in my building. ,2,25
MULDER: I'd gotten too close to the truth. Where are we.? ,2,25
MULDER: New Mexico.? ,2,25
MULDER: Or a bad one. ,2,25
MULDER: How'd you find him.? ,2,25
MULDER: What about you.? ,2,25
MULDER: You've taken a big risk. ,2,25
MULDER: Thank you. Thank you for taking care of me. ,2,25
MULDER: In what context.? ,2,25
MULDER: You said you knew I was coming. ,2,25
MULDER: But why me.? ,2,25
MULDER: I don't understand. ,2,25
MULDER: And what is the truth.? ,2,25
MULDER: You think they were abducted. ,2,25
MULDER: What's buried out there.? ,2,25
MULDER: Mulder. ,2,25
MULDER: Not hard enough apparently. ,2,25
"MULDER: I'm at the Betty Ford center, where are you.? ",2,25
"MULDER: I'll save the government the plane fare, I just need to know which government that is. ",2,25
"MULDER: Yeah, which things are those.? ",2,25
"MULDER: No, he couldn't live with it because you had him killed. ",2,25
"MULDER: Now listen to me you black lunged son of a bitch, I'm gonna expose you and your project, your time is over. ",2,25
MULDER: This is a boxcar.  ,2,25
"MULDER: Yeah, it's me. ",2,25
MULDER: Nowhere I ever expected. ,2,25
MULDER: I'm in a boxcar buried inside a quarry. There are bodies everywhere. ,2,25
MULDER: Stacked floor to ceiling. ,2,25
MULDER: I don't know. ,2,25
MULDER: What kind of experiments.? ,2,25
MULDER: But these aren't human Scully. From the look of it I'd say they were alien. ,2,25
MULDER: I'm pretty damn sure. Wait a sec...  ,2,25
MULDER: This one... has a smallpox vacination scar. ,2,25
"MULDER: Oh my God Scully, what have they done.?  ",2,25
MULDER: My sister? Is she here?  ,3,1
MULDER: That's really going to cut into my social life.  ,3,1
"MULDER: During my fever, I... I left here and traveled to a place.  ",3,1
MULDER: It wasn't a dream?  ,3,1
"MULDER: I have been on the bridge that spans two worlds, the link between all souls by which we cross into our own true nature. You were here today, looking for truth that was taken from you, a truth that was never to be spoken but which now binds us together in dangerous purpose. I have returned from the dead to continue with you... but I fear that this danger is now close at hand... that I may be too late.  ",3,1
MULDER: Mom?  ,3,1
"MULDER: I need your help, Mom, but I don't have much time.  ",3,1
MULDER: I'm okay but I need your help. I need you to remember.  ,3,1
MULDER: I need to know more about Dad.  ,3,1
"MULDER: I need you to try and remember, Mom. These pictures were taken in 1972. Where?  ",3,1
"MULDER: Dad was working for the state department, he'd go on the road. Where would he go?  ",3,1
"MULDER: Will you look at the pictures, Mom?  ",3,1
MULDER: Just look at them!  ,3,1
"MULDER: Now, he must have talked about his work, about the men he worked with. Did he ever bring them home? Were they ever here?  ",3,1
MULDER: I think it has to do with Samantha.  ,3,1
MULDER: Drop your weapon! I said...  ,3,2
MULDER: I said put it down!  ,3,2
"MULDER: You okay, Scully?  ",3,2
MULDER: Get his gun.  ,3,2
"MULDER: Now, I want an explanation.  ",3,2
"MULDER: Your cigarette-smoking friend killed my father for that tape, and then he killed me.  ",3,2
"MULDER: I was a dead man. Now, I'm back.  ",3,2
MULDER: Defense department files that weren't supposed to exist. The truth about our government's involvement in a global conspiracy of silence about the existence of extraterrestrial life.  ,3,2
MULDER: Give her the tape.  ,3,2
MULDER: Then you better make sure it doesn't.  ,3,2
MULDER: There are truths out there that aren't on that tape.  ,3,2
"MULDER: Scully, whatever you're going to say...  ",3,2
MULDER: How did you know?  ,3,2
MULDER: That's my father on the left there.  ,3,2
MULDER: About 1973.  ,3,2
MULDER: Our deal with the devil. The U.S. government provided safe haven for certain Nazi war criminals in exchange for their scientific knowledge.  ,3,2
MULDER: I don't know. Do you recognize anybody else in the photograph?  ,3,2
"MULDER: You're going to have to wait a little longer for my video collection, Frohike.  ",3,2
MULDER: Scully...  ,3,2
MULDER: You can't go.  ,3,2
"MULDER: If they're trying to kill you, that's the first place they're going to look.  ",3,2
MULDER: We're going to call someone I think can help. It's the only thing you can do for her right now is try to crucify them.  ,3,2
MULDER: Victor Klemper?  ,3,2
"MULDER: My name is Fox Mulder, this is Dana Scully.  ",3,2
MULDER: Yes. I think you knew my father.  ,3,2
"MULDER: When you came to this country, you did some work for our government.  ",3,2
MULDER: Like my father. They killed him and I believe you know why.  ,3,2
"MULDER: Well, what is this ""work"" that my father was involved in?  ",3,2
"MULDER: Well, you knew him! Was he a murderer too?  ",3,2
"MULDER: No, I need to know! I need to know the truth! Isn't that what you want? For the truth to be known?  ",3,2
"MULDER: Let's go, Scully.  ",3,2
MULDER: I don't know. He never came home wearing a miner's cap.  ,3,2
"MULDER: I'd like to try door number one, Monty.  ",3,2
MULDER: Sure that's the right number?  ,3,2
"MULDER: I think with a crowbar and a small nuclear device, I might be able to get through one of these things.  ",3,2
"MULDER: I'm okay, Scully...  ",3,2
MULDER: Of what?  ,3,2
MULDER: Lots of files.  ,3,2
MULDER: What's in these files?  ,3,2
MULDER: What is this?  ,3,2
MULDER: Do all these files contain the same materials?  ,3,2
MULDER: What year was this person born?  ,3,2
MULDER: What year were you born?  ,3,2
MULDER: Let's go find 1964.  ,3,2
"MULDER: ""Dana Katherine Scully.""  ",3,2
"MULDER: I don't know, Scully.  ",3,2
MULDER: Yeah.  ,3,2
MULDER: I don't know.  ,3,2
"MULDER: Wait here, Scully.  ",3,2
MULDER: Scully!  ,3,2
MULDER: Scully!  ,3,2
"MULDER: You okay, Scully?  ",3,2
MULDER: I've been looking for you.  ,3,2
MULDER: They got a small army outside. I think they got us trapped.  ,3,2
MULDER: You'd be surprised what's not on the map in this country and what our government will do to keep it that way.  ,3,2
"MULDER: Last night, we were chased by some kind of hit squad driving what looked an awful lot like C.I.A. fleet sedans.  ",3,2
"MULDER: No, sir. I need that tape. I need those files.  ",3,2
MULDER: And I'm talking about an elaborate conspiracy against the American public. Do you know what we found last night?  ,3,2
MULDER: Locked inside a mountain vault.  ,3,2
"MULDER: I don't know. But the answer's got to be on that tape, in those files.  ",3,2
MULDER: It's obviously worth killing us for.  ,3,2
MULDER: Why they killed my father... and what happened to my sister... and what they did to Agent Scully.  ,3,2
"MULDER: What makes you think there's any such thing as justice, Scully?  ",3,2
MULDER: What we found last night...  ,3,2
MULDER: I suppose you already tried to make a backup of the tape.  ,3,2
MULDER: What makes you think they'll even honor this deal?  ,3,2
"MULDER: It's up to you, Scully.  ",3,2
"MULDER: I'm sorry about your sister, Scully.  ",3,2
MULDER: Mister Klemper? Mister Klemper?  ,3,2
"MULDER: You killed him, didn't you?  ",3,2
MULDER: You were involved in this project. You know why the medical data was being collected.  ,3,2
MULDER: Klemper was trying to create an alien-human hybrid. That's what I saw in the boxcar. He was using human test subjects.  ,3,2
MULDER: My father was involved in this?  ,3,2
MULDER: He collected those files?  ,3,2
MULDER: The vaccination records. They took tissue from everyone who received a small pox inoculation.  ,3,2
MULDER: So that Victor Klemper had access to a DNA database of nearly everyone who was born since 1950.  ,3,2
"MULDER: Why was your file there, Scully?  ",3,2
MULDER: There were current records on file.  ,3,2
MULDER: Of abductions! Of abductees.  ,3,2
MULDER: Why her? Why not me?  ,3,2
MULDER: Why are you telling me this?  ,3,2
MULDER: Is there more?  ,3,2
MULDER: Yeah.  ,3,2
MULDER: It's after two.  ,3,2
MULDER: I needed to see you in person. I need to ask you something. I need to ask you about something that happened a long time ago.  ,3,2
"MULDER: Mom, listen to me. When Samantha... before she was gone, did Dad ever ask you if you had a favorite? Did he ever ask you that?  ",3,2
"MULDER: Mom, did he ever ask you to make a choice?  ",3,2
"MULDER: Mom, listen to me! I need to know! Did he make you make a choice?  ",3,2
"MULDER: Oh, she knows. Melissa knows.  ",3,2
"MULDER: I don't think this is about justice, Scully.  ",3,2
MULDER: I think it's about something we have no personal choice in. I think it's about fate.  ,3,2
MULDER: I feel the same way. We've both lost so much... but I believe that what we're looking for is in the X-Files. I'm more certain than ever that the truth is in there.  ,3,2
MULDER: Probably? (holding up plastic wrapped black heart) It looks like his heart was cooked right in his chest.  ,3,3
MULDER: Lightning.  ,3,3
MULDER: (smiles) Why? You were doing just fine.  ,3,3
MULDER: I just dont think its lightning.  ,3,3
MULDER: I dont know yet.  ,3,3
MULDER: (smiling again) None of the evidence so far indicates either of those possibilities.  ,3,3
MULDER: So Tellers explanation works for you?  ,3,3
"MULDER: Well, then this local lightening is a lot more predictable than Teller realizes. It seems to have a definite preference for the type of person it strikes.  ",3,3
"MULDER: Well, look at the files, look at all the other victims, theyre all male age 17 to 21, just like Jack Hammond. At least lets go see where Jack Hammond was killed. Maybe well find something we both can agree on.  ",3,3
MULDER: Looks like he was trying to get away in a big hurry.  ,3,3
MULDER: What time was Jack Hammonds last pizza delivery?  ,3,3
MULDER: All these stores would have been closed by 11:00 except maybe this one.  ,3,3
"MULDER: Look, Scully, take a look at this.  ",3,3
MULDER: What were the names of the other victims?  ,3,3
MULDER: (interrupting) Darren Oswald. Whats his middle name?  ,3,3
MULDER: (indicating highscores) DPO. Darren Peter Oswald. Of the five victims wasnt he the only one to survive?  ,3,3
"MULDER: Well, he was here last night.  ",3,3
MULDER: They say he was struck by lightning.  ,3,3
"MULDER: Right outside the video arcade. Not a cloud in the sky from what we can tell. You were there last night, werent you? Broke your own record too.  ",3,3
MULDER: You must have seen something.  ,3,3
MULDER: Can I ask you a personal question?  ,3,3
MULDER: Do you consider yourself a lucky person?  ,3,3
MULDER: Yeah.  ,3,3
"MULDER: Im just thinking about all the people that got hit by lightning, youre the only one to survive. Dont you think youre lucky?  ",3,3
MULDER: Yeah?  ,3,3
MULDER: I dont know. (drops it as it burns his fingers) It just got hot all of a sudden.  ,3,3
"MULDER: (sarcastically, nursing his hand) Thanks for your help.  ",3,3
MULDER: Lightning.  ,3,3
"MULDER: The Schuman Resonance. Eight cycles per second. You can pick it up on any transistor radio. (needling SHERIFF TELLER) You see that, Sheriff? I did my homework.  ",3,3
"MULDER: (looking at dead cow) Oh, thats certainly the way it looks.  ",3,3
MULDER: Looks like a fulgurite. That only happens with lightning  when sandy soil fuses into glass from the heat of a discharge.  ,3,3
MULDER: That were wasting our time chasing lightning?  ,3,3
MULDER: I dont know yet. (strains a little as he pulls the fulgurite out of the ground) This is the first lightning strike Ive ever seen that left behind a footprint.  ,3,3
MULDER: Thats great. Now can you make me a little cherub that squirts water?  ,3,3
"MULDER: (really impressed) 8½? Thats pretty impressive, Scully.  ",3,3
MULDER: (taking it from her) Oooo.  ,3,3
MULDER: (looks at vial she hands him) What is it?  ,3,3
MULDER: Darren Oswald.  ,3,3
"MULDER: I dont know, Scully, but lets go see if the shoe fits.  ",3,3
"MULDER: Can we have a few minutes, Mrs. Oswald? (She lets them into the bedroom and leaves.) Thank you.  ",3,3
MULDER: Yeah?  ,3,3
MULDER: (looking at centerfold) Eight ½?  ,3,3
"MULDER: (unashamed) Oh, I have. April is the cruelest month. But mine didnt come with this. I found that between Miss April and ""Women of the Ivy League."" (hands her cut out picture of SHARON KIVEAT.)  ",3,3
"MULDER: I dont know, but it looks like its from some kind of yearbook photo, see?  ",3,3
MULDER: Kiveat the garage where Darren works is called Kiveat Auto Body.  ,3,3
MULDER: Let me give you a hand with that.  ,3,3
MULDER: Mrs. Kiveat? My name is Fox Mulder. Im with the FBI. I know this is a hard time but Id like to ask you some questions.  ,3,3
MULDER: Yes.  ,3,3
"MULDER: Id like to ask you about Darren Oswald. He was at the scene of the accident, wasnt he?  ",3,3
MULDER: Why?  ,3,3
MULDER: How did he explain this?  ,3,3
MULDER: Ive been going over Oswalds chart. Theres something I want you to take a look at.  ,3,3
MULDER: Yeah. What is that?  ,3,3
"MULDER: Electrolytes, right?  ",3,3
MULDER: And what do electrolytes do?  ,3,3
"MULDER: Okay, its a leap, Scully, but what if Oswalds electrolyte imbalance is somehow enabling him to generate electricity at levels much higher than normal?  ",3,3
"MULDER: Unless his body is abnormally conductive. Because if that heel print is Oswalds, that means he conducted millions of volts of electricity into the ground and then just walked away.  ",3,3
"MULDER: No, Im saying that he *is* lightning and weve got to get to him before he strikes again.  ",3,3
MULDER: Darren. Darren! Darren (grabs his shoulder)  ,3,3
"MULDER: (hand up) Relax, Darren.  ",3,3
MULDER: What did he say?  ,3,3
MULDER: How did he say he revived Kiveat?  ,3,3
"MULDER: (quietly, just to SCULLY) I dont think he just resuscitated Frank Kiveat, Scully. I think he set the whole thing up.  ",3,3
MULDER: Did you see what he did to my phone?  ,3,3
"MULDER: I think we should run a full set of lab tests on this kid, Scully.  ",3,3
MULDER: I can think of only one other person that might be able to help us.  ,3,3
MULDER: Mrs. Kiveat.  ,3,3
"MULDER: Darren Oswalds in custody, Mrs. Kiveat. We arrested him this afternoon. But we cant press criminal charges without your help.  ",3,3
MULDER: When did you first suspect that Darren was involved in something more than prank calls?  ,3,3
MULDER: He actually confessed to killing those people?  ,3,3
MULDER: When was this?  ,3,3
MULDER: Jack Hammond?  ,3,3
MULDER: Did you tell anyone?  ,3,3
MULDER: Wheres Oswald?  ,3,3
MULDER: You released him? When?  ,3,3
MULDER: Ill go call Sharon Kiveat. (leaves quickly)  ,3,3
MULDER: Mrs. Kiveats not home.  ,3,3
"MULDER: (showing badge to a nurse) Excuse me, miss? Call security. Have them deny entry to the hospital to everyone except emergency personnel.  ",3,3
MULDER: Darren Oswald. He was released from custody.  ,3,3
MULDER: Ill stay with him. Go with Agent Scully.  ,3,3
MULDER: Hes here.  ,3,3
MULDER: (to SCULLY as he runs off) Stay with them.  ,3,3
MULDER: Im going after Oswald.  ,3,3
"MULDER: (yelling) Teller, get out of there!  ",3,3
MULDER: (sarcastic) Lightning? What about the scientists at the observatory? What do they have to say?  ,3,3
MULDER: What about the tests I asked for?  ,3,3
MULDER: And?  ,3,3
"MULDER:  Darren Oswald is a perfectly normal, perfectly healthy kid. You believe that, Scully? (she looks at him) Neither do I.  ",3,3
MULDER: I'm Agent Mulder.  ,3,4
"MULDER: Satanists take the eyeballs and leave the body, not vice-versa. Not in anything but modern myths.  ",3,4
MULDER: Anthropomancy. It was once believed that you could divine your future by vivisecting a human being and studying the entrails.  ,3,4
MULDER: And an amateur tasseographer. She read tea leaves.  ,3,4
MULDER: I'm not convinced of its accuracy but I'm pretty sure the victim was.  ,3,4
MULDER: Her leaves were telling her she was about to be murdered.  ,3,4
MULDER: I'm part of this investigation.  ,3,4
"MULDER: I can assure you, Mister Yappi, I'm a believer in psychic ability.  ",3,4
"MULDER: Mister Yappi, read this thought.  ",3,4
"MULDER: Well, let me impress you with my psychic ability. Mister Yappi proclaimed the victim's body would be found near water, he saw a church or a school in the vicinity, he got a flash of the letter ""S"" and/or the number ""seven.""  ",3,4
"MULDER: Well, his leads are so vague as to be practically useless yet easily interpreted to be correct after the fact.  ",3,4
"MULDER: Yeah, and some are bound by percentages to be right but most will turn out wrong. Now, which is which?  ",3,4
"MULDER: Oooh, I just got a chill down my spine.  ",3,4
MULDER: How had the eyes been cut out?  ,3,4
"MULDER: We did find some crystal shards on the body, how do you know it was from a crystal ball?  ",3,4
"MULDER: Mister Bruckman? Sorry, Mister Bruckman, but I'm going to have to ask you to come with us.  ",3,4
"MULDER: Step inside, Mister Bruckman.  ",3,4
MULDER: A murder occurred here earlier this evening and we have reason to believe that it was committed by the same person who murdered the woman that you found.  ,3,4
MULDER: You're not under suspicion... but I do harbor a suspicion that you can see things about this crime... things that we can't see.  ,3,4
MULDER: I think you do.  ,3,4
MULDER: Pinch me.  ,3,4
"MULDER: No, something told me, Scully, something is telling me this guy's for real.  ",3,4
MULDER: Can you describe him? Do you get a visual impression of him?  ,3,4
MULDER: What is it? What do you see?  ,3,4
MULDER: Then what's wrong?  ,3,4
"MULDER: Mister Bruckman, can you tell us why the killer is murdering people in the way that he is?  ",3,4
"MULDER: Be honest, Scully. Doesn't that propane tank bear more than just a slight resemblance to a fat, little, white Nazi stormtrooper?  ",3,4
MULDER: Did you answer my question?  ,3,4
MULDER: He named the specific body of water the victim would be found in.  ,3,4
MULDER: I don't believe he's the killer.  ,3,4
"MULDER: Well, if he's not, then how did he know where the body would be found?  ",3,4
MULDER: Everything you said is correct.  ,3,4
MULDER: But you do admit to having this gift.  ,3,4
"MULDER: Mister Bruckman, you possess an ability that not only has staggering implications upon physics and human consciousness, but it's one which most people, myself included, would be envious of. Yet you seem to treat it with disdain.  ",3,4
"MULDER: Y, yes, I would.  ",3,4
"MULDER: Mister Bruckman, this murderer has already committed four homicides.  ",3,4
MULDER: How can you be so sure?  ,3,4
"MULDER: Then if the future is written, then why bother to do anything?  ",3,4
"MULDER: Mister Bruckman, I believe in your ability but not your attitude.  ",3,4
"MULDER: That's a hit. In psychical research parlance, a correct answer's a ""hit,"" an incorrect answer's a ""miss.""  ",3,4
MULDER: I have no way of verifying that information.  ,3,4
MULDER: Do you receive any other impressions from it?  ,3,4
"MULDER: I'm now convinced of our psychic's abilities, Scully, or rather, his one ability. He is able to divine how people are going to die but that's all. He can't provide any practical information on our case.  ",3,4
MULDER: Miss.  ,3,4
"MULDER: Save me the headache, Scully, what is it?  ",3,4
MULDER: Is that a hit or a miss?  ,3,4
MULDER: You got all that information just by handling that keychain?  ,3,4
MULDER: How are you receiving this information about the body's location?  ,3,4
"MULDER: I mean, are you seeing it in a vision or is it a... sensation? How do you know where to go?  ",3,4
MULDER: But how do you know?  ,3,4
MULDER: Why are you telling me that?  ,3,4
MULDER: Do you remember the first time you foresaw someone's death?  ,3,4
MULDER: What happened in 1959?  ,3,4
MULDER: I'm not following.  ,3,4
MULDER: I'm still not following.  ,3,4
"MULDER: Yeah, Mister Bruckman, I don't understand how you can know that this is the exact area, but you can't pinpoint the exact spot.  ",3,4
"MULDER: Okay, now.  ",3,4
MULDER: The only evidence recovered from Claude Dukenfield's body. That fiber may have come from something the killer was wearing at the time of the crime.  ,3,4
MULDER: But it'll take them time to provide any information. A similar fiber was found on one of the earlier victims and we're still waiting for the lab to determine it's source. You'd be saving us a great deal of work.  ,3,4
MULDER: Mister Bruckman... I can't speak for my partner but I'm desperate... for some insurance.  ,3,4
MULDER: Is he?  ,3,4
MULDER: Like what? What does he see?  ,3,4
MULDER IN VISION: Hey!  ,3,4
MULDER: Where does this take place?  ,3,4
"MULDER: Well, why don't I see him, what am I doing?  ",3,4
MULDER: What?  ,3,4
"MULDER: Whatever, please continue.  ",3,4
"MULDER: All right, I'm looking down at this banana cream pie and then what...  ",3,4
"MULDER: And? And, what does he see?  ",3,4
MULDER: You got all that from this?  ,3,4
"MULDER: ""To whom it may concern. Like our lives, this is a mere formality to let you know I know that you know. Can't wait till our first meeting when I kill you. Not before you explain some things to me. First on the list, why in the world did I send you this letter? Sincerely, you know who. P.S., say 'hi' to the F.B.I. agents.""  ",3,4
"MULDER: No, no, this letter is postmarked the day before Mister Bruckman joined our investigation. You're going to have to come with us, Mister Bruckman. We're got to get you out of here.  ",3,4
"MULDER: Get this, Scully. The lab analysis from the first bit of fiber that was found just came back. It's lace.  ",3,4
MULDER: You know what I like.  ,3,4
"MULDER: But what are the odds of the Big Bopper, ""Chantilly lace...""  ",3,4
"MULDER: If coincidences are just coincidences, why do they feel so contrived?  ",3,4
MULDER: Am I keeping you awake?  ,3,4
"MULDER: Well, I've had dreams in my life where I had a vision and then later on, I've seen that vision in reality and then... and as a psychic, have you ever had prophetic dreams like that?  ",3,4
"MULDER: No, no, I'm not a Freudian, no.  ",3,4
"MULDER: Oh, yeah. I just didn't sleep well. What's up?  ",3,4
"MULDER: I'm beginning to lose patience with our psychic, Scully. What good are his prophecies if they're not preventive?  ",3,4
"MULDER: So, you're convinced he's a psychic now?  ",3,4
"MULDER: Now, we've either got a copycat killer or our guy's getting extremely lackadaisical.  ",3,4
"MULDER: If my Miss Manners serves me right, that protrusion from his left cornea is a salad fork.  ",3,4
"MULDER: Ah, we've got more than that this time, Scully. We've got fingerprints, probably a footprint even.  ",3,4
MULDER: Woman's intuition.  ,3,4
MULDER: Hey!  ,3,4
MULDER: How'd you know where to find us?  ,3,4
MULDER: Thank heaven for happenstance.  ,3,4
MULDER: Then Bruckman is all right?  ,3,4
"MULDER: Well, then where is he?  ",3,4
"MULDER: ""Miss Scully.""  ",3,4
"MULDER: Napoleon ""Neech"" Manley. He was convicted in 1984 for double murder in the holdup of a Florida liquor store. The actual gunman was killed in the pursuit. Manley was driving the getaway car and got sentenced to death.  ",3,5
"MULDER: Yeah, he'd been to the chair twice before but the governor had granted him last-minute stays.  ",3,5
"MULDER: Well, Manley was interesting. He was well-read, charismatic. He became a writer, a kind of prison philosopher. A week before his execution, word went through the prison that Neech said he was gonna be reincarnated. He was gonna come back from the dead.  ",3,5
"MULDER: Apparently, this was more than just a dying man's hope against hope.  ",3,5
MULDER: Manley didn't just claim that he was gonna come back but that he was gonna take vengeance on five men who had mistreated him.  ,3,5
"MULDER: Yesterday, a death row guard was found dead inside the cell that Manley had occupied those 11 years. His death cannot be explained.  ",3,5
MULDER: Any idea how one of your guards could get murdered in an empty cell like this?  ,3,5
"MULDER: According to our reports, there were threats this might happen.  ",3,5
MULDER: Do you give any credence to Neech Manley's claims that he was gonna come back and take revenge?  ,3,5
MULDER: So you're saying that Manley planned this and is carrying it out with the help of someone else.  ,3,5
MULDER: Did Manley have many friends among the prisoners?  ,3,5
MULDER: I've been told you believe Neech Manley's claims.  ,3,5
"MULDER: What are you saying, Speranza? You believe Manley killed that guard?  ",3,5
MULDER: A prisoner waits for an opportunity ...  ,3,5
"MULDER: Yeah, but you've got prisoners on work detail. Trustees - a man slips away.  ",3,5
MULDER: Why?  ,3,5
MULDER: Reincarnated.  ,3,5
MULDER: Into what form?  ,3,5
MULDER: Any idea how he did it?  ,3,5
"MULDER: Yeah, fine.  ",3,5
MULDER: Okay. I'll be right there.  ,3,5
"MULDER: What's wrong, Scully?  ",3,5
MULDER: I hear you have a list.  ,3,5
MULDER: Guard?  ,3,5
MULDER: How did you come by this list you claim to have?  ,3,5
MULDER: How many names are on the list?  ,3,5
MULDER: So you knew those two guards were gonna be murdered?  ,3,5
MULDER: Who do you think killed them?  ,3,5
"MULDER: You want to make some kind of deal, huh?  ",3,5
MULDER: Why? Are you on the list?  ,3,5
"MULDER: Well, what if they don't give you what you want?  ",3,5
MULDER: You don't have the authority?  ,3,5
MULDER: Yeah.  ,3,5
"MULDER: Listen to this. ""I come in return to the beginning of the end to begin again the journey of souls ... the godhead universal for whom there is no death only life eternal.""  ",3,5
"MULDER: Neech Manley, 1994. This stuff goes on for hundreds of pages. There's references to the Hindu Atman, Prarabdha, the Rosicrucians, Zoroastrianism. The man was obsessed with reincarnation.  ",3,5
MULDER: Unless he knew something we don't.  ,3,5
"MULDER: Every major world religion encompasses the idea of life after death. That means millions, even billions of people believe in some kind of transmigration or rebirth of the soul.  ",3,5
"MULDER: Well, even Christianity teaches about the resurrection and ascendancy of the heavenly body.  ",3,5
MULDER: Is there another competing theory?  ,3,5
"MULDER: That this is a complex scheme, that the headless man planted behind the warden's desk is the work of a conspiracy of inmates.  ",3,5
"MULDER: (he nods) Yeah, but imagine if it were true, Scully. Imagine if you could come back and take out five people who had caused you to suffer. Who would they be?  ",3,5
"MULDER: I remembered your birthday this year, didn't I, Scully? (she smiles) Well, here's somebody we haven't talked to yet. (he pulls a letter from Danielle Manley out of the file) She should know better than anybody else.  ",3,5
MULDER: Mrs. Manley?  ,3,5
MULDER: We're from the FBI. (he flashes his badge) We'd like to ask you a few questions about your husband.  ,3,5
MULDER: Did he ever share his thoughts about dying with you?  ,3,5
"MULDER: You think he's come back, don't you?  ",3,5
"MULDER: She was nervous, or scared.  ",3,5
MULDER: A lot could have happened in her life in those 11 years Neech was in prison. A lot probably did.  ,3,5
"MULDER: I don't know, but I've been thinking a lot about that list, Scully.  ",3,5
MULDER: Who?  ,3,5
MULDER: No one heard anything?  ,3,5
MULDER: Warden?  ,3,5
MULDER: Warden? Why Roque?  ,3,5
"MULDER: Well then, why the other victims?  ",3,5
MULDER: Did Neech have a history with the guards who died?  ,3,5
MULDER: How badly was he beaten?  ,3,5
"MULDER: So there's a pattern here, a logic. All these men had a violent history with Neech. They all caused him to suffer physical pain.  ",3,5
"MULDER: A lockdown may not solve your problem, warden.  ",3,5
"MULDER: If it's a conspiracy among the inmates, but how many inmates could have put that body in your office? How many could have gotten access?  ",3,5
"MULDER: I'm saying that Roque may not be victim number three. Now, I need a name from you. I need the name of Neech's executioner.  ",3,5
MULDER: How many men know it?  ,3,5
"MULDER: Well, his life may be in danger.  ",3,5
"MULDER: Well look at it this way, warden. If I'm right, it'll reduce your list of suspects to four.  ",3,5
MULDER: I'm counting Neech Manley.  ,3,5
MULDER: Mr. Simon? Perry Simon? Couple of days' worth of mail.  ,3,5
MULDER: What is it?  ,3,5
"MULDER: You told me everything but what I need to know. Who else is on that list, John?  ",3,5
"MULDER: How's he doing it, John?  ",3,5
MULDER: And you're just gonna let those men die?  ,3,5
"MULDER: Well, they're going to pin it on somebody! They're gonna pin it on you ...  ",3,5
"MULDER: Put you in solitary, one hour a week outside your cell, no contact with anyone. They say it can break a man.  ",3,5
MULDER: You're afraid of Neech?  ,3,5
MULDER: You saw Neech.  ,3,5
"MULDER: Tell me who else is on the list, John. Who's next?  ",3,5
MULDER: Roque's not on it?  ,3,5
MULDER: And?  ,3,5
MULDER: What kind of connections?  ,3,5
MULDER: Why help Speranza now?  ,3,5
MULDER: You think Speranza's got some sway with Neech?  ,3,5
MULDER: Murdered?  ,3,5
MULDER: This is Agent Mulder. Please open the door.  ,3,5
"MULDER: Mrs. Manley, we're federal agents. Open the door.  ",3,5
MULDER: (knocking again) Danielle?  ,3,5
"MULDER: (knocking again) Mrs. Manley, open the door.  ",3,5
MULDER: (drawing his gun) (to the others) On a count ...  ,3,5
MULDER: Drop your weapon!  ,3,5
"MULDER: Drop your weapon, Danielle. (she does) Let's get a paramedic in here.  ",3,5
MULDER: Forget it.  ,3,5
"MULDER: You know, it just doesn't make sense.  ",3,5
MULDER: Laying it all on Parmelly.  ,3,5
MULDER: It doesn't bother you that he was only on duty for one of the guards' murders or that he wasn't among the three men that knew the name of Neech's executioner?  ,3,5
"MULDER: Well, why would he come to you and try to get you the list?  ",3,5
"MULDER: But Neech hated Roque. If Parmelly was working with Neech, he wouldn't have done that, would he?  ",3,5
MULDER: I just don't see the motives. Do you? I don't think Parmelly killed anybody.  ,3,5
MULDER: Speranza and Neech's wife both said they saw him.  ,3,5
"MULDER: This is my partner, Dana Scully.  ",3,6
MULDER: (picking at the slime with a spoon thingy) This substance --- Did you find it anywhere else in the car? On the carpet or the upholstery? (spoons it into a vial)  ,3,6
MULDER: So it was only on the victims body?  ,3,6
MULDER: No. Not yet. (walks away)  ,3,6
MULDER: A couple of months ago a case came across my desk from the Mississippi office. Four women from Aberdeen had disappeared in less than a month.  ,3,6
"MULDER: Only one of the victims was found, but her body was too decomposed to perform a viable autopsy.  ",3,6
MULDER: I know. Thats why I want you to find out what this is while youre at the coroners office. (hands her the vial)  ,3,6
"MULDER: Im going to try to find out if Lauren MacKelvey was a Lonely Heart. Each of the Aberdeen victims had answered personal ads in the local papers. If this is the same killer, hes just getting started.  ",3,6
MULDER: I thought you said you never met the man Lauren was with last night.  ,3,6
MULDER: They met through an online service?  ,3,6
MULDER: Right. Do you remember what room Lauren was in when she met him?  ,3,6
"MULDER: ""Too Shy?""  ",3,6
MULDER: She read you his letters? Do you think that she kept any hard copies of them?  ,3,6
MULDER: Yes. Can I use your phone?  ,3,6
"MULDER: (on phone) Listen, Scully. Our killer may have moved out of the personal columns and onto the internet. Im gonna send out a localized online warning.  ",3,6
MULDER: (on phone) Because he opened the account with one of the Aberdeen victims credit cards. I just called the online service.  ,3,6
MULDER: (on phone) Did you find anything in the autopsy?  ,3,6
MULDER and SCULLY looking at nasty remains of the body.)  ,3,6
MULDER: (referring to the vial of slime) What did this turn out to be?  ,3,6
MULDER: Its similar to stomach acid?  ,3,6
MULDER: So youre saying that this did that?  ,3,6
"MULDER: (pointing at the remains in the drawer) Whats in here, Scully? Theoretically it should contain the same cellular components as her various tissuesskin, muscle, blood   ",3,6
MULDER: In the results of your chemical analysis did you find anything missing?  ,3,6
MULDER: Yeah.  ,3,6
MULDER: Fatty tissue. That could explain the weight discrepancy.  ,3,6
MULDER: The ME recorded Laurens weight at 122 but her drivers license had her at 165.  ,3,6
"MULDER: No, actually Laurens roommate said she was quite nervous about meeting this guy because she put on some weight recently.  ",3,6
MULDER: I dont know.  ,3,6
MULDER: (arriving on the scene) What happened?  ,3,6
MULDER: Were dealing with a serial murderer whos using an online service to attract his victims  all single women looking for Mr. Right.  ,3,6
"MULDER: No, it doesnt. Something must have gone wrong last night. He was forced to improvise.  ",3,6
MULDER: Not necessarily. (pulls out papers) These are letters he e-mailed to Lauren MacKalvey. They contain lines from a handful 16th century Italian poems.  ,3,6
MULDER: You wont find any of these in Bartletts.  ,3,6
"MULDER: Look at this. Guinezelles ""Lavitanova,"" Casteonas ""Il Courtagiano,"" and others I wont even try to pronounce. These are from obscure texts from privately owned libraries that only lend to academic affiliates.  ",3,6
"MULDER: Or a graduate student, a visiting Fellow, maybe a translator. What we need is to compile a list of everybody in Cleveland who has these credentials. Can you do that?  ",3,6
"MULDER: It looks like she took her pound of flesh, huh?  ",3,6
MULDER: Did you find anything?  ,3,6
MULDER: That skin you found under the prostitutes fingernails -- I had the crime lab check the DNA results against the known offenders database.  ,3,6
"MULDER: No, but they did find something else. Check the next page where Ive circled. (puts his hand on her back leading her to a more private part of the busy room)  ",3,6
"MULDER: (leaning close to her) Okay, its not yet the finely detailed insanity that youve come to expect from me. Its just a theory, but what if hes not doing this out of a psychotic impulse but rather out of physical hunger? Maybe he needs to replenish this chemical deficiency in order to survive  ",3,6
MULDER: I dont know how else to explain MacKalveys missing adipose. And I bet if you checked the Aberdeen victims youd find exactly the same thing. This killer secretes a digestive substance which renders the victims fat  ,3,6
"MULDER: There are examples of this in nature, arent there?  ",3,6
"MULDER: Okay, but if Im right, were not just looking for a serial murderer. Were looking for some kind of genetically different human being  a creature who may be responsible for who knows how many missing person cases throughout the United States.  ",3,6
MULDER comes over to SCULLY.)  ,3,6
MULDER: Scully. I wouldnt have made a good Amway salesman. I knocked on more doors.  ,3,6
MULDER: (on phone) Hes a police detective . His names Cross.. Thats right. He would have been by sometime this afternoon.  ,3,6
MULDER: We just got a 911 reporting a possible homicide from a young girl at one of the addresses on Crosss list.  ,3,6
MULDER: What about Cross?  ,3,6
"MULDER: Composite artist came up with this sketch from a neighbors description. His name is Virgil Incanto. At least thats what it says on his rental agreement. Theres no record that the guy even exists  no DMV, no birth certificate, no Social Security, not even a bank account.  ",3,6
"MULDER: Hes a translator of Italian literature. Freelance, but his publisher pays him in cashiers checks  ",3,6
"MULDER: Hes not going to New York, Scully. Not now. Hes smarter than that. He knows how to survive, you know?  ",3,6
"MULDER: He made contact with each one of his victims, right? (goes to computer)  ",3,6
"MULDER: That means theyre all in here somewhere. Each one of them. Past, present and future.  ",3,6
MULDER: Any chance of resurrecting them?  ,3,6
MULDER: We dont have much time.  ,3,6
MULDER: That may not be necessary.  ,3,6
MULDER: That was Lauren MacKalveys online name. These are all his victims. A regular grocery list.  ,3,6
"MULDER: (on phone) Okay, thanks. (hangs up) That was Cleveland TV. Theyve already reported three of the women on the list as missing.  ",3,6
MULDER: We better go check on them anyway.  ,3,6
MULDER: (showing badge) Were with the FBI. Were looking for Ellen Kaminsky.  ,3,6
MULDER: Get back in.  ,3,6
MULDER: Ellen?  ,3,6
MULDER: Freeze! Federal Agent! Now put your hands up and step out where I can see you.  ,3,6
MULDER: Jennifer Flackett. Kathy Miller. Hillary Turk. 47 women reported missing in five states. At least give their families some peace of mind and tell us how many are on that list because of you.  ,3,6
"MULDER: (disgusted) Come on, Scully. (to guard) Open the door.  ",3,6
MULDER: You mean they don't believe you.  ,3,7
MULDER: You said on the report that at the time of the accident you believed there was somebody else in the room.  ,3,7
MULDER: But this person saved your life. Is that right?  ,3,7
MULDER: You have any idea who it is?  ,3,7
MULDER: A GI?  ,3,7
MULDER: He speaks to you.  ,3,7
"MULDER: Asked by whom, Captain?  ",3,7
"MULDER: What, we didn't sign in at the front desk?  ",3,7
MULDER: General.  ,3,7
MULDER: I guess this isn't a good time to thank you for seeing us.  ,3,7
"MULDER: Well, according to him, he was prevented from doing so by some kind of phantom soldier.  ",3,7
"MULDER: Before throwing himself into a wood chipper on the hospital grounds. Now, unless that's procedure and protocol, I'd say that the incidents and details have been strangely overlooked, Sir.  ",3,7
MULDER: You really think the General's got something to hide?  ,3,7
MULDER: You don't think he's just closing ranks to protect his men?  ,3,7
MULDER: What's that?  ,3,7
MULDER: Why would he do that?  ,3,7
MULDER: Because they were his soldiers and he feels somewhat responsible for the tragedies that have played out?  ,3,7
"MULDER: Maybe he knows the deeper secrets to their madness, the biological weapons they were exposed to during the war. The cause of the effect.  ",3,7
"MULDER: You know, what I can't figure out is why a man who so deliberately and methodically set out to commit suicide would leave the one entrance to the room unsecured. But then again, I obviously have a feeble grasp of Army protocol and procedure.  ",3,7
"MULDER: I talked with security personnel. Other than Captain Draper, they saw no one enter the pool last night and no one leave.  ",3,7
"MULDER: General, do you have a family of your own?  ",3,7
"MULDER: If the pattern we've seen is at all consistent, you and your family may be in danger.  ",3,7
MULDER: Keep an eye out. Watch for anything out of the ordinary.  ,3,7
"MULDER: This is a military base, Scully. There's security everywhere yet nobody saw or heard a thing.  ",3,7
MULDER: It also fits the MO of Lt. Col. Stans' phantom killer.  ,3,7
"MULDER: Well, just a word to the wise, Sir.  ",3,7
MULDER: Any unusual or unexplained phenomena.  ,3,7
MULDER: Again? This happen before?  ,3,7
MULDER: Did you save the other ones?  ,3,7
MULDER: Have you noticed any other kind of electrical interference? The radio or the television?  ,3,7
"MULDER: You'd better call the police, General.  ",3,7
MULDER: No. But I'm really beginning to like the tune.  ,3,7
MULDER: Really? Where?  ,3,7
MULDER: Want me to go run 'em?  ,3,7
MULDER: Hands up. Hands up. Put your hands over your head.  ,3,7
MULDER: Put your hands down behind your back. (To an FBI) Cuff him.  ,3,7
MULDER: General and Mrs. Thomas Callahan...  ,3,7
MULDER: No!  ,3,7
"MULDER: How did he do it, Quinton?  ",3,7
MULDER: How did he get past the guards? How did he kill him? Trevor was only 8 years old.  ,3,7
"MULDER: What does that mean, you're just the mailman?  ",3,7
MULDER: He said he was the mailman. What did he mean by that?  ,3,7
MULDER: I'll catch up with you later.  ,3,7
MULDER: How did it happen?  ,3,7
MULDER: Had anybody been in the cell with him?  ,3,7
MULDER: Not likely.  ,3,7
"MULDER: Yeah. He had help. Scully, and he wasn't lying because I think the man who killed him was Leonard Trimble.  ",3,7
MULDER: Yeah.  ,3,7
MULDER: You see this?  ,3,7
MULDER: This is an X-ray dental plate.  ,3,7
"MULDER: No, actually, the ones I've been walking around with I had developed at the hospital.  ",3,7
"MULDER: See, this is the one I was carrying when we first met Stans... this one in the rehab room, in the pool, in the General's office, and this one in the General's house. All of them exposed to some kind of radiation.  ",3,7
"MULDER: From Stans' phantom soldier. I came down here wondering if it could be true, what Lt. Col. Stans was describing was a case of astral-projection.  ",3,7
"MULDER: Practitioners claim that during a self hypnotic trance, the astro body can actually detaches itself and can float virtually anywhere, sometimes invisible, but sometimes appearing as a apparition. They even claim that the astro-body has psychokinetic capabilities that is far greater than the corporeal body.  ",3,7
"MULDER: Well, maybe he needs a psychic connection to a place. A thing or an object ... a letter! That's why Quinton called himself the mailman.  ",3,7
MULDER: Sometimes the only sane response to an insane world is insanity.  ,3,7
MULDER: Do you know anything about backwards masking?  ,3,7
"MULDER: Yeah, or on the General's answering machine. Check this out.  ",3,7
MULDER: Leonard Trimble?  ,3,7
MULDER: He's dead.  ,3,7
MULDER: Why did you kill him?  ,3,7
"MULDER: I read your medical record, Leonard. We know that you refused all efforts at rehabilitation. You've even refused to be fitted with prosthetic limbs.  ",3,7
MULDER: Maybe because you don't need it. Because you can leave your body anytime you want. Kill anybody you want to kill.  ,3,7
MULDER: Like kill General Callahan's boy? Lt. Col. Stans' family? Sergeant Aiklen?  ,3,7
"MULDER: Oh, I'm a trip, because I figured you out? You're a soldier. You knew what you were getting into when you enlisted. Now you want to blame everybody else. Why do you want to blame your COs?  ",3,7
MULDER: So you took theirs.  ,3,7
MULDER: No sleepwalking.  ,3,7
MULDER: Call General Callahan... tell him to stay out of his house.  ,3,7
MULDER: (from Rappo's room off screen) Scully?  ,3,7
"MULDER: No, I don't think so.  ",3,7
MULDER: General Callahan!  ,3,7
MULDER: General Callahan?!  ,3,7
MULDER: General Callahan... are you hurt?  ,3,7
"MULDER: No evidence was found linking Leonard Trimble to the deaths of General Callahan's wife and son. Officially, the case remains open. The murders unsolved.  ",3,7
"MULDER: Leonard Trimble's family requested his burial at Arlington National Cemetery. The Army denied this request. Trimble was cremated, his ashes interred at a civilian cemetery in Tannersville, PA. Leonard Trimble's mission was not to kill his enemies... but to shatter their lives... to keep them alive. To suffer the pain that he felt. To see the view from his wheel chair. (NOTE: Closed captioning during this voice over : The Army Board of Inquiry declined to press charges against Lt. Col. Victor Stans after a lengthy investigation. Stans was released from the hospital and posted under medical supervision at Ft. Evanston.)  ",3,7
"MULDER: Amputees sometimes feel the pain of phantom limbs... ghosts of hands still clenching... legs, still aching.  ",3,7
MULDER: Is it not possible that Trimble developed a phantom soul? A malevolent psyche that took its revenge on those he held accountable?  ,3,7
"MULDER: (CLOSED CAPTIONING: Leonard Trimble was a casualty of the Gulf War. A victim of friendly fire. The wounds of war, however, can go beyond the physical and mental injuries of battle. There was a spiritual toll on the combatants, the attack against the psyche that leaves in its wake only bitterness and anger. It was war that destroyed Leonard Trimble's body and released his phantom soul. And it was war that destroyed those parts of himself that make us civilized human beings... those better angels of our nature.)  ",3,7
MULDER: Im looking for the agent in charge.  ,3,8
MULDER: (showing badge) Special Agent Mulder.  ,3,8
MULDER: Mrs. Jacobs? Im Fox Mulder. Im with the FBI. Im sorry about your daughter.  ,3,8
MULDER: Were going to do everything we can to find her.  ,3,8
MULDER: I know you must be feeling   ,3,8
MULDER: Fox Mulder. Any leads on a suspect?  ,3,8
MULDER: The neighbors?  ,3,8
"MULDER: No, I bet that he didnt know her so well or else he wouldnt have been so bold.  ",3,8
MULDER: What about this woman at the restaurant?  ,3,8
"MULDER: Yeah, thats why I came down here.  ",3,8
MULDER: Mind if I talk to her?  ,3,8
MULDER: Great. Thanks.  ,3,8
MULDER: (surprised to see her) I thought you missed your flight.  ,3,8
MULDER: I forgot it. I left in kind of a hurry.  ,3,8
"MULDER: Yeah, 15 year old girl, Amy Jacobs was taken from her bedroom last night, 10:00.  ",3,8
MULDER: No. They havent found her.  ,3,8
MULDER: A 30-year-old woman named Lucy Householder was admitted here shortly after 10:00. She collapsed at work suffering from some kind of seizure and what her doctors are calling glossolalia.  ,3,8
"MULDER: (hitting elevator button) Technically, but whether she knew it or not, she was repeating the exact words spoken by Amys abductor the exact same time 20 miles across town.  ",3,8
"MULDER: Thats my name, isnt it? Turns out, Lucy Householder knows a little something about kidnapping herself. When she was eight years old she was taken from her bedroom while her parents were asleep. She was missing for five years until she escaped and someone found her by the side of the road. Apparently, her abductor had kept her locked in a basement the entire time. They never caught him.  ",3,8
MULDER: Lucy? Im Fox Mulder. This is Dana Scully. Were with the FBI. Wed like to ask you a few questions.  ,3,8
MULDER: A young girl was kidnapped last night. Have you heard anything about that?  ,3,8
MULDER: Do you remember what you were saying last night when you collapsed at work?  ,3,8
"MULDER: You were saying ""Nobodys going to spoil us.""  ",3,8
"MULDER: Those were the exact words spoken by the kidnapper to the little girl when he took her last night. So you can see, that under the circumstances, it might seem strange that you   ",3,8
"MULDER: No. We just want to find the little girl any way we can, and if you know anything   ",3,8
"MULDER: All right, well thanks for talking to us, Lucy.  ",3,8
"MULDER: No, we cant hold you here. Youre free to go.  ",3,8
MULDER: Yeah.  ,3,8
MULDER: Im working on it.  ,3,8
MULDER: It doesnt surprise me given her history.  ,3,8
MULDER: I dont think shes involved.  ,3,8
"MULDER: (walking away) No. Let me follow up on that, okay? Thanks.  ",3,8
MULDER: What?  ,3,8
MULDER: Yeah?  ,3,8
MULDER: How could it be Amy Jacobs blood? Lucy was all the way across town.  ,3,8
"MULDER: Why? Because it matches the victims blood type? How many people have B -positive blood, Scully? One in five? Thats got to be hundreds of thousands of people in the local population alone.  ",3,8
"MULDER: (leans down close to SCULLY) Lucy is a victim, Scully, just like Amy Jacobs. If shes got any connection to this case thats the extent of it.  ",3,8
MULDER: What are you talking about?  ,3,8
MULDER: (looks to see if anyone overheard) Will you do me a favor? Will you keep that under your hat?  ,3,8
"MULDER: Cause I dont want Lucy Householder treated like a suspect in this case until its absolutely certain she is one, okay?  ",3,8
MULDER: Hows she doing?  ,3,8
MULDER: Thanks.  ,3,8
"MULDER: What do you say, Lucy? Can I take you to dinner?  ",3,8
MULDER: You feeling better?  ,3,8
MULDER: Better than Amy Jacobs?  ,3,8
"MULDER: If anybody knows, Id say you do.  ",3,8
MULDER: Howd you scratch your face?  ,3,8
"MULDER: (quietly) Are you using again, Lucy?  ",3,8
MULDER: Have you ever experienced temporary blindness before?  ,3,8
"MULDER: That girls in trouble, Lucy.  ",3,8
"MULDER: I think you can, Lucy.  ",3,8
"MULDER: Well, thats something you have to tell me.  ",3,8
MULDER: Lead us to her.  ,3,8
"MULDER: Well, thats too bad, Lucy, because right now I think youre her best hope.  ",3,8
"MULDER: Scully, take a look at this.  ",3,8
"MULDER: Yeah. Taken in 1978, the week she was found. Shed been held in the dark so long her eyes were hypersensitive to the light. Whoever held her captive wasnt very big on conversation, either. Shes 13 years old and can barely string two words together. Its amazing shes gotten anywhere in life.  ",3,8
MULDER: What is it?  ,3,8
MULDER: Whos the photographer?  ,3,8
MULDER: What have you got on him?  ,3,8
MULDER: Have you shown this picture to Amys little sister?  ,3,8
MULDER: Im going to take it and show it to Lucy.  ,3,8
MULDER: Lucy?  ,3,8
"MULDER: Lucy, wait.  ",3,8
"MULDER: I just want to ask you a question. Lucy, wait a second. (reaches for her)  ",3,8
MULDER: Im sorry.  ,3,8
"MULDER: I just want to show you a photograph, okay?  ",3,8
MULDER: You recognize him dont you?  ,3,8
MULDER: Lucy.  ,3,8
MULDER: Lucy?  ,3,8
MULDER: Hes probably changed a lot over the last 17 years. Did you even know his name? Carl Wade. He worked as a photographers assistant. School pictures mostly. Thats where he saw Amy Jacobs.  ,3,8
MULDER: I want you to tell me what youre going through. It might feel good to tell somebody.  ,3,8
"MULDER: You can actually feel what shes going through, cant you?  ",3,8
"MULDER: Lucy, she needs your help.  ",3,8
MULDER: Lucy .  ,3,8
"MULDER: (to LUCY) Wait here a second, okay?  ",3,8
MULDER: Whats going on?  ,3,8
MULDER: Why?  ,3,8
MULDER: What the hell is happening?  ,3,8
"MULDER: She didnt do it, Scully.  ",3,8
MULDER: She was just here.  ,3,8
MULDER: Youre going to drive her away with this.  ,3,8
MULDER: A half a dozen witnesses placed her across town at the time of the kidnapping.  ,3,8
"MULDER: Well, then trust me on this. Shes not working with Wade.  ",3,8
MULDER: She may have bled it.  ,3,8
MULDER: Yes. It may explain why there was so little of it on the carpet in Amys bedroom.  ,3,8
"MULDER: (crumpling the poster and walking away) Hes wrong, Scully.  ",3,8
"MULDER: Im protecting her because I think shes connected to Amy Jacobs, just not the way everybody else thinks she is.  ",3,8
MULDER: (stops and faces her) Carl Wade? Why would she be connected with Carl Wade?  ,3,8
"MULDER: After five years in a dark pit, Im sure she developed some kind of connection with Wade, just not the kind that youre suggesting.  ",3,8
"MULDER: I dont know how to explain it, but I think that Wades abduction of Amy triggered some kind of physical response in Lucy  some kind of empathic transference.  ",3,8
"MULDER: Thats how I account for what Lucys going through. Thats how I account for the identical words that corresponded to Amy, and the spontaneous wounds and blood, as well.  ",3,8
MULDER: Because shes afraid. (steps away from her and leans against a file cabinet.)  ,3,8
MULDER: (getting irritated) What dont I see?  ,3,8
"MULDER: (hurt and angry) You dont think Ive thought of that? I have. And not everything I do, say, think, and feel goes back to my sister. You, of all people should realize that sometimes motivations for behavior can be more complex and mysterious than tracing them back to one single childhood experience.  ",3,8
MULDER: What about the girl? Was she with him?  ,3,8
MULDER: Which way was the car headed?  ,3,8
"MULDER: (looking at map) Okay, Interstate 12 county 15 north  903. look at this. Right off the 903.  ",3,8
MULDER: Thats where Lucy was found 17 years ago.  ,3,8
"MULDER: Its a small town, Scully. Somebodys bound to know Wades face. Know where he lives.  ",3,8
"MULDER: (pointing to photography store) But hes a photographer, right?  ",3,8
MULDER: He should have an account here.  ,3,8
MULDER: Amy? (he goes out of sight)  ,3,8
MULDER: Yeah.  ,3,8
"MULDER: No. Ill take her. Come on, Lucy.  ",3,8
"MULDER: What else, Lucy? Tell me what else?  ",3,8
"MULDER: Lucy, you came here to help her.  ",3,8
MULDER: Why else would you come back here if not for Amy? Youre sharing her pain.  ,3,8
MULDER: Youre the survivor. Youre the strong one. Now Amy needs some of your strength.  ,3,8
MULDER: She has to make it and you have to help her.  ,3,8
"MULDER: Lucy, Lucy, sit down. Sit down. (puts her in backseat of car)  ",3,8
MULDER: Theyre in the water.  ,3,8
MULDER: Theres a river near here. I think thats where they are.  ,3,8
MULDER: Wade lives here. He knows these woods. He could be doubling back.  ,3,8
"MULDER: No, but I think thats what shes trying to do. (begins running)  ",3,8
MULDER: Wade! Federal Officer! Hold it right there!  ,3,8
MULDER: Shes not breathing. No pulse either.  ,3,8
"MULDER: Come on, Amy, breathe. (breathes again)  ",3,8
"MULDER: Damn it, Amy, come on!  ",3,8
MULDER: Hows Amy?  ,3,8
MULDER: How serious were her injuries?  ,3,8
MULDER: He must have dragged her through the woods for at least a mile.  ,3,8
MULDER: Did they finish up on Lucy?  ,3,8
"MULDER: She drowned, didnt she?  ",3,8
MULDER: She saved Amys life.  ,3,8
MULDER: I think she died for more than Amy. (rises and crosses to window)  ,3,8
"MULDER: I think finally, it was  the only way she could escape. The only way she could forget what happened 17 years ago. Finally, the only way she could outrun Carl Wade.  ",3,8
MULDER: Come on in.  ,3,9
MULDER: Something that just came in the mail.  ,3,9
"MULDER: According to the magazine ad I answered, it's an alien autopsy. Guaranteed authentic.  ",3,9
"MULDER: Twenty-nine ninety-five, plus shipping.  ",3,9
"MULDER: But it, it does look authentic.  ",3,9
"MULDER: Well, maybe it's this green substance they seem to be extracting from the subject.  ",3,9
"MULDER: It's widely held that aliens don't have blood, Scully.  ",3,9
MULDER: Where's the alien.  ,3,9
"MULDER: No, that, that autopsy you saw on TV was so fake precisely because it tried to show too much.  ",3,9
"MULDER: Yes, and because, uh...  ",3,9
"MULDER: Some guy in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Claims he pulled it off the satellite dish at two in the morning.  ",3,9
MULDER: Back door's been busted open.  ,3,9
MULDER: Federal agent!  ,3,9
MULDER: Did you try the F.B.I. field office?  ,3,9
"MULDER: Well, look at this... a beacon in the night.  ",3,9
"MULDER: You don't, uh, speak Japanese by any chance, do you?  ",3,9
"MULDER: A murder suspect, yeah.  ",3,9
MULDER: What are you talking about?  ,3,9
"MULDER: This man, sitting in here?  ",3,9
"MULDER: Oh, I didn't get his name. I was too busy getting my ass kicked.  ",3,9
MULDER: Tracking down a video piracy thing.  ,3,9
MULDER: Obviously not strengthening the international relations.  ,3,9
"MULDER: No, I paid my twenty-nine ninety-five, Scully. I think I'm entitled to a few more answers, don't you think?  ",3,9
MULDER: I just remembered a piece of evidence from the crime scene that I forgot to turn in.  ,3,9
MULDER: They look like satellite photos.  ,3,9
"MULDER: Maybe he was going to fit her for a pillowcase too. Why don't you stick around, get a motel room and check it out in the morning?  ",3,9
"MULDER: I'm going to go back to D.C. like a good boy, like Skinner told me to do, and show these to a few friends of ours.)  ",3,9
MULDER: So you're saying that's from a German satellite?  ,3,9
"MULDER: Got to love that global economy, huh?  ",3,9
MULDER: Japanese diplomat.  ,3,9
MULDER: What exactly are they spying on there?  ,3,9
MULDER: Did they find it?  ,3,9
MULDER: Why do you say that?  ,3,9
MULDER: The naval shipyard.  ,3,9
"MULDER: Well, maybe what they found wasn't a Japanese sub.  ",3,9
"MULDER: It's a salvage ship registered in San Diego. According to the harbor master, you went out to meet the boat when customs wouldn't allow it into port.  ",3,9
"MULDER: The D.E.A.? Why, what was the problem?  ",3,9
MULDER: Did they find anything?  ,3,9
MULDER: Were they?  ,3,9
"MULDER: Well, that doesn't make any sense.  ",3,9
"MULDER: The Talapus came nonstop from Panama. She would have had to stop to refuel, wouldn't she?  ",3,9
MULDER: Would you do me a favor? Would you see if there's any paperwork on this? See if there's a heading or a destination for the Talapus.  ,3,9
MULDER: That's all right. I'm happy to wait.  ,3,9
MULDER: I don't remember giving you a key.  ,3,9
"MULDER: Yeah, I guess I should really fire my maid, shouldn't I?  ",3,9
MULDER: What are you talking about?  ,3,9
MULDER: Our murder suspect.  ,3,9
MULDER: What do they think was in it?  ,3,9
MULDER: Am I being accused of murder?  ,3,9
MULDER: Agent Scully has it.  ,3,9
"MULDER: I don't know, I haven't spoken to her since I left her in Allentown.  ",3,9
MULDER: Mind if I tidy up a bit in here first?  ,3,9
MULDER: Thank you for seeing me on such short notice.  ,3,9
MULDER: Then you already know what I'm up against.  ,3,9
MULDER: I need your advice on how to proceed.  ,3,9
MULDER: I'd be implicating myself.  ,3,9
MULDER: But I can't afford to become entangled in a murder investigation. Not now.  ,3,9
MULDER: Because of what I've seen. Because it would give them time to bury it all where I might not find it again.  ,3,9
MULDER: I'm listening.  ,3,9
MULDER: What kind of project?  ,3,9
MULDER: What am I onto here?  ,3,9
MULDER: Scully.  ,3,9
MULDER: I got something to show you.  ,3,9
MULDER: Allentown?  ,3,9
"MULDER: Oh, what'd you find?  ",3,9
"MULDER: But you're fine, aren't you, Scully?  ",3,9
MULDER: That is disturbing. But I don't think you should freak out until we find out what this thing is.  ,3,9
MULDER: That's a group of Japanese medical officers taken during World War II.  ,3,9
"MULDER: No, I don't think so. Not unless you were in Japan in the last fifty years.  ",3,9
"MULDER: His name is Doctor Takeo Ishimaru, he's been dead since 1965. He was the commander of an elite section of the Japanese medical corps known as ""seven thirty-one,"" a unit now known to have experimented on human subjects. They performed vivisections without anesthesia...  ",3,9
"MULDER: Four of the doctors you see in this photo were on that videotape I showed you, performing that autopsy.  ",3,9
"MULDER: Somebody could, because those same four men were murdered yesterday, found here right on U.S. soil.  ",3,9
MULDER: That's what I'd like to know.  ,3,9
MULDER: Possibly our government.  ,3,9
"MULDER: For continuing their work. The work the Nazis were doing, trying to create an alien-human hybrid.  ",3,9
"MULDER: Scully, after all you've seen... after all you've told me you've seen. The tunnel with medical files, the, the beings moving past you, the... the implant in your neck, why do you refuse to believe?  ",3,9
MULDER: You think that believing is easy?  ,3,9
MULDER: Part of our government's secret railroad. Train cars used to carry test subjects.  ,3,9
MULDER: From someone like you who wants proof...  ,3,9
"MULDER: Hey, Scully, it's me.  ",3,9
"MULDER: A trainyard in Quinnimont, West Virginia. A group of Japanese men just put someone in one of those boxcars we saw in the satellite photos.  ",3,9
"MULDER: Something serious is going down here, Scully.  ",3,9
MULDER: The thing they put in the train? It was alive.  ,3,9
MULDER: I got to get on that train. It's hooking up with a Canadian passenger train outside Cincinnati.  ,3,9
"MULDER: Well, that's where you know him from, then.  ",3,9
"MULDER: Express train to Vancouver, what track is it on?  ",3,9
"MULDER: When, when did it leave?  ",3,9
MULDER: Thanks.  ,3,9
MULDER: Mulder.  ,3,9
MULDER: Why not?  ,3,9
MULDER: Who told you that?  ,3,9
"MULDER: Who told you, Scully?  ",3,9
MULDER: I can't.  ,3,9
"MULDER: Aw, damn it.  ",3,10
"MULDER: Excuse me. I need your assistance. I'm a federal agent, my name is Mulder.  ",3,10
MULDER: I need access to that quarantine car you picked up in West Virginia.  ,3,10
"MULDER: I'm a federal agent, sir. I need you to open that car.  ",3,10
"MULDER: Well, somebody's got to be able to get in that car.  ",3,10
MULDER: What's his name?  ,3,10
MULDER: Can you take me to his compartment?  ,3,10
MULDER: Stay here. Knock on the door but stay away from it.  ,3,10
MULDER: Knock again.  ,3,10
MULDER: Open it. Just unlock it and step away.  ,3,10
MULDER: If he finds you before I find him...  ,3,10
MULDER: I just want you to point it at him.  ,3,10
MULDER: Just make sure he runs my way.  ,3,10
MULDER: Excuse me?  ,3,10
"MULDER: No, no, shh shh shh, he's just got a little motion sickness.  ",3,10
"MULDER: I found Zama four cars up, strangled in the bathroom.  ",3,10
"MULDER: Now, I want you to get up there and seal off that bathroom. I want you to get word to the engineer not to stop this train until I tell him, okay? Until I find the killer.  ",3,10
MULDER: Put your hands in the air and turn around!  ,3,10
"MULDER: Well, maybe you should've filled me in before you tried to kill me. Now, who are you?  ",3,10
MULDER: Answer me!  ,3,10
MULDER: The N.S.A.? Since when did they start issuing you guys piano wire instead of guns?  ,3,10
"MULDER: There's something on this train, but it's not a bomb. Throw that here.  ",3,10
MULDER: Why?  ,3,10
MULDER: So you killed him.  ,3,10
MULDER: Put your hands in the air.  ,3,10
MULDER: I'll take my chances.  ,3,10
MULDER: No.  ,3,10
MULDER: Take it out. Slowly.  ,3,10
MULDER: No? How did you get in here?  ,3,10
MULDER: One-one-one-one-four-seven-one.  ,3,10
MULDER: What?  ,3,10
"MULDER: There's a bomb on this train, where is it?  ",3,10
"MULDER: No, it couldn't be anywhere. If you activated it coming in here, it's got to be on this car.  ",3,10
MULDER: Where do you think it is?  ,3,10
MULDER: You know what I think? I think you're a liar. I don't think you work for the N.S.A. and I don't think there's a bomb on this train.  ,3,10
MULDER: Shut up!  ,3,10
MULDER: Put it down.  ,3,10
"MULDER: Scully, where are you?  ",3,10
MULDER: Who dialed this number?  ,3,10
MULDER: What are you talking about?  ,3,10
"MULDER: You're wrong, Scully.  ",3,10
"MULDER: Well, whatever his name was, Scully, he's dead. I don't think this has anything to do with lepers.  ",3,10
MULDER: Who told you this?  ,3,10
"MULDER: Well, why do you believe him?  ",3,10
MULDER: What? What's he shown you?  ,3,10
"MULDER: What are you talking about, Scully?  ",3,10
MULDER: Scully...  ,3,10
MULDER: Scully? Scully?  ,3,10
"MULDER: Yeah. So what are you saying, that Zama is the one who abducted these women?  ",3,10
MULDER: What about the UFO I saw them working on?  ,3,10
MULDER: How can you be so sure?  ,3,10
MULDER: Those tests never ended.  ,3,10
MULDER: Why?  ,3,10
"MULDER: Well, Scully, you're a little late. I'm locked inside that train car.  ",3,10
MULDER: Where is it?  ,3,10
MULDER: Step back.  ,3,10
MULDER: Hold on.  ,3,10
MULDER: Little over an hour and a half.  ,3,10
MULDER: Why?  ,3,10
"MULDER: Uh, Scully, you're breaking up. I can't hear you.  ",3,10
MULDER: Scully?  ,3,10
MULDER: Scully?  ,3,10
MULDER: Step aside.  ,3,10
"MULDER: All right, listen to me. I want you to get word to the engineer that there's a bomb on this car.  ",3,10
"MULDER: That's right. I want you to tell him not to make his next scheduled stop and to reroute, you understand?  ",3,10
MULDER: I want you to tell him to choose a place as far away from a populated area as possible and unhook this car.  ,3,10
"MULDER: Let's move into the corner over there, now.  ",3,10
MULDER: I want you to kneel down and put your hands behind you back.  ,3,10
"MULDER: If what's on this train is important as I think it is, they will.  ",3,10
MULDER: What do you care? You were trying to kill me anyway.  ,3,10
"MULDER: Scully, let me tell you, you haven't seen America till you've seen it from a train.  ",3,10
"MULDER: We're not going to make that station, Scully.  ",3,10
"MULDER: No, but I'm sure they'll find us. We probably lit up every spy satellite in this hemisphere. It was the only thing to do, Scully. If you're right about what's on this car, an explosion outside a populated area...  ",3,10
MULDER: We'll have to wait and see.  ,3,10
MULDER: I'm fielding all offers and suggestions.  ,3,10
"MULDER: Tell me something. You got on this train to kill Doctor Zama, then what? What were your orders then?  ",3,10
"MULDER: Well, what about that thing locked back there? What provisions were made for saving its life?  ",3,10
"MULDER: You know what it is, don't you? You're going to die for that thing. Is it important enough to die for? What is it, a plague carrier? A leper?  ",3,10
MULDER: A weapon?  ,3,10
"MULDER: A standing army immune to the effects of those weapons. That's what Doctor Zama did, didn't he? He came up with an immunity to those weapons... and he was trying to smuggle that thing back to his own country to share the science, only our government isn't in the mood to share, right? They've been doing experiments since World War II, tests on innocent civilians... but Zama succeeded where the others had failed. And that thing in there...  ",3,10
MULDER: Yeah.  ,3,10
MULDER: What is it?  ,3,10
MULDER: What are you watching?  ,3,10
MULDER: You mean I might get my twenty-nine ninety-five's worth after all?  ,3,10
MULDER: Let's hope not. What's the code?  ,3,10
"MULDER: Wait, are you there?  ",3,10
"MULDER: One, zero, one.  ",3,10
"MULDER: Three, three.  ",3,10
"MULDER: Tick-tick, Scully.  ",3,10
MULDER: You think it's a one? Are you sure?  ,3,10
MULDER: One.  ,3,10
"MULDER: No. Okay, call me if you learn anything.  ",3,10
"MULDER: Senator Matheson hasn't returned my phone calls. His, uh... his aides say he's out of the country.  ",3,10
MULDER: Did you locate the briefcase that Zama left on the train.  ,3,10
MULDER: This doesn't look like the same briefcase.  ,3,10
MULDER: These aren't the same journals. They've all been rewritten.  ,3,10
"MULDER: They're getting away with it, Scully.  ",3,10
MULDER: I know what I saw on that train car. It wasn't a leper and it wasn't human.  ,3,10
"MULDER: I, I don't need an apology for the lies. I, I don't care about the fictions they create to cover their crimes. I want them accountable for what did happen. I want an apology for the truth.  ",3,10
MULDER: His parishioners said the Reverend Finley was bleeding from his hands like the wounds of the crucifixion.  ,3,11
MULDER: The sign bestowed by God upon the righteous.  ,3,11
"MULDER: No, I think this is a case of too much faith. (He dabs his finger into some ""blood"" next to the body and tastes it) And too much sugar.  ",3,11
MULDER: It's fake. Just like the others.  ,3,11
"MULDER: I've been tracking a series of international religiously motivated murders. All of the victims have been so-called stigmatics and all of them have been frauds, like the Reverend here.  ",3,11
"MULDER: It's a claim that's wholly unsubstantiated, though there have been many pretenders, eleven of whom have been murdered in the past three years.  ",3,11
"MULDER: Either we're dealing with a psychotic religious fanatic who's hell-bent on exposing these kind of frauds, or a less programmatic psycho who harbors a murderous resentment towards the church, or maybe it's just a very disgruntled altar boy.  ",3,11
"MULDER: Anyway, it's safe to say this guy carries a grudge, and if I'm right about one thing, the killer is here and he's looking for victim number twelve.  ",3,11
MULDER: Thank you for contacting us so quickly.  ,3,11
MULDER: Institutionalized for what?  ,3,11
MULDER: Let me talk to you for a minute here ...  ,3,11
MULDER: Mrs. Kryder? My name is Fox Mulder. I'm with the FBI.  ,3,11
MULDER: We're here because we have reason to believe that Kevin may be in some danger.  ,3,11
"MULDER: As strange as it might sound, someone may be targeting people like Kevin.  ",3,11
MULDER: People exhibiting wounds that might be interpreted as having religious significance.  ,3,11
"MULDER: I'm sure there's an explanation, Mrs. Kryder, but right now everybody's primary concern should be for Kevin's safety.  ",3,11
"MULDER: Let's get out of here, Scully.  ",3,11
MULDER: They've taken him into custody. We've warned them about his safety. I don't know what else we can do.  ,3,11
"MULDER: No, not yet, but my guess is that the kid did it to himself. The boy has his father taken away. He hurts himself to relieve his dad of guilt and to get him back.  ",3,11
MULDER: He's in an institution.  ,3,11
"MULDER: Mr. Kryder, the claims you've made for your son may have put him in danger. Do you know that?  ",3,11
MULDER: They?  ,3,11
MULDER: These forces. What do they want?  ,3,11
MULDER: He's chosen you?  ,3,11
MULDER: Let's go.  ,3,11
MULDER: Excuse me?  ,3,11
"MULDER: What color hair did he have? Was it brown, or blonde, or ...  ",3,11
"MULDER: How tall was he? (he stands) Was he about my height? Taller, shorter?  ",3,11
"MULDER: About 6-2, 6-3?  ",3,11
"MULDER: We're sorry, Mrs. Kryder. We're doing everything we can. Scully ...  ",3,11
"MULDER: Yeah, looks like Kevin was abducted by Homer Simpson's evil twin.  ",3,11
MULDER: I think that's a safe assumption.  ,3,11
MULDER: None of the previous victims were ten year old boys.  ,3,11
MULDER: Yeah. We're not sure how accurate that is.  ,3,11
"MULDER: Federal agents! Put down your weapon! Put it down right here! Down, now! Put it down! (Jarvis complies) Where's the boy? Where's the boy?  ",3,11
MULDER: Where's the boy? What have you done with Kevin?  ,3,11
MULDER: Is this Kevin Kryder's blood?  ,3,11
MULDER: Did you hurt him?  ,3,11
MULDER: By who? Who asked you to protect him?  ,3,11
"MULDER: God! That's quite a long distance call, isn't it?  ",3,11
"MULDER: It's the end of the world as we know it, right?  ",3,11
"MULDER: (angrily) And he that has a tongue, let him speak. Now tell me where he is!  ",3,11
MULDER: And townsfolk wonder why I sleep in on Sunday.  ,3,11
"MULDER: Sit down, Mr. Jarvis.  ",3,11
MULDER: Hey!  ,3,11
"MULDER: Kevin, what is it?  ",3,11
MULDER: Any revelations?  ,3,11
"MULDER: You want me to smell him? (he moves around the table with a slight smile, then complies) What am I supposed to be smelling?  ",3,11
MULDER: You're serious?  ,3,11
MULDER: (smiling) And now you're suggesting that this is St. Owen?  ,3,11
"MULDER: Scully, those stories you're referring to are mostly regarded as hagiographic fabrications, not historical truths, just like the occurrence of the stigmata.  ",3,11
"MULDER: This man? He was rather abnormal in life, maybe he's decomposing abnormally.  ",3,11
MULDER: Do you really believe that?  ,3,11
MULDER: Even if science can't explain them?  ,3,11
"MULDER: Well, I wouldn't let faith overwhelm your judgement here. These people are simply fanatics behaving fanatically using religion as a justification. They give bona fide paranoiacs like myself a bad name. They're no more divine or holy than that ketchup we saw on the murdered preacher. And I think once you've finished your autopsy, you'll come to the same conclusion. St. Owen.  ",3,11
MULDER: It's what you turned up.  ,3,11
"MULDER: Those burn marks and impressions on Jarvis's neck. They pulled a pair of prints. Take a look at this. A partial index and a full oblique, burned right onto the skin.  ",3,11
"MULDER: No, not yet. But I cross-checked the prints in the NCIC database. They belong to a businessman named Simon Gates. He's the CEO of a company based in Atlanta. He's one of the wealthiest men in the south.  ",3,11
"MULDER: He was arrested three few years ago on a DUI - left a young boy paralyzed. He received a suspended sentence, then he left the country. Went to Israel.  ",3,11
MULDER: Have you heard of Jerusalem Syndrome?  ,3,11
"MULDER: Yeah, they return home convinced they're the Messiah, Moses, the Virgin Mary, even the Devil himself. Well, if that's what Simon Gates believes, he's just as delusional as Michael Kryder, only a lot more dangerous.  ",3,11
"MULDER: (on phone) Mulder. What? Well, how is that possible?  ",3,11
"MULDER: (on phone) Hold on. (to Scully) Yeah, a social worker took Kevin out to lunch at 1 o'clock supposedly, but witnesses claim they saw him outside the facility with his mother at the exact same time.  ",3,11
MULDER: Is he ready to go?  ,3,11
MULDER: Did he ID Gates?  ,3,11
"MULDER: That'll help. A man fitting Gates' description rented a car, under the name Forau. That's one of the Devil's disciples.  ",3,11
MULDER: You never draw my bath.  ,3,11
MULDER: He was in an accident.  ,3,11
MULDER: Maybe you missed it.  ,3,11
MULDER: What do you think it is?  ,3,11
MULDER: Scully ...  ,3,11
MULDER: Sure of what exactly?  ,3,11
"MULDER: That was in the Bible. It's a parable, it's a metaphor for the truth, not the truth itself. Why didn't Kevin conveniently bi-locate when Owen Jarvis abducted him from the shelter.  ",3,11
"MULDER: I wait for a miracle every day. But what I've seen here has only tested my patience, not my faith.  ",3,11
MULDER: I'll call the police.  ,3,11
MULDER: They put up a cordon in a ten-mile radius. No sign of them. Best I can figure is they must have had an acetylene torch in the back of the truck. I don't know how else they could have done it.  ,3,11
MULDER: Who?  ,3,11
MULDER: Why?  ,3,11
"MULDER: The man's a nut case, Scully.  ",3,11
"MULDER: But if Kevin is in immediate danger, even if his father has anything to say about Gates, it doesn't help us right now.  ",3,11
MULDER: Scully?  ,3,11
"MULDER: Scully. They had a sighting of Gates. He tried to rent another car at the airport, under the name Forau again. Did you hear what I said?  ",3,11
"MULDER: Scully, the man is at the airport. If he hasn't already killed Kevin, he's trying to get as far away as he can.  ",3,11
"MULDER: You think it's you, don't you? You think you're the one who's been chosen to protect Kevin.  ",3,11
MULDER: You OK?  ,3,11
MULDER: We have a couple of hours before our flight. I told the sheriff we'd go down and make a formal statement about Gates' death.  ,3,11
MULDER: OK.  ,3,11
MULDER: Mulder.  ,3,12
"MULDER: Oh, my apartment complex was being fumigated so I thought I'd get away for the weekend. I came up to Massachusetts.  ",3,12
"MULDER: No, just, uh... sitting and thinking.  ",3,12
MULDER: Scully... what are you wearing?  ,3,12
"MULDER: Isn't that what, uh, Doctor Zaius said to Charlton Heston at the end of ""Planet of the Apes?""  ",3,12
"MULDER: Scully, I got to go.  ",3,12
"MULDER: Just sitting, thinking.  ",3,12
MULDER: I heard reports of several UFO sightings in this area last night. You see anything?  ,3,12
MULDER: Any more calls tonight?  ,3,12
MULDER: No.  ,3,12
"MULDER: Oh, I was just knocking off some bugs that landed on my...  ",3,12
"MULDER: Maybe, maybe beetles. I dunno, I'm not really good with bugs.  ",3,12
MULDER: What's the matter?  ,3,12
MULDER: I think you better get up here.  ,3,12
MULDER: It appears that cockroaches are mortally attacking people.  ,3,12
MULDER: I'm crouching over a bug exterminator whose recently deceased body was discovered with cockroaches crawling all over him. The local sheriff says that two other bodies were found in the same condition this afternoon.  ,3,12
MULDER: Miller's Grove.  ,3,12
MULDER: Insect bites?  ,3,12
MULDER: No.  ,3,12
MULDER: Anaphylactic shock?  ,3,12
"MULDER: Okay, we'll check that out.  ",3,12
"MULDER: No, no, no, I'm sure you're right. Thanks, Scully.  ",3,12
MULDER: My drug dealer.  ,3,12
"MULDER: I take it back, Scully, I think you better get up here.  ",3,12
"MULDER: Yeah, and this was no allergic reaction. Two witnesses claim they saw the victim screaming about cockroaches burrowing into him.  ",3,12
"MULDER: We haven't located any yet, but there are wounds all over the body.  ",3,12
"MULDER: Well... the victim did attempt to extract the insects using a razor blade, but we're not sure all of the incisions are self-inflicted, except for the severed artery.  ",3,12
"MULDER: Uh, well, he did have a homemade lab set up, but I'm not sure what he was producing.  ",3,12
MULDER: Ekbom's Syndrome?  ,3,12
"MULDER: No, uh, you're probably right. I'm sorry to bother you.  ",3,12
MULDER: How about some urine? For a drug test.  ,3,12
MULDER: Get me a container.  ,3,12
MULDER: It must have molted. It's just empty exoskeleton.  ,3,12
"MULDER: We've got more than that, sheriff. I think that bug's exoskeleton was made of metal.  ",3,12
MULDER: An abrasion caused by a metallic substance?  ,3,12
MULDER: What do you need to tell me?  ,3,12
MULDER: I don't know.  ,3,12
MULDER: I wouldn't know.  ,3,12
MULDER: He's upset that I don't know what's going on here.  ,3,12
"MULDER: I see the correlation, but just because I work for the federal government doesn't mean I'm an expert on cockroaches.  ",3,12
MULDER: Experiments?  ,3,12
MULDER: What are you suggesting?  ,3,12
"MULDER: You might want to keep that theory to yourself, sheriff. No need to create a panic.  ",3,12
MULDER: I don't see any roaches.  ,3,12
MULDER: Hmm. He doesn't appear odd in any...  ,3,12
"MULDER: The medical examiner. His body was found next to a toilet, covered in roaches.  ",3,12
MULDER: Yeah.  ,3,12
MULDER: Brain aneurysm?  ,3,12
"MULDER: Well, how do you explain the roaches, though?  ",3,12
MULDER: Almost.  ,3,12
MULDER: Mulder.  ,3,12
MULDER: Do they attack people?  ,3,12
MULDER: But do they attack people?  ,3,12
"MULDER: Well, that all makes perfect sense, Scully. I don't like it at all. Did you know that the federal government, under the guise as the department of agriculture, as been conducting secret experiments up here?  ",3,12
"MULDER: It's too late, I'm already inside.  ",3,12
MULDER: I'm a house. It's apparently empty.  ,3,12
"MULDER: It's a, uh... typical two-story suburban house. Nice big living room, sparsely furnished...  ",3,12
MULDER: Yeah. They're rippling.  ,3,12
MULDER: Cockroaches. They're everywhere.  ,3,12
MULDER: Flashlight went out...  ,3,12
MULDER: Got to go.  ,3,12
MULDER: I'm a federal agent.  ,3,12
"MULDER: Agent Mulder, F.B.I.  ",3,12
"MULDER: Doctor Berenbaum, I'm going to have to ask you a few questions.  ",3,12
MULDER: What's a woman like you doing in a place like this?  ,3,12
MULDER: Why all the secrecy about your research? You've got some of the good townspeople suspicious.  ,3,12
"MULDER: Yeah... but those, those cockroaches... are they, uh, a normal species?  ",3,12
"MULDER: Have you ever come across, uh, a type of cockroach that, uh, is attracted to people?  ",3,12
"MULDER: Really. So, you've never seen an instance where a cockroach actually attacks a human being?  ",3,12
MULDER: Nose?  ,3,12
MULDER: What is that supposed to prove?  ,3,12
"MULDER: As, uh... as nocturnal insect swarms. That's, uh... that's fascinating.  ",3,12
MULDER: Honest?  ,3,12
"MULDER: No. No, actually, I, I find it quite refreshing.  ",3,12
MULDER: I can't sleep.  ,3,12
MULDER: They're conducting legitimate experiments.  ,3,12
MULDER: No. But she did tell me everything else there is to know about insects.  ,3,12
MULDER: Bambi also has this theory I've never come acro...  ,3,12
"MULDER: Doctor Berenbaum. Anyway, her theory is...  ",3,12
MULDER: Yeah. Both her parents were naturalists. Her theory is that UFOs are actually nocturnal insect swarms passing through electrical air fields.  ,3,12
"MULDER: Scully, can I confess something to you?  ",3,12
MULDER: I hate insects.  ,3,12
"MULDER: No, no, I'm not afraid of them. I hate them. One day back when I was a kid, I, uh... I was climbing this tree when I noticed this leaf walking towards me. It took forever for me to realize that it was no leaf.  ",3,12
"MULDER: Yeah, I had a praying mantis epiphany and, as a result, I screamed. No, not... not a girlie scream, but the scream of someone being confronted by some before unknown monster that had no right existing on the same planet I inhabited. Did you ever notice how a praying mantis' head resembles an alien's head? I mean, the mysteries of the natural world were revealed to me that day, but instead of being astounded, I was... repulsed.  ",3,12
"MULDER: Oh, I got to go.  ",3,12
MULDER: One of the motel guests died.  ,3,12
"MULDER: Scully, I think this man died from simply from a reaction to the cockroaches.  ",3,12
"MULDER: No, I... I'm saying that I think this mans imply had a heart attack.  ",3,12
MULDER: Maybe not. All your conjectures have proved correct. The exterminator did die from anaphylactic shock. The teenage boy did die from self-inflicted wounds and was getting high off methane fumes derived from burning manure. The medical examiner did die from a brain aneurysm.  ,3,12
MULDER: Or the fact that their exoskeletons are made of metal.  ,3,12
MULDER: Whatever.  ,3,12
MULDER: Can you tell what kind of cockroach it is?  ,3,12
MULDER: Is it abnormal?  ,3,12
MULDER: Does it still look unusual?  ,3,12
MULDER: You're implying that this insect is mechanical?  ,3,12
MULDER: He works out of this town?  ,3,12
MULDER: Doctor Ivanov?  ,3,12
MULDER: So this one is just programmed to head towards any object moving within the field of its sensors?  ,3,12
MULDER: Then why is it following me?  ,3,12
MULDER: Your contract is with NASA?  ,3,12
"MULDER: I'm just speculating here, but if extraterrestrial lifeforms do exist...  ",3,12
"MULDER: And assuming that they're more technologically advanced than we are, and if your own ideas about the future of space exploration are correct, then...  ",3,12
MULDER: Can you identify this?  ,3,12
MULDER: Try it under the microscope.  ,3,12
"MULDER: Oh, Doctor, I, uh... I appreciate you taking the time to, uh... answer my questions.  ",3,12
MULDER: Greetings from planet Earth.  ,3,12
MULDER: Even the...  ,3,12
MULDER: Mulder.  ,3,12
MULDER: Where are you?  ,3,12
MULDER: Manure?  ,3,12
"MULDER: Scully, if an alien civilization were technologically advanced enough to build and send artificially intelligent robotic probes to the farthest reaches of space, might they not have also been able to perfect the extraction of methane fuel from manure?  ",3,12
MULDER: Where's the research facility located?  ,3,12
"MULDER: Wait, Bambi. You better wait here until I make sure it's safe.  ",3,12
"MULDER: Well, I'm not so much worried about the cockroaches than I am about the human element.  ",3,12
MULDER: Doctor Eckerle?  ,3,12
"MULDER: You're not in any danger, these insects won't harm you.  ",3,12
MULDER: They weren't responsible for those deaths... but they might be responsible for ours if you continue firing your gun in a plant full of methane gas.  ,3,12
"MULDER: In Madagascar, they have roaches that hiss by blowing air through the holes in their upper thorax.  ",3,12
"MULDER: I don't. That's why we shouldn't kill these, but capture them for further study. Now, please... put the gun down.  ",3,12
MULDER: No. You've just had a very stressful day that's affected your ability to think clearly. Your judgment is a little clouded right now.  ,3,12
"MULDER: I assure you, Doctor Eckerle, I'm just as human as you are... if not more so.  ",3,12
"MULDER: Get out, Scully! This whole place could blow!  ",3,12
"MULDER: Or anything else, for that matter.  ",3,12
"MULDER: Well, they're completely desiccated... just like the molted exoskeleton.  ",3,12
"MULDER: Well, I've already had a similar sample analyzed, it's nothing but common metals. What do you hope to find from it?  ",3,12
"MULDER: You know, I never thought I'd say this to you, Scully... but you smell bad.  ",3,12
"MULDER: The development of our cerebral cortex has been the greatest achievement of the evolutionary processes. Big deal. While allowing us the thrills of intellect and the pangs of self-consciousness, it is all too often overruled by our inner, instinctive brain, the one that tells us to react, not reflect, to run rather than ruminate.  ",3,12
MULDER: The detective who contacted me told me to turn left.  ,3,13
MULDER: Stoplight.  ,3,13
"MULDER: Well, Im sure she meant stop sign.  ",3,13
MULDER: And your fact sheet said that theres strong suspicions of a satanic cult at work?  ,3,13
"MULDER: If, eh, you detect a hint of skepticism or incredulity in agent Scullys voice, thats because of the overwhelming evidence gathered by the FBI debunking virtually all claims of ritual abuse by satanic cults.  ",3,13
MULDER: Dont ask me  ,3,13
"MULDER: You dont suppose shes a virgin, do you?  ",3,13
MULDER: (to Scully) Maybe were just imagining that.  ,3,13
"MULDER: If you detect a hint of impatience in agent Scullys voice, thats because the FBIs study also found that in most cases, like the McWarren preschool trial, witnesses were often prompted in their statements by rumors of stories that were being circulated and that there was in fact nothing to support them.  ",3,13
MULDER: Dont ask me  ,3,13
"MULDER: Yeah, I see it, it looks like a, eh, goat, some kinda horned beast.  ",3,13
"MULDER: (Pointing at burning that indeed looks kinda like a horned beast.) Yeah, right here, in this circle.  ",3,13
"MULDER: (To Scully) If its no bother, if its not too big a deal, maybe you can get me a few photographs of that thing which bears absolutely no resemblance to a horned beast.  ",3,13
"MULDER: Oh, hi.  ",3,13
"MULDER: He was scratching to get in and I thought, with the threat of satanic animal sacrifices looming, maybe you should keep him inside. (Hands over cat.)  ",3,13
"MULDER: Eh, first off, Id like to apologize for my partners rude behavior, she tends to be rather rigid, but, but rigid in a wonderful way, not like she was today. Personally, Id like to try to keep a more open mind.  ",3,13
MULDER: I was hoping you could help me solve the mystery of the horny beast.    ,3,13
"MULDER: Do you see a, a goat here, some kinda beast?  ",3,13
"MULDER: Well, what do you think is going on, if I may ask?  ",3,13
MULDER: What do you mean seen it coming?  ,3,13
MULDER: On what?  ,3,13
"MULDER: An electrical surge caused a power failure, but somehow activated the motor that retracts the blenches and he got caught inside of them.  ",3,13
MULDER: I went to follow up a lead with detective White.  ,3,13
MULDER: You see what?  ,3,13
MULDER: I didnt ditch you!  ,3,13
"MULDER: That man, is he always that hysterical?  ",3,13
MULDER: Go ahead  ,3,13
"MULDER: No, no, be my guest. I know how much you like snapping on the latex.  ",3,13
"MULDER: (Pointing at a tag) Whats that, what is that, right there, that some kind of lettering there?  ",3,13
MULDER: Whos doctor Godfrey?  ,3,13
"MULDER: This may not be any time to mention it, but someone is wearing my favorite perfume.  ",3,13
MULDER: What?  ,3,13
"MULDER: (Loses interest, starts sniffling the air, closing in around Scullys head.)  ",3,13
MULDER: (slightly distracted.) Must be detective White  ,3,13
MULDER: What? (surprised/incredulous) What are you talking about?  ,3,13
"MULDER: We came down here because of three unexplained deaths, detective White is just trying to solve them. She could use our help.  ",3,13
MULDER: What happened?  ,3,13
MULDER: Nothing.  ,3,13
"MULDER: Yes, I, I have, which is funny, because I usually, I normally never, I dont drink.  ",3,13
"MULDER: (Kinda fuzzy) Actually, Im sure I could eh, get you another room.  ",3,13
"MULDER: Maybe we should just watch some television. Theres a movie on TV, actually, its the same movie on every channel.  ",3,13
MULDER: Was it a murder?  ,3,13
MULDER: Let me drive  ,3,13
"MULDER: Scully, its not what you think  ",3,13
MULDER: Will you let me drive!?  ,3,13
"MULDER: No. I was just never sure your little feet could reach the pedals. (Closes Scullys door, then to White: ) Will you go with her, please? Thank you. (To Himself: ) Big macho-man  ",3,13
MULDER: When we were here before you s  ,3,13
MULDER: Im a federal agent.  ,3,13
MULDER: You said that you knew why people are behaving so strangely around here.  ,3,13
MULDER: You said it was planetary?  ,3,13
MULDER: Thats a bad thing?  ,3,13
MULDER: Why here?  ,3,13
MULDER: (question-mark face)  ,3,13
MULDER: Why is this affecting everyone?  ,3,13
MULDER: What if today was my birthday?  ,3,13
MULDER: (?)  ,3,13
MULDER: (filling in check when his phone rings) Mulder  ,3,13
MULDER: Who is this?  ,3,13
"MULDER: Where are you, Margi? Just tell me where you are    ",3,13
"MULDER: Come on, Margi, lets get you out of here.  ",3,13
MULDER: Who?  ,3,13
MULDER: She killed all the high school boys.  ,3,13
MULDER: How did she do it?    ,3,13
"MULDER: Scully, its me.  ",3,13
"MULDER: Im at a crime scene, a new one. I think I have a solid lead on these deaths.  ",3,13
MULDER: Whos that?  ,3,13
MULDER: (walking out of Margis hearing range) (to Margi) Hold on a second (to Scully) Margi Kleinjan?  ,3,13
"MULDER: Actually, Im way ahead of you, Scully, because Im standing here with Margi Kleinjan and she just gave me a statement implicating her friend.  ",3,13
MULDER: Terri.  ,3,13
MULDER: You what?  ,3,13
"MULDER: Look, Scully, I dont think this has anything to do with any cult. I wanna get them both in and get a formal statement and clear this thing up, okay?  ",3,13
MULDER: Scully?  ,3,13
"MULDER: Wait right here (starts walking away, then turns to ask:) Detective Whites cat?  ",3,13
"MULDER: (sighs and walks away, then hears sabre dance and looks at TV: the movie from the other night in the motel)  ",3,13
MULDER: (points at Margi) Get her outta here.  ,3,13
MULDER: Something cosmic.  ,3,13
MULDER/SCULLY: Put that gun down!  ,3,13
MULDER: Who?  ,3,13
MULDER: Theyre both in here.  ,3,13
MULDER: You dont wanna go in there.  ,3,13
"MULDER: We are but visitors on this rock, hurling through time and space at sixty-six (Voice-only) thousand miles an hour. Tethered to a burning sphere by an invisible force and an unfathomable universe. This most of us take for granted while refusing to believe these forces have any more effect on us than a butterfly beating its wings halfway around the world. Or that two girls, born on the same date, the same time and the same place, might not find themselves the unfortunate focus of similar unseen forces. Converging like the planets themselves into burning pinpoints of cosmic energy, whose absolute gravity would threaten to swallow and consume everything in its path. Or maybe the answer lies even further from our grasp.  ",3,13
MULDER: Youre the driver.  ,3,13
"MULDER: Eh, Scully, if Im not mistaken, were gonna be taking a left up here.  ",3,13
"MULDER: Eh, theres an intersection up here, youre gonna wanna  ",3,13
"MULDER: Scully! Youre gonna, wanna!  ",3,13
"MULDER: You just. ran a stop sign back there, Scully.  ",3,13
"MULDER: Sure, fine, whatever.  ",3,13
"MULDER: (Voice over) He's an unemployed painter, divorced, no children. He came to the US from Uzbekistan during Perestroika. He failed to mention on his INS application that he spent the better part of his twenties in an insane asylum.  ",3,14
MULDER: You thought all they produced were great hockey players. The crimes took place over a three year period. All the victims were male. Aged 17 to 25.  ,3,14
"MULDER: Well, according to the ME there was no evidence of any sexual assault. Death was caused by massive blood loss due to facial mutilation. We also reported that the wound pattern on all the victims was identical. It's all there on page three.  ",3,14
"MULDER: Or individuals, if you count the spirit Mostow says possessed him during the murders.  ",3,14
MULDER: That was the operational opinion until last night...  ,3,14
MULDER: When a 19 year old male was found dead six miles from here with an identical set of facial wounds.  ,3,14
"MULDER: Well, according to Assistant Director Skinner, who asked us to look into this case, the details of the mutilations were never released. Only members of the crime team would have that information. And Mostow's been in custody for five days.  ",3,14
MULDER: Cuz he's been working.  ,3,14
"MULDER: Haven't you, John? What is it? What is this thing?  ",3,14
MULDER: Does it have a name? Does it have a name to go with that face?  ,3,14
MULDER: What do you call it? Satan? The devil?  ,3,14
"MULDER: Scully, this is Bill Patterson. He runs the investigative support unit out of Quantico.  ",3,14
"MULDER: That's what always amazed me about you, Bill. You never fit your own profile. No one would ever guess how really mean-spirited you are.  ",3,14
MULDER: You think he's got an accomplice then. Even though your own profile of Mostow states that he's most certainly working alone.  ,3,14
MULDER: What about these drawings of Mostow's? The gargoyles?  ,3,14
MULDER: I didn't get a chance to...  ,3,14
"MULDER: Well, that would make sense. Historically, that's what gargoyles have been used for. To ward off evil spirits. Like on the eaves of buildings.  ",3,14
MULDER: I was asked to look into this case. If you've got a problem with that I suggest you take it up with AD Skinner.  ,3,14
MULDER: Patterson never liked me.  ,3,14
MULDER: Not by Patterson.  ,3,14
MULDER: Didn't want to get my knees dirty.  ,3,14
MULDER: Couldn't quite cast myself in the role of the dutiful student.  ,3,14
MULDER: Something like that. Yeah.  ,3,14
"MULDER: Yeah, Patterson had this thing about wanting to track a killer, to know an artist, you have to look at his art. It really meant, if you want to catch a monster, you have to become one yourself.  ",3,14
MULDER: This guy is definitely some kind of monster.  ,3,14
MULDER: It's just a cat...  ,3,14
MULDER: No. He obviously has his own key to the place.  ,3,14
MULDER: There's air coming through here. There could be something on the other side of the wall.  ,3,14
MULDER: I've got some light.  ,3,14
"MULDER: More gargoyles, Scully. Lots of them. Sculpted in clay.  ",3,14
"MULDER: The name is from the French ""gargouille"". The name of a medieval dragon that prowled the river Seine. Whose horrible image became the symbol of the soul of the condemned. Turned to stone. Or of the devils and demons of the underworld spared eternal damnation. The embodiment of the lesser forces of the universe who inspired dread, the threat of our own damnation. Ushers into hell or into the realm of our own dark fears and imagination. For over 1200 years, this grotesque image has found its expression in stone, clay, wood, oil and charcoal. Born again and again as if resurrecting itself by its own will through tortured human expression, almost as if it existed. Haunting men inwardly so that it may haunt mankind for eternity. As it must have haunted John Mostow. But what impulses moved it to kill? Could this be the same dark force at work? Its ultimate expression the destruction of the flesh? Of the very hand that creates it? Is this evil something born in each of us? Crouching in the shadow of every human soul waiting to emerge? A monster waiting to violate our bodies and twist our will to do its bidding? Is this the monster called madness?  ",3,14
MULDER: I'm not sure yet.  ,3,14
MULDER: I have a few theories. I'm just trying to stitch them together right now.  ,3,14
"MULDER: You said it yourself. If you want to know the artist, look at the art. I'm finally agreeing with you.  ",3,14
MULDER: Maybe you can also tell me why this man was compelled to sculpt and draw the same face again and again. Why he's still doing it now.  ,3,14
MULDER: He said that this thing wants to see his own reflection.  ,3,14
MULDER: Unless he's telling the truth.  ,3,14
"MULDER: Well, I wouldn't want to disappoint you by not disappointing you.  ",3,14
MULDER: It was turned off.  ,3,14
MULDER: I was working.  ,3,14
"MULDER: This thing exists, Scully. It's real.  ",3,14
MULDER: Whatever keeps killing those young men.  ,3,14
MULDER: Whoever attacked me wasn't a person.  ,3,14
"MULDER: What makes you think I'd want to see that? I didn't imagine it, Scully.  ",3,14
MULDER: Patterson?  ,3,14
MULDER: Why didn't it kill me like it killed the others? Why did it let me live?  ,3,14
"MULDER: Then help me understand, John.  ",3,14
MULDER: No.... You have to help me go deeper. You have to help me get inside his head. Just how he got inside yours so I can find out what it wants.  ,3,14
MULDER: It wants to kill innocent young men by carving up their faces?  ,3,14
MULDER: Unless I find it...  ,3,14
"MULDER: Just tell me how to find it, John.  ",3,14
MULDER: Just tell me how to find this thing.  ,3,14
MULDER: Scully?  ,3,14
MULDER: I'm at Mostow's studio.  ,3,14
MULDER: No. Should I be?  ,3,14
MULDER: I'm not sure.  ,3,14
MULDER: What makes you say that?  ,3,14
MULDER: When?  ,3,14
MULDER: Yeah. I examined Mostow's knife yesterday in the evidence room.  ,3,14
MULDER: Because I wanted to hold it. Wanted to see what it felt like in my hand.  ,3,14
"MULDER: Look... Scully, I didn't take it.  ",3,14
MULDER: Yeah.  ,3,14
MULDER: What are you doing here?  ,3,14
MULDER: It's Nemhauser.  ,3,14
"MULDER: But you already knew that, didn't you? You killed him, Bill. When he suspected it was you... You killed him.  ",3,14
MULDER: Not me. Not now.  ,3,14
MULDER: Not until you tell me what you're doing here.  ,3,14
MULDER: Look at your hands.  ,3,14
MULDER: Now ask yourself what you're doing here.  ,3,14
"MULDER: You're here because John Mostow stole three years of your life. Every day and every night for three years you lived and breathed the horror show that was in his head and I'm sorry... imagining everything that he imagined. Sinking deeper and deeper into the ugliness that you taught us to do. When you finally caught him, it didn't just go away, and the violence... it stayed alive inside you ... til it had to come out. You didn't want to do what you were doing. You wanted to stop but you couldn't. Not by yourself. That's why you called on me in the first place, why you couldn't kill me when you had the chance.  ",3,14
"MULDER: Scully, get that light off me!  ",3,14
MULDER: You don't understand!  ,3,14
"MULDER: It's him, Scully.  ",3,14
MULDER: This is Agent Mulder FBI. There's a man down... gunshot wound.  ,3,14
MULDER: We work in the dark. We do what we can to battle the evil that would otherwise destroy us.  ,3,14
"MULDER: But if a man's character is his fate, it's not a choice but a calling. Sometimes the weight of this burden causes us to falter. From the fragile fortress of our mind. Allowing the monster without to turn within. We are left alone staring into the abyss. Into the laughing face of madness.  ",3,14
MULDER: Yeah?  ,3,15
MULDER: Anything up?  ,3,15
"MULDER: Something interesting came into my attention last night. A French salvage ship, the Piper Maru, limped into port in San Diego yesterday, all the way from the north Pacific.  ",3,15
"MULDER: Using the national weather service satellite system, I was able to track its course. This was its original position.  ",3,15
"MULDER: Yeah, that's where the boat we know as The Talapus pulled up what you believe was a Russian sub, but what I believe was the remains of a UFO.  ",3,15
"MULDER: Look Scully, I don't know what it is but something is still down there and now the French are looking for it too.  ",3,15
MULDER: So why all the attention paid to this site? What information are they acting on?  ,3,15
MULDER: I would but the entire crew is being treated for radiation burns.  ,3,15
MULDER: The French government is keeping that information classified for some reason.  ,3,15
MULDER: I checked. It's thousands of miles away from any test sites. (Scully smiles and laughs) What?  ,3,15
MULDER: Well that's why I'm in the basement Scully.  ,3,15
MULDER: Is that what you think of me?  ,3,15
MULDER: Well that's good because there's some garbage in San Diego I want you to help me dig through.  ,3,15
MULDER: Dr Seizer?  ,3,15
MULDER: Special agent Mulder. This is agent Scully.  ,3,15
"MULDER: Yeah, how are they doing?  ",3,15
MULDER: Not on this planet.  ,3,15
"MULDER: How could that be? With that level of radiation, how could one man not be exposed?  ",3,15
MULDER: Could it be possible for us to talk to him?  ,3,15
"MULDER: Try the INS or the French Consulate, see what you can pull up on him.  ",3,15
"MULDER: Agents Mulder and Scully, FBI.  ",3,15
MULDER: Have you turned anything up?  ,3,15
MULDER: The crew of this ship is being treated for radiation.  ,3,15
MULDER: So it's ok for us to go on board?  ,3,15
MULDER: Feels like home.  ,3,15
"MULDER: No, I'm looking for the vcr.  ",3,15
MULDER: The dive suit has a video camera.  ,3,15
MULDER: Looks like the fuselage of a plane.  ,3,15
MULDER: I just got very turned on.  ,3,15
MULDER: Would it have been carrying anything radioactive?  ,3,15
MULDER: Then what was it those men exposed to?  ,3,15
"MULDER: Mr Gauthier?  Mr Gauthier? open the door, it's the FBI. (Mulder opens door, it's unlocked, he enters) Mr Gauthier?  ",3,15
MULDER: Mr Gauthier? I want you to lie still. I'm with the FBI. What happened?  ,3,15
MULDER: How did you get here?  ,3,15
MULDER: The Piper Maru? That's the last thing you remember?  ,3,15
MULDER: Do you know where you are?  ,3,15
MULDER: Yeah.  ,3,15
"MULDER: Nobody else's home, but somebody has been going over your papers.  ",3,15
"MULDER: She's not here, look.. you need to be careful, you have some kind of oil all over you?  ",3,15
"MULDER: I want you to remain calm, ok? I'd like to ask you a few questions about a letter. About a J. Kallenchuk Salvage Brokers.  ",3,15
"MULDER: Well, somebody did. And I think you know why.  ",3,15
"MULDER: My name is Mulder, I'm with the FBI.  ",3,15
MULDER: I'm looking for Mr Kallenchuk.  ,3,15
MULDER: Maybe you can tell me where I could find him.  ,3,15
MULDER: Well I've got a letter here typed on his stationary.  Maybe you typed it for him.  ,3,15
MULDER: Mulder.  ,3,15
"MULDER: Ok well, why don't you have him call me as soon as he can. (Mulder hands her his card)  ",3,15
"MULDER: Yes, what did you say your name was?  ",3,15
MULDER: Thank you Geraldine. (Mulder leaves)  ,3,15
MULDER: Mulder.  ,3,15
"MULDER: San Francisco airport, where are you?  ",3,15
MULDER: What?  ,3,15
MULDER: Says who?  ,3,15
MULDER: That was the name we saw written on that dive chart right?  ,3,15
"MULDER: Why if they knew about it, why wait 50 years to try to recover it? And why was the only person not exposed, the diver, sent down to find it.  ",3,15
MULDER: Why don't you try to find out?  ,3,15
MULDER: I gotta go to Hong Kong.  ,3,15
"MULDER: Yeah, look, uh..(going into the gate) I'm gonna miss my flight, so uh... I gotta call you back ok?  ",3,15
"MULDER: Is this seat taken Miss Kallenchuk? Geraldine Kallenchuk, isn't it?  ",3,15
"MULDER: I noticed you flew 1st class, must be good money selling classified government secrets.  ",3,15
MULDER: How much for the location of that P-51 Mustang you sold the French government?  ,3,15
MULDER: Actually I'd rather know who sold you the secret.  ,3,15
MULDER: Why did you run off to Hong Kong?  ,3,15
MULDER: To sell him what?  ,3,15
MULDER: Oh your buyer's a woman.  ,3,15
MULDER: Actually you know it is my damn business because whatever you're selling is killing half a dozen sailors in a California Hospital. Which is why I'm gonna arrest you.  ,3,15
"MULDER: I just did it, now let's make a deal.  ",3,15
MULDER: You gave up your civil rights when you committed treason.  ,3,15
"MULDER: Open it. (she does nothing, so Mulder kicks the door open) Pardon my gender type, but after you. (he pushes Geraldine in)  Where are the lights?  ",3,15
MULDER: Krycek. I thought guns were against the law here.  ,3,15
MULDER: Why don't you take that gun and shoot yourself in your head like you shot my father?  ,3,15
"MULDER: It's no way to treat your business partner, especially since she's been moving those secrets you've been selling so well.  ",3,15
MULDER: Damn. (he tries to reach the dropped key on the floor)  ,3,15
MULDER: That's for your partner.  (he kicks him under the belt) This is for me  (Mulder draws Krycek's gun and points it at his gut)  And this is for my father (Krycek has blood all over his face)  ,3,15
MULDER: Now you tell me.  ,3,15
MULDER: Oh yeah? Then who was it?  ,3,15
MULDER: Either way Krycek you're a liar.  ,3,15
MULDER: I want that digital tape.  ,3,15
"MULDER: Like hell you don't, it contains the secrets you were selling as well as everything else our government knows about the existence of extra terrestrial life .  ",3,15
"MULDER: Obviously, you found a way.  ",3,15
MULDER: Where is it?  ,3,15
"MULDER: You put that tape in my hands and we'll talk about it. Why don't you go to the bathrooms and clean yourself off? If you're not out of there in 3 minutes, I'm coming in there to kill you.  ",3,15
MULDER: Feel better?  ,3,15
MULDER: Give me the key.  ,3,16
"MULDER: I wanna make sure we get there together, give it to me. (Krycek hands mulder the key: yellow with C.I. 517 on it) What's ""C.I."" mean?  ",3,16
MULDER: We're being followed. A dark sedan with its lights off. It was parked on the shoulder about half a mile back. Speed up. (pointing his gun at Krycek) Speed up!  ,3,16
MULDER: Guess I'm not dead.  ,3,16
MULDER: Maybe you can tell me.  ,3,16
MULDER: We were run off the road by 2 men.  ,3,16
MULDER: Krycek.  ,3,16
"MULDER: He was in Hong Kong, he's got the digital tape. He's been selling information.  ",3,16
MULDER: They ordered him out of the car. I thought they were going to kill him. I though they were going to kill us both. And then there was this bright flash. That's all I remember.  ,3,16
MULDER: What's his condition?  ,3,16
MULDER: Who shot him?  ,3,16
MULDER: What are those?  ,3,16
MULDER: Yeah and who's this one belong to?  ,3,16
MULDER: It looked great on me in the store.  ,3,16
MULDER: I had it flown it from San Diego as evidence.  ,3,16
"MULDER: The suit was covered in a thin film of oil, as was the French diver when I found him lying delirious on his kitchen floor.  ",3,16
"MULDER: Well from the reports I'm getting, it's the same substance that was found on the French diver's wife when she was discovered on the floor of a Hong Kong airport bathroom a few days ago. According to the analysis, it's 50-weight diesel oil. It's the same oil that was used during World War II submarines and on P-51 Mustangs for that matter.  ",3,16
"MULDER: This oil is not only 50 years old Scully, but its composition has been altered by exposure to radiation.  ",3,16
"MULDER: This just wasn't ordinary diesel oil, I think it's huh.. I think it's a medium, a medium being used by some kind of alien creature that uses it to .. body jump.  ",3,16
"MULDER: I think that it came off of whatever they pulled from the bottom of the Pacific ocean, it's been waiting 50 years down there for another host, another body to bring it up to the surface.  ",3,16
MULDER: And then into Krycek.  ,3,16
"MULDER: I think that Mrs Gauthier went to Hong Kong under the control of this thing (Scully laughs) to find Krycek. I know, I know how it sounds.  ",3,16
"MULDER: No but I think that the 64 thousand dollar question is what is this thing looking for? And now that it's in Krycek, what does it want?  ",3,16
MULDER: You mean if I want somebody whacked on the knee with a lead pipe?  ,3,16
MULDER: It's gone.  ,3,16
MULDER: Let me see that.  ,3,16
MULDER: Hand me a pencil.  ,3,16
"MULDER: Actually, it's a phone number, New York City area code (212), 555 1012. Now don't drop that (giving the pencil to Frohike) that's a finely calibrated piece of investigative equipment. I gotta make a phone call. (Frohike is puzzled)  ",3,16
MULDER: Who is this?  ,3,16
MULDER: You probably know. A man named Krycek.  ,3,16
"MULDER: Yeah nice guy, killed my father, you wouldn't happen to know where he is, do you?  ",3,16
MULDER: It's so nice of you to remember.  ,3,16
MULDER: I would love to.  ,3,16
"MULDER: We're all alone in New York City, sir.  ",3,16
MULDER: What for?  ,3,16
"MULDER: No, you'll answer a few questions for me first, like what was pulled off the bottom of the Pacific ocean.  ",3,16
MULDER: Left out until now?  ,3,16
MULDER: Almost the entire crew died.  ,3,16
MULDER: A mystery to whom?  ,3,16
MULDER: I know.  ,3,16
MULDER: You give me Krycek and I will tell you.  ,3,16
MULDER: You haven't told me anything I didn't already know.  ,3,16
MULDER: 'Cause he has the tape.  ,3,16
"MULDER: The tape he's been selling those secrets off.  (The Well-Manicured Man is surprised) You don't know where he is either, do you? (the Well-Manicured man smiles) You're looking for him too.  ",3,16
"MULDER: Scully it's me. (Mulder's calling from his cell phone) The 2 guards you had posted in front of Skinner's room, are they still there?  ",3,16
"MULDER: I want you to get down there and double check for me, ok?  ",3,16
"MULDER: Just get down there and check, ok?  ",3,16
MULDER: Yeah Mulder.  ,3,16
MULDER: At the airport in New York.  ,3,16
MULDER: I'm looking for my rental car agreement.  ,3,16
MULDER: I'll tell you when I see you.  ,3,16
MULDER: Who?  ,3,16
MULDER: Scully..  ,3,16
"MULDER: I want you to meet me at the DC airport in an hour, I want you to get 2 tickets on the 1st flight for North Dakota.  ",3,16
MULDER: The salvaged UFO.  ,3,16
MULDER: I didn't sign any disarmament treaty. (they draw their guns and enter the 1st silo)  ,3,16
MULDER: We're 8 stories down.  ,3,16
"MULDER: Apparently, nobody else signed that treaty either.  ",3,16
MULDER: These tunnels must go on for miles.  ,3,16
MULDER: He's here.  ,3,16
"MULDER: He's here. You led him here, didn't you?  ",3,16
MULDER: Why are you here? Why all these men?  ,3,16
"MULDER: The UFO's here. That's what Krycek's after, isn't it?  ",3,16
MULDER: You won't get away with this! You can't bury the truth!  ,3,16
MULDER: Yeah.  ,3,16
"MULDER (stands up and shakes Skinner's hand and helps him to the chair): Sir, I didn't expect you back to work for a few weeks.  ",3,16
"MULDER: Actually I wanted to talk to you, I wanted to thank you for everything you did.  ",3,16
MULDER: You got a shot because you stood up to these people.  ,3,16
"MULDER: From what I understand, you put your job and your life on the line for Scully.  ",3,16
MULDER: What do you mean mistakenly?  ,3,16
"MULDER: It's interesting, I never thought of it that way.  ",3,16
"MULDER: I came here to tell you something (they start walking away) there may be some justice, just not the kind you're looking for.  ",3,16
"MULDER: They found this man, Luis Cardinal, dead in his cell.  ",3,16
MULDER: They made it look like a suicide. The men he worked for couldn't take the chance that he point his finger at them.  ,3,16
MULDER: Oh he was there. I know that.  ,3,16
"MULDER: I don't know, but if they haven't they will. I doubt it'll weight on their consciences though.  ",3,16
MULDER: What's his story?  ,3,17
MULDER: So you think that Pusher somehow talked him into doing this? He willed him into doing that?  ,3,17
MULDER: Ro-neen. It's a samurai without a master.  ,3,17
MULDER: It means I bet I know ten-to-one what this guy's got stacked on the back of his toilet.  ,3,17
"MULDER: Oh, thanks.  ",3,17
MULDER: They get him?  ,3,17
MULDER: Samurais without masters have to advertise.  ,3,17
"MULDER: Suggestion is a powerful force. The science of hypnosis is predicated on it, as are most TV commercials. I mean, they're designed to plant thoughts in your head.  ",3,17
"MULDER: But the mechanism of suggestion is the same. It's just a lot more powerful in this case. I mean, this guy calls himself ""Pusher."" Can't we take that to mean that he pushes his will onto other people?  ",3,17
MULDER: Maybe he really didn't want to go to jail.  ,3,17
MULDER: Look at this.  ,3,17
"MULDER: No, it's a northern Virginia area code. I've seen this ad in all these magazines dating back to April, 1994.  ",3,17
MULDER: O-S-U... O-S... U...  ,3,17
MULDER: Hey. I think you drooled on me.  ,3,17
"MULDER: It's, uh... twenty to three.  ",3,17
"MULDER: No, nothing here, nothing at the other two payphones. I checked in with Burst. He's beginning to think it's a wild goose chase.  ",3,17
MULDER: Who is this? What's your name?  ,3,17
"MULDER: Why do I have to prove my worth to you? You think this is a game? What, do you want to be found?  ",3,17
"MULDER: ""Let your fingers do the walking.""  ",3,17
"MULDER: No, no, what if, what if Pusher was the last person to use this phone? Can you redial on these kind of phones?  ",3,17
"MULDER: Rings a bell, huh? Let's go, G-Woman.  ",3,17
"MULDER: Collins, let it go.  ",3,17
MULDER: Put that down.  ,3,17
MULDER: Federal agent!  ,3,17
"MULDER: That is correct, your honor.  ",3,17
"MULDER: We believe that they were indeed murders, your honor.  ",3,17
"MULDER: We have the defendant on audio tape confessing to the murders. On several separate occasions, he clearly identifies them as such. Furthermore, the defendant knows crime scene details that were only available to the police.  ",3,17
MULDER: But your client was present.  ,3,17
MULDER: I believe that these people died because it was the defendant's express will that they do so.  ,3,17
MULDER: This man admitted to being a killer for hire. I believe he has a unique suggestive ability which makes for the perfect M.O. He is able to talk his victims into injuring themselves.  ,3,17
"MULDER: Yesterday, a federal law enforcement officer was induced to self-immolation by the defendant. I witnessed it. All these other officers witnessed it.  ",3,17
"MULDER: A phone prank? He had the details of every case, your honor.  ",3,17
"MULDER: Hey, your shoe's untied.  ",3,17
"MULDER: Let me guess. He was an average student, he attended an average community college, he did an average stint in the military.  ",3,17
"MULDER: Not his first choice. He wanted to be a Navy Seal and then he wanted to be an Army Special Forces Green Beret. Promptly washed out of both, though not for lack of intelligence. He ended up being a supply clerk at Fort Bragg. Served two years, general discharge.  ",3,17
MULDER: You got a copy of that?  ,3,17
MULDER: Yet he wants to be in authority.  ,3,17
"MULDER: Well, ninjas are said to have the ability to cloud the minds of their opponents.  ",3,17
"MULDER: He certainly clouded the mind of that judge, Scully.  ",3,17
"MULDER: Oh, we had enough to get past a simple preliminary hearing. Modell psyched the guy out. He put the whammy on him.  ",3,17
"MULDER: I don't know, maybe, maybe it's some mental aspect of some eastern martial art. You know, the temporary suppression of the brain's chemistry, produced by a specific timbre or cadence in Modell's voice. His voice seems to be the key.  ",3,17
"MULDER: Maybe the ability came to him more recently, like in the last two years.  ",3,17
"MULDER: Well, he's laughing at us, Scully.  ",3,17
"MULDER: Excuse me, sir? Can we speak outside?  ",3,17
"MULDER: I reviewed the building's security tapes. Modell can clearly be seen entering and leaving unnoticed. He had the word ""pass"" on his lapel. Cars that waved him by don't even remember seeing him at all.  ",3,17
MULDER: What do you mean?  ,3,17
"MULDER: Yeah, for what? About the only thing we got on him now is criminal trespass.  ",3,17
MULDER: Search the whole building.  ,3,17
"MULDER: Hey, Scully, check this out.  ",3,17
MULDER: What's that?  ,3,17
MULDER: What causes epilepsy this late in life?  ,3,17
MULDER: Brain tumor? The growth of brain tumors has been linked with the reported occurrence of psychic ability.  ,3,17
"MULDER: Just, just bear with me for a second. What if Modell's suggestive ability is really a form of psychokinesis?  ",3,17
"MULDER: Well, it fits. All those protein drinks in his fridge? Maybe he's got to replenish the metabolic energy that he uses in the process of controlling somebody's will.  ",3,17
MULDER: Maybe he isn't. Maybe that's the whole point.  ,3,17
"MULDER: His exhaustion at the driving range. He didn't let us capture him. He was too sick to escape, too tired, too wiped out. Why would a, a killer who is so proficient confess to murders that he'd already gotten away with? Maybe he's dying.  ",3,17
MULDER: Not with a whimper but a bang.  ,3,17
"MULDER: Yeah, we're here.  ",3,17
MULDER: Frank...  ,3,17
MULDER: Frank...  ,3,17
"MULDER: Frank, hang up the phone.  ",3,17
MULDER: Frank...  ,3,17
MULDER: Hang up the phone.  ,3,17
"MULDER: Come on, man, hang up the phone.  ",3,17
"MULDER: Frank, hang up the phone!  ",3,17
"MULDER: Frank, hang up the phone!  ",3,17
MULDER: Hang up!  ,3,17
MULDER: Somebody hang up the phone!  ,3,17
"MULDER: Frank, hang it up!  ",3,17
MULDER: Frank!  ,3,17
MULDER: Modell?  ,3,17
"MULDER: What is it, Modell, really, what you want?  ",3,17
MULDER: Why me?  ,3,17
"MULDER: Sick old Bob Modell, right? You're dying, aren't you, Bob? What, do you want to take a few innocent people with you before you go?  ",3,17
"MULDER: Yeah, and some are more innocent than others. Now why don't you just tell me where you are?  ",3,17
"MULDER: You mean you killed this man for nothing, you sick bastard?  ",3,17
MULDER: Where's Modell calling from?  ,3,17
"MULDER: Fairfax Mercy Hospital is right down the street from there, huh?  ",3,17
"MULDER: Well, let's go find out.  ",3,17
MULDER: Hold.  ,3,17
MULDER: I think I should go in alone.  ,3,17
MULDER: What if Modell turns one of your men against the others... in a crowded hospital? I think we should give him what he wants.  ,3,17
"MULDER: We stand a better chance if we're separated. I'll go on mike. That way, you'll know what he's doing and where he is at all times.  ",3,17
MULDER: Think I get the Playboy channel?  ,3,17
MULDER: No. I wouldn't want to end up pointing it at anybody except Modell.  ,3,17
MULDER: Nothing out of the ordinary.  ,3,17
MULDER: Two shots fired.  ,3,17
"MULDER: No, not yet!  ",3,17
"MULDER: You, uh, you getting this back there?  ",3,17
"MULDER: Looks like the guard shot the technician, then he shot himself.  ",3,17
MULDER: Over here.  ,3,17
MULDER: Right here.  ,3,17
"MULDER: We're batting a thousand, Scully. Modell's dying. He's got nothing to lose.  ",3,17
"MULDER: I'm going to kill you, Modell.  ",3,17
"MULDER: Scully, run! Scully...  ",3,17
"MULDER: You know, we thought he was undergoing treatment. We were wrong.  ",3,17
"MULDER: Read his chart. The M.R.I.s were a way to gauge how much life he had left, but he consistently refused treatment. The tumor remained operable right up until the end, but he refused to have it removed.  ",3,17
MULDER: I think it was like you said. He was always such a... little man. This was finally something that made him feel big.  ,3,17
"MULDER: Well, what about the curse? The Secona believe great evil would befall anyone that disturbed the remains of an Amaru, a woman shaman  that they would be devoured by the Jaguar Spirit.  ",3,18
MULDER: (very dry) Im sure.  ,3,18
MULDER: Can we see it?  ,3,18
"MULDER: (to SCULLY) Personally, if someone digs me up in 1,000 years I hope there's a curse on them too.  ",3,18
MULDER: Do you believe the bones are cursed?  ,3,18
MULDER: He had no political feelings about the piece being brought here?  ,3,18
MULDER: Do you know where we might find him?  ,3,18
"MULDER: Yes, we would like to know. We'd be very interested in what you think. (sits beside him)  ",3,18
MULDER: Alone?  ,3,18
"MULDER: It's nice to meet people who really believe in something, isn't it?  ",3,18
MULDER: Do you think Bilac's a suspect?  ,3,18
MULDER: Based on what?  ,3,18
MULDER: He did look a little squirrely back there.  ,3,18
"MULDER: Well, let me remind you we don't have a body and not much more forensic detail than a lot of spilled blood.  ",3,18
MULDER: I'm not sure he did anything.  ,3,18
"MULDER: Go with it, Scully.  ",3,18
MULDER: They turn up a body?  ,3,18
"MULDER: If Dr. Lewton was brought through here, it's going to be hard to determine. It looks like it rained pretty hard last night.  ",3,18
MULDER: Maybe somebody didn't want that car started.  ,3,18
MULDER: Why not?  ,3,18
MULDER: Rats?  ,3,18
MULDER: Whats he estimate on the time of death?  ,3,18
MULDER: That's about the same time as Craig Horning.  ,3,18
MULDER: I dont know.  ,3,18
MULDER: Why?  ,3,18
MULDER: I think its starting to rain again.  ,3,18
MULDER: What the hell is that? (wipes at his temple in disgust)  ,3,18
MULDER: Do we know for sure it's Lewton?  ,3,18
MULDER: A man of taste.  ,3,18
MULDER: Torn or pulled?  ,3,18
MULDER: By what?  ,3,18
MULDER: More rats.  ,3,18
MULDER: Looking for Mona Wustner. I got a panicked call from her.  ,3,18
"MULDER: Yeah, where is she?  ",3,18
MULDER: (on phone) Mulder.  ,3,18
"MULDER: (on phone) No, but her car is parked outside. Shes not here. Did you find Bilac?  ",3,18
MULDER: (on phone) Is there a date of entry on that?  ,3,18
MULDER: (on phone) Read about the jaguar coming down from the trees again.  ,3,18
MULDER: (on phone) Maybe thats how the intestines got up there.  ,3,18
MULDER: (on phone) What the hells that supposed to mean?  ,3,18
MULDER: (on phone) What's he want from her?  ,3,18
"MULDER: (on phone) Scully, I'm going to have to call you back.  ",3,18
MULDER: (on phone) I hope not. (hangs up)  ,3,18
"MULDER: What are you doing here? (no answer) I said, what are you doing here?  ",3,18
"MULDER: (from the bathroom) Hey, Scully! Come here for a second. (she joins him) Just dawned on me. Why do you think there's so much water in here?  ",3,18
"MULDER: There's water on every seat. It's more like every toilet overflowed. Now, why would that happen?  ",3,18
MULDER: (not thrilled) I hate this.  ,3,18
MULDER: Rats.  ,3,18
MULDER: In every toilet.  ,3,18
MULDER: Yeah.  ,3,18
MULDER: (to SCULLY) Finally a body.  ,3,18
MULDER: Someone fed this dog rat poison?  ,3,18
"MULDER: And the dog ate the cat. (SCULLY gives him a small smile.) More rats, Scully.  ",3,18
MULDER: Don't you think that's significant?  ,3,18
MULDER: There were rats in Dr. Lewton's car engine. There were rats in the bathroom where it looks like Mona might have been killed and now here.  ,3,18
"MULDER: No, no. I think its more than that. What is it that the Secona believe? That the jaguar spirit will devour anybody that desecrates the burial place of a holy woman. Essentially, theyre talking about transmigration of the soul into animal form achieved through a ceremony where they drink, the uh...  ",3,18
MULDER: Yeah. To summon the spirits.  ,3,18
"MULDER: No, I think those rats were killed trying to escape from something.  ",3,18
"MULDER: No, the lids were down. They werent trying to get into the toilets, they were trying to get out. They were coming from within the sewer lines trying to get away from something.  ",3,18
"MULDER: Go with it, Scully.  ",3,18
MULDER: What about a rat?  ,3,18
MULDER: You ever see any rats in this room?  ,3,18
MULDER: How do you think they get in here?  ,3,18
"MULDER: Hey, Scully, take a look at this.  ",3,18
MULDER: (feeling the floor just inside the vent) How do you get down there?  ,3,18
MULDER: (holds up his hand with blood on it) Unless he was dragged.  ,3,18
MULDER: And only one way in.  ,3,18
MULDER: (looking hopefully at SCULLY) Ladies first?  ,3,18
MULDER: Which way?  ,3,18
MULDER: Follow that rat.  ,3,18
MULDER: (urgent) Scully? Scully?!  ,3,18
MULDER: We still dont know by what.  ,3,18
MULDER: I think its a cat.  ,3,18
"MULDER: No, *these* cats. Which way is out?  ",3,18
"MULDER: Come on, Scully!  ",3,18
MULDER: Can you reach up in there?  ,3,18
MULDER: Lets pull him down.  ,3,18
"MULDER: (on phone) Okay, I will call you back later.  ",3,18
MULDER: What about the cats?  ,3,18
"MULDER: Well, we both saw them down there, Scully. We know theyre down there.  ",3,18
"MULDER: Well, by then it wont even matter.  ",3,18
MULDER: I just got off the phone with the Assistant Secretary of States office. Theyve called in the Ecuadorean Ambassador.  ,3,18
MULDER: Five people had to die but they're finally taking it seriously.  ,3,18
MULDER: (short laugh) No. Bilac's letter of protest. The State Department has asked that the museum remain closed until they can act officially on it.  ,3,18
MULDER: The urn will be back in Ecuador by the end of the week.  ,3,18
"MULDER: (voiceover as camera pans over artifacts in the museum) The Suffolk county coroner ruled the deaths at the museum were the result of animal attacks. What motivated these attacks and why no more have occurred since has not been explained. To the museum, the urn was an artifact from a dying culture-- its curse merely a primitive superstition. Dr. Bilac learned there is a world beyond our own, unseen but powerful, and as real as the urn itself.  ",3,18
MULDER: (voiceover) The icons from that world represent forces that cannot be tamed or collected in a museum. The true curse that struck the museum was the failure to understand that there are powers that should not be disturbed... That some things are better left buried.  ,3,18
"MULDER: Eleventh time, actually. There were three in Seattle, three in Los Angeles and two in Boston, all Chinese men between the ages of 20 and 40. All recent immigrants.  ",3,19
MULDER: Lucky? Thats an interesting word for it.  ,3,19
"MULDER: You got any leads on this case, Detective? Any thoughts or ideas?  ",3,19
MULDER: You got anybody that can read or speak Chinese?  ,3,19
"MULDER: Will you get him? I want to see if he can, uh, read this for me.  ",3,19
MULDER: Hi.  ,3,19
MULDER: There's something written up here on the ceiling. I was wondering if you could read it.  ,3,19
MULDER: Ghost?  ,3,19
"MULDER: I don't know, but it's something strange for a man being burned alive to write, don't you think?  ",3,19
MULDER: What's this? Does anybody recognize this? Looks like some kind of foreign currency.  ,3,19
MULDER: Is it worth anything?  ,3,19
MULDER: Where would I get this  Hell Money?  ,3,19
MULDER: That's good. Maybe we just found a way to identify the body.  ,3,19
MULDER: How many dishes do you have to break before your boss tosses you in an oven?  ,3,19
"MULDER: Why would he write the character for ""ghost"" on the inside of the crematory oven?  ",3,19
MULDER: What about the guard seeing three figures that seemed to vanish without a trace?  ,3,19
MULDER: Who you gonna call? Ghosts or ancestral spirits have been central to Chinese spiritual life for centuries.  ,3,19
"MULDER: Well that would sure teach him to respect his elders, wouldnt it?  ",3,19
MULDER: What does it say?  ,3,19
MULDER: Can you copy it down for me?  ,3,19
MULDER: (walking into the apartment) Talk about tacky.  ,3,19
MULDER: What's that smell?  ,3,19
MULDER: (pulling up a corner of the carpet) Looks like they saved some money on carpet tacks and didnt even bother to replace any of the old padding.  ,3,19
MULDER: (still looking under carpet) Looks like Mr. Lo could have used a little of both.  ,3,19
MULDER: Lets get this blood tested.  ,3,19
MULDER: What had the victim been using?  ,3,19
MULDER: Ask her if she knows hes dead.  ,3,19
MULDER: Ask her if she recognizes those characters that were painted on his door.  ,3,19
MULDER: Haunted? You mean by ghosts?  ,3,19
MULDER: You think these murders could be related?  ,3,19
MULDER: Is this a newly dug plot?  ,3,19
MULDER: Chinese?  ,3,19
MULDER: Something just occurred to me. (pushes dirt aside exposing the dead face of LI DI-HUAN) Looks like somebody was trying to get two burials for the price of one.  ,3,19
MULDER: What did you find?  ,3,19
MULDER: What was wrong with him?  ,3,19
MULDER: Nothing? What do you mean?  ,3,19
MULDER: Depends on the body. (SCULLY gives VERY small smile) I don't know. A few bucks. How much?  ,3,19
MULDER: You're saying that this guy was selling his body parts for money?  ,3,19
MULDER: He won't be cashing any social security checks any time soon.  ,3,19
"MULDER: Scully, even if you're right, it doesn't figure. There's no long-term business sense to dying. What connection does this have to the crematory deaths?  ",3,19
"MULDER: (still eating seeds) Well, were gonna need more help from you than that, Detective.  ",3,19
MULDER: No.  ,3,19
MULDER: What's this?  ,3,19
"MULDER: How long have you lived in this country, Mr. Hsin?  ",3,19
MULDER: You live here alone?  ,3,19
"MULDER: Thank you, Mr. Hsin. If we need you, we'll get back to you. Okay? Thank you.  ",3,19
MULDER: (watching the two men) Ill tell you in a minute.  ,3,19
MULDER: What was that about?  ,3,19
MULDER: (showing CHAO the tile he picked up) You know what this is?  ,3,19
MULDER: Do you know what it says?  ,3,19
MULDER: Wood?  ,3,19
MULDER: Hes missing his eye and Id like to know how he lost it.  ,3,19
"MULDER: I doubt theyre to the ophthalmologist, though.  ",3,19
"MULDER: (smiles) No, Im just a little tired, jumpy. One more string of firecrackers goes off, Im going to get out of the car and shoot somebody.  ",3,19
"MULDER: No, but Im glad youre here cause I was just about to go and ask Mr. Hsin if I could use his bathroom.  ",3,19
MULDER: What do you mean?  ,3,19
MULDER: Who cut him?  ,3,19
MULDER: Did anybody see him get up?  ,3,19
MULDER: Can I see his chart?  ,3,19
MULDER: Yeah.  ,3,19
MULDER: I want to see what his blood type was.  ,3,19
MULDER: Why would he run?  ,3,19
MULDER: Maybe all this heel dragging's a diversion. That ghost story's a ruse. What was the hemotype of the blood we found on the carpet padding? (LIEUTENANT NEARY hands him the chart) Thank you.  ,3,19
"MULDER: Glen Chao, O-negative. Well, that's a coincidence.  ",3,19
MULDER: And Id be willing to bet that he's the one who asked for it to be installed.  ,3,19
MULDER: Yeah. That conversation they had wasn't about any firetrap.  ,3,19
"MULDER: What's your father involved in, Kim?  ",3,19
MULDER: Who are these men that come to visit your father?  ,3,19
MULDER: (showing her the tile) Do you know what this is?  ,3,19
MULDER: Do you know what it says? I found it  over there by the TV before.  ,3,19
MULDER: (realizing) Theyre playing some kind of game.  ,3,19
MULDER: What?  ,3,19
MULDER: Do you have a name or a phone number for this doctor?  ,3,19
"MULDER: 311 Porter, right.  ",3,19
"MULDER: Hey Scully, look whos here. This must be the place, after all.  ",3,19
MULDER: Its definitely not Chinese food Im smelling.  ,3,19
MULDER: It smells like rubbing alcohol.  ,3,19
MULDER: Whats this?  ,3,19
MULDER: It sounds like its coming from upstairs.  ,3,19
MULDER: Chao? Hands in the air. Hands in the air!  ,3,19
MULDER: What did he say?  ,3,19
MULDER: (to SCULLY) Can I talk to you for a minute?  ,3,19
MULDER: I just got back from St. Francis Hospital. Hsin's still in intensive care.  ,3,19
MULDER: I checked with the donor procurement organization. Shes been put on the recipient list.  ,3,19
MULDER: Yeah.  ,3,19
MULDER: They put up a wall of silence. They all claim to be members of some social club. That they saw nothing.  ,3,19
"MULDER: He was supposed to testify before a grand jury this morning. When he didn't show, they went to his home. He's vanished. Like a ghost.  ",3,19
MULDER: You don't sound so sure of that.  ,3,20
MULDER: Would you be willing to take a lie detector test to prove that you raped her?  ,3,20
"MULDER: Well, that's too bad. Because the next rape you experience will probably be your own... in prison.  ",3,20
"MULDER: Are you having trouble sleeping? Are you experiencing muscle pains? Vision problems? Nose bleeds? When you look at a particular object, do you receive the sudden flash that you're actually looking at something else? An alien's face?  ",3,20
"MULDER: The description of the aliens, the physical exam, the mindscan, the presence of another human being that appears switched off, it's all characteristic of a typical abduction.  ",3,20
"MULDER: Yeah, if it were only one person, Scully, but we have two individuals here, each verifying the other's story.  ",3,20
MULDER: You still going to hold the boy?  ,3,20
MULDER: But the victim seems to confirm his alibi.  ,3,20
MULDER: How did the alien respond?  ,3,20
"MULDER: What was the other alien, the gray, what was it doing during all this.  ",3,20
MULDER: Telepathically?  ,3,20
MULDER: Because the other alien was conducting torturous experiments on you?  ,3,20
MULDER: Then what?  ,3,20
MULDER: He said it happened before the abduction. So what if they had sex?  ,3,20
MULDER: So you're saying that all this is just a case of sexual trauma?  ,3,20
MULDER: Why don't you tell us what happened that night?  ,3,20
MULDER: Why is that?  ,3,20
MULDER: What did these men look like?  ,3,20
MULDER: All in black?  ,3,20
"MULDER: Since the '50s, people who have had close encounters have reported subsequent visits by these unearthly men in black.  ",3,20
"MULDER: If we have any more questions, where can we find you?  ",3,20
"MULDER: "" I sat in my stalled truck, frozen in terror, watching as this third alien attacked the other two gray aliens. And then it happened, the thing that forever changed my life...  ",3,20
"MULDER: ""...thee. Before I knew it, I was aboard the hover vessel and was not heading into outer space, but inner space, heading towards the earth's molten core. For that is the domain of the third alien, whose name, he soon told me... was Lord Kinbote.""  ",3,20
"MULDER: I'm not saying he isn't delusional, I'm just suggesting that his delusional state was triggered by something he actually witnessed that night. And the first part of his story verifies the boy's version. In fact, the only version that doesn't add up is the girl's.  ",3,20
MULDER: I'm going to arrange to have her re-hypnotized.  ,3,20
MULDER: To see if what she remembers is really what she remembers.  ,3,20
MULDER: Air Force?  ,3,20
"MULDER: No, I think you're wrong about that, Scully. But I do think you're right about one thing, that this case might not have anything to do with aliens.  ",3,20
MULDER: Hey! Does that video camera work?  ,3,20
"MULDER: I don't know, but I bet we can find his I.D. from the, uh, military database.  ",3,20
MULDER: That was fast.  ,3,20
MULDER: Who notified you?  ,3,20
MULDER: Possible kidnapping.  ,3,20
"MULDER: No, no, no, but you can talk to the other AWOL pilot that was brought in with him.  ",3,20
"MULDER: That's right. Yeah, he's, he's, he's right down...  ",3,20
MULDER: I got to find that video guy.  ,3,20
MULDER: Where's the tape?  ,3,20
MULDER: Who?  ,3,20
"MULDER: If I find out you lied to me, you're a dead man.  ",3,20
MULDER: Lieutenant Jack Schaffer?  ,3,20
MULDER: Or on visitors from outer space?  ,3,20
"MULDER: They experience ""missing time.""  ",3,20
MULDER: But abductions?  ,3,20
MULDER: But what do you do with the abductees?  ,3,20
MULDER: Hypnosis.  ,3,20
"MULDER: But if abductions are just a covert intelligence operation and UFOs are merely secret military airships, piloted by aliens such as yourself... then what were you abducted by?  ",3,20
MULDER: What do you mean?  ,3,20
MULDER: I can only assure you that I do.  ,3,20
"MULDER: Wait a minute, wait a minute. It can't all be fake memory implantations. What about that third alien? What, what was that thing?  ",3,20
MULDER: Sweet potato pie.  ,3,20
MULDER: You ever seen a UFO in these parts?  ,3,20
"MULDER: You ever experienced a period of ""missing time?""  ",3,20
MULDER: Scully?  ,3,20
MULDER: Where is she?!  ,3,20
"MULDER: Similar things are said about the men in black. That they purposely dress and behave strangely so that if anyone tries to describe an encounter with them, they come off sounding like a lunatic.  ",3,20
"MULDER: I told you, you didn't let me in. They were already here.  ",3,20
MULDER: They don't want assistance. They want witnesses to their alibi.  ,3,20
MULDER: Thanks.  ,3,20
MULDER: Don't write this book.  ,3,20
MULDER: What's that?  ,3,20
MULDER: How the hell should I know?  ,3,20
MULDER: I'm looking for Detective Waltos?  ,3,21
MULDER: My name is Mulder. I work with Assistant Director Skinner. I'd like to speak with him.  ,3,21
MULDER: Why don't you just get a statement here?  ,3,21
MULDER: (to phone) Yeah.  ,3,21
"MULDER: Yeah, it appears to be a little more complicated than that. It seems like he had a front-row seat.  ",3,21
MULDER: I don't understand it either. They're not letting me talk to him. Hold on a second.  ,3,21
"MULDER: (to Skinner) Excuse me, sir?  ",3,21
MULDER: Detective? Detective? Detective? (Waltos finally stops) Can you at least tell me what happened? What does he say happened?  ,3,21
MULDER: You don't believe him?  ,3,21
MULDER: What about the victim? Has she been identified?  ,3,21
"MULDER: Well, there must be evidence of an intruder of some kind.  ",3,21
"MULDER: Well, then, if you know the drill, then you should be canvassing hotel employees, housekeeping ...  ",3,21
"MULDER: Detective? (hands him his card) When you're done questioning him, I'd appreciate a call.  ",3,21
MULDER: Get any of that?  ,3,21
"MULDER: No, no, I want you to take a look at that body. Get down to the coroner's. I'll meet you there.  ",3,21
MULDER: Beyond what?  ,3,21
MULDER: Were Skinner's the only prints lifted from the body?  ,3,21
MULDER: At least they were having safe sex.  ,3,21
MULDER: Yeah. Her name was Carina Sayles. She was a legal secretary for one of the criminal defense firms here in town.  ,3,21
"MULDER: Yeah, I just got off the phone with one of the partners. She was fired a few weeks ago over an indiscretion.  ",3,21
"MULDER: Yeah, she was doing some moonlighting. She was taking a little work on the side for one of the firm's clients.  ",3,21
MULDER: This client operated an escort service. She was a prostitute.  ,3,21
MULDER: I'll get the car.  ,3,21
MULDER: (flashing his badge) Lorraine Kelleher?  ,3,21
"MULDER: Busy or not, we need to speak with her.  ",3,21
"MULDER: I think you mean ""banging.""  ",3,21
"MULDER: Oh, that's all right. I don't think she's gonna be making that meeting.  ",3,21
MULDER: She's dead. She was murdered last night.  ,3,21
MULDER: That's what we're still trying to determine.  ,3,21
"MULDER: I guess that would hurt future book sales, huh?  ",3,21
"MULDER: No, I don't think I would be.  ",3,21
"MULDER: Look, we just need one name from you. Who hired Carina Sayles?  ",3,21
MULDER: (sharply) Cut the crap. Who hired her?  ,3,21
MULDER: Then you have his name.  ,3,21
MULDER: Thank you.  ,3,21
MULDER: What the hell was he thinking?  ,3,21
MULDER: You'd think he'd be a little more discrete.  ,3,21
"MULDER: Still, not enough to prove anything conclusively.  ",3,21
MULDER: You really believe Skinner did this?  ,3,21
MULDER: Credit card fraud happens every day.  ,3,21
MULDER: We know that he's put his ass on the line for us a number of times. We owe it to him to find out what really happened.  ,3,21
"MULDER: (to phone) Yeah, Mulder. Thank you. (hangs up)  ",3,21
MULDER: Detective Waltos. Skinner's been released on his own recognizance.  ,3,21
MULDER: Sir? Sir?  ,3,21
MULDER: Of course it concerns us.  ,3,21
MULDER: Does it explain why you refused to take a polygraph test? Or why there's a prostitute in the morgue with your fingerprints all over her?  ,3,21
MULDER: Ask me what?  ,3,21
MULDER: No. I don't think he did it.  ,3,21
MULDER: Yeah.  ,3,21
"MULDER: Well, I don't know what you do down in Norfolk, but last time I checked, rifling through a man's office was considered an invasion of privacy.  ",3,21
MULDER: What do you mean?  ,3,21
MULDER: What case? He hasn't even been charged yet.  ,3,21
MULDER: For what? In case we might turn up any evidence that might support his innocence?  ,3,21
MULDER: Skinner's not answering his phone.  ,3,21
MULDER: Yeah. Why? He knows better than that. The evidence is still circumstantial at best.  ,3,21
"MULDER: The man's marriage is breaking up. He's stressed out, you know, he's ...  ",3,21
MULDER: (shaking his head) Please. Give him the benefit of the doubt.  ,3,21
"MULDER: When I mentioned that hooker to him, he didn't even seem to know.  ",3,21
MULDER: What do you mean? Either he remembers or he's a liar.  ,3,21
MULDER: Night terrors?  ,3,21
"MULDER: It's fascinating, but what does it have to do with Skinner?  ",3,21
MULDER: For running away from trains?  ,3,21
MULDER: So you think that Skinner may have killed the victim in his sleep?  ,3,21
MULDER: And it's not such a strange story.  ,3,21
"MULDER: It's ancient, actually. You may have heard it, although not in such clinical terms. In the middle ages, a visitation like the one Skinner described would have been attributed to a succubus. It's a spirit that visits men in the night, usually in the form of an old woman.  ",3,21
MULDER: Usually. Though sometimes the succubus becomes so attached to the man that she would kill any woman competing for his affection. Here.  ,3,21
"MULDER: Reports of residual luminous phenomena have been associated with some succubus encounters, at least according to the mythology. Why?  ",3,21
MULDER: This phosphorescence required no UV or infrared light?  ,3,21
MULDER: Did you get a sample?  ,3,21
MULDER: And?  ,3,21
MULDER: What'd they say?  ,3,21
MULDER: Are you sure you saw something?  ,3,21
MULDER: (pushing the shelf back in) Maybe that's it. Maybe that's why Skinner's running. He's afraid.  ,3,21
MULDER: That he doesn't know he didn't do it.  ,3,21
MULDER: The C.T. scan showed a subdural hematoma. She's in surgery right now to relieve pressure on her brain. Scully's trying to get more information.  ,3,21
"MULDER: You can't do that, sir.  ",3,21
MULDER: Not yet. But they're building a pretty convincing case.  ,3,21
"MULDER: No, I don't, but I'm in the minority.  ",3,21
MULDER: Scully ... (clears his throat) Scully doesn't understand why you're not trying to defend yourself.  ,3,21
"MULDER: What about the old woman in your dream. Who is she? It's gonna come out. (Skinner doesn't respond) Look, if you don't start trusting someone, you don't stand a chance.  ",3,21
MULDER: Again?  ,3,21
"MULDER: Yeah, you were the sole survivor. You also described what sounded like a near-death experience.  ",3,21
MULDER: That's when you first saw her?  ,3,21
MULDER: And why not?  ,3,21
MULDER: (nodding) So you just dismissed her as another hallucination?  ,3,21
MULDER: But you couldn't?  ,3,21
"MULDER: Well, maybe she was trying to protect you. Maybe she's trying to protect you now.  ",3,21
MULDER: That's a question only you can answer.  ,3,21
MULDER: This is Skinner's car?  ,3,21
MULDER: Woltos' people finish going over the interior?  ,3,21
MULDER: Can I borrow your flashlight?  ,3,21
MULDER: I'll meet you there.  ,3,21
MULDER: Collecting evidence.  ,3,21
"MULDER: Your car hits something, a bag fills with air and you don't die.  ",3,21
MULDER: It doesn't look like a face.  ,3,21
MULDER: How long does that fine-tuning take?  ,3,21
MULDER: I'm not the only one who needs it.  ,3,21
MULDER: (on phone) Hello.  ,3,21
MULDER: Hello.  ,3,21
"MULDER: What happened, where's Skinner?  ",3,21
MULDER: They dismissed him?  ,3,21
"MULDER: And they used us to do it, didn't they? They used the X-Files.  ",3,21
"MULDER: Because I think Skinner's been out-maneuvered, Scully. They found a weakness and they're exploiting it.  ",3,21
MULDER: To put us in check. You remove Skinner and you weaken us.  ,3,21
MULDER: This is the man that stole Skinner's car last night and tried to kill his wife.  ,3,21
"MULDER: Well, they already tried that once, and a second attempt would be too obvious, even for these thugs. Anyway, I think Skinner's probably worth more to them alive in disgrace than dead and buried.  ",3,21
MULDER: I don't know. Danny couldn't find anything on him. He's still running it.  ,3,21
"MULDER: Well, this guy's a pawn. Pawns always make the first move.  ",3,21
MULDER: (to a policeman) What happened here?  ,3,21
MULDER: He got to her first.  ,3,21
MULDER: Is this the man who hired Carina?  ,3,21
MULDER: He lied. Skinner's not the only person he set up.  ,3,21
MULDER: I need you to arrange a meeting.  ,3,21
"MULDER: Unfortunately, Lorraine can't get to the phone right now.  ",3,21
MULDER: Look what he did to your friends. We're your only chance of coming out of this OK.  ,3,21
MULDER: I want you to call him. Tell him you're scared because we questioned you. Tell him you want money to get out of town. (hands her his cell phone) You'll meet him at the Ambassodor Hotel bar. OK?  ,3,21
"MULDER: No, he hasn't shown up yet.  ",3,21
MULDER: This guy isn't about to let a little rain stop him.  ,3,21
"MULDER: Scully, what's going on?  ",3,21
MULDER: He's upstairs.  ,3,21
MULDER: You OK?  ,3,21
"MULDER: Yeah, there's something else you'll find missing in there. (Scully stops at the door) An explanation for how you knew to be at the hotel last night. I was hoping you could fill in that line item yourself.  ",3,21
MULDER: Why not?  ,3,21
MULDER: Then why don't you tell me? Off the record.  ,3,21
MULDER: Did you really have to bring that thing?  ,3,22
MULDER: I think I'm lost anyway. I've got to stop and ask for directions.  ,3,22
MULDER: Dr Bailey works for the US Forestry Service. That makes his disappearance a federal case.  ,3,22
"MULDER: Dr Bailey's not the first person to go missing from Heuvelman's Lake recently. Two weeks ago, a Boy Scout Troop was out here, fox hunting, their troop leader wandered off to relieve himself, and hasn't been seen or heard from since.  ",3,22
MULDER: The operative word being large.  ,3,22
MULDER: What makes you think I'm leaving anything out?  ,3,22
"MULDER: Dr Farraday, you know the wildlife living around this lake just as well as anybody, don't you?  ",3,22
MULDER: Are you aware of any indigenous species that's capable of attacking a human being?  ,3,22
"MULDER: Aside from that, is there a creature that comes to mind...  ",3,22
MULDER: Okay then. In your work have you come across any evidence that lends support to the existance of this creature they call Big Blue?  ,3,22
MULDER: What?  ,3,22
MULDER: I'll take that rambling diatribe to mean that you don't believe in the existance of such a creature.  ,3,22
MULDER: A prehistoric animal living in a lake is not without presidence. Last August they pulled a Bull shark from Lake Onaga in Massasteuchusts.  ,3,22
"MULDER: It's been reported for centuries in dozens of countries. From the monsters in Loch Ness, Nessie, to the Ogopogo in Lake Okonagan.  ",3,22
MULDER: Sounds like you know a little something about the subject.  ,3,22
"MULDER: Well some very grown up crypto-zoologist believed it could be an evolutionary throwback, quite possibly prehistoric.  ",3,22
"MULDER: A pleosaur, acutualluy. Though admittedly, there's not a lot of hard evidence to back that up.  ",3,22
MULDER: Well how many folk tales do you know that could eat a boy scout leader and a biologist?  ,3,22
"MULDER: Check this out, Scully.  ",3,22
MULDER: We're looking for the Lake View Cabins. Flipper Road?  ,3,22
MULDER: Fine. (He grabs it.)  ,3,22
MULDER: What are they saying?  ,3,22
MULDER: About Big Blue? What kind of stories?  ,3,22
MULDER: What about you? Do you believe those stories?  ,3,22
MULDER: So you think Big Blue's responsible for what's been happening?  ,3,22
MULDER: Have you ever actually seen it?  ,3,22
MULDER: It's Scout Woolsley. The boy scout troop leader.  ,3,22
MULDER: Are you insinuating something?  ,3,22
MULDER: Still doesn't explain why half of him is still missing. Looks to me like something took a big bite.  ,3,22
MULDER: What do you mean?  ,3,22
MULDER: But are fish also known for eating half and saving half for later?  ,3,22
MULDER: (Picks it up. It says: 'Show Us Your Bobbers') How could you not?  ,3,22
"MULDER: Careful, watch out where you're walking. Watch out...watch out for those tracks.  ",3,22
MULDER: Any sign of Ted Bertram?  ,3,22
MULDER: Just until we figure out what's going on here.  ,3,22
"MULDER: But you've got two or three in as many weeks, I'd say you're a little outside your bell curve, Sheriff.  ",3,22
MULDER: What about these tracks?  ,3,22
MULDER: That's what it looks like.  ,3,22
"MULDER: Yeah, but what happened to the hoaxer? (He swipes a finger around the boot, then holds it up to reveal blood.)  ",3,22
"MULDER: Well, if this is a hoax, it's quite elaborate. (He looks at the head, encased in a plastic bag.)  ",3,22
"MULDER: Twenty feet from shore, and twice in one day?  ",3,22
MULDER: What about Ted Bertram?  ,3,22
"MULDER: Oh, is that the psychological approach to crime solving? He's too embarrased?  ",3,22
"MULDER: This roll's been exposed, can you get that developed? (Hands a camera to a deputy.) That's three in one day, Sheriff. All this driving from crime scene to crime scene's giving me highway hypnosis. Close down the lake.  ",3,22
"MULDER: Look at this, could this be a tooth?  ",3,22
"MULDER: There's thousands of pictures here, Scully. There's got to be some evidence here somewhere. Take a look at these.  ",3,22
MULDER: That could be something.  ,3,22
MULDER: Want me to come with you?  ,3,22
"MULDER: Goodnight, I'll see you in the morning.  ",3,22
"MULDER: I'm sorry about Queequeg. You know, I think I've learned something from these photos.  ",3,22
"MULDER: (Goes over to her, and points out sighting locations on a map.) They're not pictures of the lake monster, they're pictures of the lake. Locations where the fish has been sighted over the past several years. Look, five years ago, all the sightings occured in the centre of the lake. But progressively the sightings have moved closer and closer to shore, until this year, they're practically on the shore.  ",3,22
MULDER: Which part?  ,3,22
MULDER: Can you drive a boat?  ,3,22
MULDER: We are fishing.  ,3,22
MULDER: You want to head right...here. (Points at the map.)  ,3,22
"MULDER: I know the difference between expectation and hope. Seek and ye shall find, Scully.  ",3,22
MULDER: I got a map of New York City just like that.  ,3,22
MULDER: It ain't low gas.  ,3,22
"MULDER: Here be monsters, Scully.  ",3,22
"MULDER: Yep, that's what it looks like. (A huge crash is heard, then water pours in through a hole in the boat's stern.)  ",3,22
MULDER: I say we swim to shore.  ,3,22
"MULDER: Yeah, the shore can't be too far from here.  ",3,22
MULDER: When you're living in the city you forget that night is actually so...dark.  ,3,22
"MULDER: That was him Scully, that was Big Blue.  ",3,22
"MULDER: What do you mean, what are we doing here?  ",3,22
"MULDER: Scully, some of the things that we investigate are so intangible but this creature it exists within the specific earthly confines of this lake, and I want to find it.  ",3,22
"MULDER: You're a scientist, why do you ask that question? I mean, it would be a marvelous discovery, it could revolutionize our evolutionary biological thinking.  ",3,22
MULDER: A tooth?  ,3,22
MULDER: I heard him joke that he was hoping to live off the copyrights fees of a genuine Big Blue photo.  ,3,22
MULDER: You don't think my reasons are legitimate?  ,3,22
"MULDER: I'm still tempted to fire. Hey Scully, you think you could ever cannibalize someone? I mean if you really had to.  ",3,22
MULDER: You've lost some weight recently haven't you?  ,3,22
"MULDER: Though it is amazing what some animals will do to guarantee the continuation of a species isn't it? A creature of this size must have adapted its behavior over the years to minimize its chances of being seen by its only predator, us. Its coming closer to shore must have been an act of desperation on its part.  ",3,22
MULDER: Why did you name your dog Queequeg?  ,3,22
"MULDER: It's a bizarre name for a dog, huh?  ",3,22
"MULDER: Scully, are you coming on to me?  ",3,22
"MULDER: You know, its interesting you should say that, because I've always wanted a peg leg. It's a boyhood thing I never grew out of. I'm not being flippant, I've given this a lot of thought. I mean. if you have a peg leg or hooks for hands then maybe its enough to simply keep on living. You know, braving facing life with your disability. But without these things you're actually meant to make something of your life, achieve something earn a raise, wear a necktie. So if anything I'm actually the antithesis of Ahab, because if I did have a peg leg I'd quite possibly be more happy and more content not to be chasing after these creatures of the unknown.  ",3,22
"MULDER: No, flippant is my favourite line from Moby Dick. 'Hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple dumpling', huh?  ",3,22
"MULDER: I don't know, but it ain't no duck. (The lamp goes out.)  ",3,22
MULDER: Actually it sank.  ,3,22
MULDER: What's in the sack?  ,3,22
MULDER: The frogs.  ,3,22
MULDER: The unexplained depletion of frogs originates from this cove. It's the food chain.  ,3,22
"MULDER: Food chain. If you alter one life form in an ecosystem, the rest is necessarily affected, either by an increase or decrease. So if an aquatic dinosaur's diet consisted primarily of frogs, then if those frogs suddenly became scarce, it would have to search for an alternative food source.  ",3,22
"MULDER: This creature lives here in this cove. That explains the disappearance of these frogs, for which you have no explanation, ludicrous or not. As well as the recent human attacks.  ",3,22
"MULDER: I'm talking about a prehistoric creature that's gone unnoticed for virtually thousands of years. If it knows how do anything, it knows how to hide. They say that the Loch Ness monster doesn't even live in the water, that it lives in the surrounding cliffs. Maybe Big Blue has an inland habitat, somewhere in the rocks, or in this dense forest here.  ",3,22
MULDER: Where'd this happen?  ,3,22
"MULDER: No, we need those men here, searching this cove and these woods.  ",3,22
MULDER: Sweep this cove. It's here in Striker's cove.  ,3,22
MULDER: (Turns to Scully.) Thanks.  ,3,22
"MULDER: Dr Farraday. (They run through the woods, and spot Farraday lying on the ground.) What happened?  ",3,22
MULDER: Did you see it?  ,3,22
MULDER: Where'd it go?  ,3,22
MULDER: How's Dr Farraday?  ,3,22
MULDER: I'm fine.  ,3,22
"MULDER: Yeah, but I still don't have that peg leg.  ",3,22
MULDER: I know. I guess I just wanted Big Blue to be real. I guess I see hope in such a possibility.  ,3,22
MULDER: Our blind date's not off to a good start. I've been waiting here nearly two hours.  ,3,23
"MULDER: It's just you, me, and the drug dealers.  ",3,23
MULDER: Especially when Congress is in session.  ,3,23
MULDER: Follow where?  ,3,23
"MULDER: What do you mean, that's all you have for me? I get an anonymous e-mail to come meet you here in the middle of the night, I don't know who you are or what you want.  ",3,23
MULDER: Then you're just a messenger boy?  ,3,23
MULDER: Who told you to contact me? How do I know I'm not being played?  ,3,23
"MULDER: Well, then you can go ahead and recycle that, then.  ",3,23
"MULDER: Multiple homicide, a bizarre one. That's Joseph Patnik. He murdered five people, all of whom he insists was the same man.  ",3,23
"MULDER: Well, he claims to have been killing the same man over and over again, that he wouldn't die.  ",3,23
"MULDER: Not that I know, but I only just got this case yesterday.  ",3,23
"MULDER: In Patnik's neighborhood two weeks ago, a baby-sitter attacked the two children she was minding. She told the police she thought they were wolves.  ",3,23
"MULDER: Not so far, no.  ",3,23
"MULDER: Doctor Stroman, this is my partner, Special Agent Scully.  ",3,23
MULDER: Have you?  ,3,23
MULDER: He seems pretty manageable to me.  ,3,23
MULDER: Who called you down on this case?  ,3,23
MULDER: Could we speak to him?  ,3,23
MULDER: Came from an outside source.  ,3,23
MULDER: I don't know.  ,3,23
"MULDER: We've got dead bodies and confessed murderers. If we're being used, it's to find out the connection. That's what I'm interested in.  ",3,23
MULDER: You got a pass to come in here and eat these people's food and watch their TV?  ,3,23
"MULDER: Well, maybe you should head back to school.  ",3,23
MULDER: Anything good?  ,3,23
MULDER: Between what he saw and what he recorded and what he did?  ,3,23
MULDER: I just watched thirty-six hours of Bernard Shaw and Bobbie Batista. I'm about ready to kill somebody too.  ,3,23
MULDER: What's on the tapes?  ,3,23
MULDER: The same guy that started Patnik screaming in the psych ward?  ,3,23
"MULDER: So you think that because Patnik saw this war criminal on television, he was somehow inspired to go out and murder these people?  ",3,23
"MULDER: Yeah, but those studies are based on the assumption that Americans are just empty vessels ready to be filled with any idea or image that's fed to them like a bunch of Pavlov dogs and go out and act on it.  ",3,23
"MULDER: They, studies have also shown causal connections between cow flatulence and the depletion of the ozone layer. What you're talking about is pseudo-science used to make political book.  ",3,23
MULDER: How?  ,3,23
"MULDER: All I know is television does not make a previously sane man go out and kill five people, thinking they're all the same guy. Not even ""Must-See TV"" could do that to you.  ",3,23
MULDER: I can't. Not yet.  ,3,23
MULDER: I'm going to get some sleep. Looks like you could use some too.  ,3,23
MULDER: You have fun.  ,3,23
MULDER: Scully?  ,3,23
MULDER: I just got a call. There's been another murder.  ,3,23
"MULDER: It happened just less than an hour ago. It seems to match our pattern, a housewife gone berserk.  ",3,23
"MULDER: No. Uh, I went out, and I got a paper this morning. Why?  ",3,23
"MULDER: Okay, thanks, Detective.  ",3,23
MULDER: She looked out the window and claims she saw her husband in the hammock... with a blonde.  ,3,23
"MULDER: Yeah, apparently, he was only taking a nap with his dog...  ",3,23
"MULDER: This is not even her husband. Her husband's a long-haul trucker. He's been out of town for the last ten days. Mister John Gillness, it's her next-door neighbor. She didn't even have the right backyard. Helene Riddock lives over here.  ",3,23
"MULDER: ""A thing of beauty is a joy forever..."" what do you think, Scully?  ",3,23
"MULDER: As it does in almost every American home, but television does not equal violence. I don't care what anybody says...  ",3,23
MULDER: Hang on a second.  ,3,23
MULDER: I'm coming down.  ,3,23
MULDER: I found a cable trapper scrambler running from the pole into the house.  ,3,23
"MULDER: Yeah, I'll do it.  ",3,23
MULDER: Stay in touch.  ,3,23
MULDER: What does this one block?  ,3,23
MULDER: Then what does it do?  ,3,23
"MULDER: I bet all you guys were officers in the audio-visual club in high school, huh?  ",3,23
MULDER: Looks the same.  ,3,23
MULDER: Still looks the same.  ,3,23
MULDER: So they're different.  ,3,23
"MULDER: Yeah, you click it on, you have a picture.  ",3,23
MULDER: What kind of information?  ,3,23
"MULDER: Well, can you take it apart?  ",3,23
MULDER: This device is emitting a signal.  ,3,23
MULDER: Mulder.  ,3,23
MULDER: I was just about to call you.  ,3,23
MULDER: I think they may be running some kind of test.  ,3,23
MULDER: Yeah.  ,3,23
MULDER: I didn't take it over to Pendrell.  ,3,23
"MULDER: Look, I'd, I'd rather talk about it when we get on the land line, okay? We've dealt with these kind of people before. We know what they're capable of.  ",3,23
MULDER: What was what?  ,3,23
"MULDER: Scully, is there something wrong?  ",3,23
"MULDER: Scully, look, I'm going to be right there, okay? Don't go anywhere. Don't...  ",3,23
"MULDER: Here, she's in here. Ready?  ",3,23
MULDER: Wait...  ,3,23
"MULDER: Mrs. Scully, hi, it's Fox Mulder.  ",3,23
MULDER: I was hoping that you'd heard from Dana.  ,3,23
MULDER: I'm... I'm not exactly sure.  ,3,23
"MULDER: Well, she ran off last night. Um... we, we, we're looking for her as best we can...  ",3,23
"MULDER: Look, Mrs. Scully, I hate to do this to you, but I got to hang up on you right now.  ",3,23
MULDER: Hang by the phone. I will call you as soon as I know something.  ,3,23
"MULDER: I appreciate that, but these officers should be instructed not to confront her once they find her.  ",3,23
MULDER: Just to keep an eye on her till I can get there. I think I can get her to listen to me.  ,3,23
MULDER: That's because she's not responsible for her own actions. She's suffering from some kind of paranoid psychosis.  ,3,23
"MULDER: I can't explain the exact mechanism, but it has something to do with certain videotapes we watched that we recovered from a crime scene.  ",3,23
MULDER: Videotapes that contain an electronic signal that somehow induces violent behavior.  ,3,23
MULDER: I'm working on that.  ,3,23
MULDER: Mulder.  ,3,23
MULDER: What is it?  ,3,23
MULDER: What am I looking at?  ,3,23
"MULDER: Bring it home, boys.  ",3,23
MULDER: Mind control?  ,3,23
MULDER: The naked lady in the ice cube.  ,3,23
MULDER: Why wasn't I affected?  ,3,23
"MULDER: This, uh... subliminal signal, could color be a factor in it?  ",3,23
MULDER: I'm red-green color blind.  ,3,23
MULDER: Mulder.  ,3,23
MULDER: I'll be right there.  ,3,23
MULDER: Maryland State Police. They think they've found Scully.  ,3,23
"MULDER: No, um... they think maybe I should come down and I.D. the body.  ",3,23
MULDER: I can't talk to you right now.  ,3,23
MULDER: That's an interesting choice of words. My partner may be dead.  ,3,23
MULDER: The hell it isn't! We're here because of you!  ,3,23
"MULDER: Who are you, who do you work for?  ",3,23
MULDER: Who?  ,3,23
MULDER: Let me do that.  ,3,23
MULDER: She's not answering her phone?  ,3,23
"MULDER: Mrs. Scully, is she here?  ",3,23
MULDER: You haven't been answering your phone.  ,3,23
MULDER: I need to see her.  ,3,23
MULDER: Sorry.  ,3,23
"MULDER: I'm here to help you, Scully.  ",3,23
"MULDER: I'm on your side, you know that.  ",3,23
"MULDER: Scully, listen to me very carefully. You don't know it, but you're sick with the same thing that drove those other people to murder... and whatever you think may be happening...  ",3,23
"MULDER: Scully, you are the only one I trust.  ",3,23
MULDER: How you feeling?  ,3,23
MULDER: Now you know how I feel most of the time.  ,3,23
MULDER: I'm not surprised.  ,3,23
"MULDER: Helen Riddock was scared her husband was going to be unfaithful to her. You see a pattern developing here? What if this, this video signal somehow turned these people's anxieties into some kind of dementia? Yeah, a, a virtual reality of their own worst nightmares?  ",3,23
MULDER: What do you mean?  ,3,23
"MULDER: Ah, maybe not.  ",3,23
"MULDER: Well, somebody's behind this, we just don't know who.  ",3,23
MULDER: I don't know.  ,3,23
"MULDER: What, uh, course of treatment have you outlined for Agent Scully?  ",3,23
MULDER: That didn't seem to be the case last night.  ,3,23
MULDER: You think that would account for her strange behavior?  ,3,23
"MULDER: Doctor Lorenz, uh...  ",3,23
MULDER: Thank you.  ,3,23
"MULDER: Yeah, this is Fox Mulder with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I need to talk to Doctor Stroman, please.  ",3,23
MULDER: You know where I can reach him?  ,3,23
MULDER: Is it 555-0135?  ,3,23
MULDER: Thank you.  ,3,23
MULDER: You want me to go first this time?  ,3,23
MULDER: You charge for local calls?  ,3,23
MULDER: You'd have a record of all calls made...  ,3,23
MULDER: Thanks.  ,3,23
MULDER: Now that you've destroyed all the evidence.  ,3,23
MULDER: I just didn't know I was working for you.  ,3,23
MULDER: Why kill them if you wanted me to expose them?  ,3,23
"MULDER: And uncover what? What were they trying to do, manipulate people's behavior? Alter their decision making-process? What to buy, who to vote for?  ",3,23
MULDER: Where will they stop?  ,3,23
"MULDER: Don't lay this off on me, you sneaky son of a bitch. You pulled me into this situation because you didn't have the courage to reveal the truth yourself.  ",3,23
"MULDER: You're a coward! You work in the shadows, you feed me scraps of information, hoping that I can piece it together. You make me risk my life, you risk my partner's life and you never risk your own!  ",3,23
"MULDER: Yes, sir.  ",3,23
"MULDER: No, sir.  ",3,23
MULDER: He remains an unknown subject.  ,3,23
MULDER: You're the 1st medic on the scene?  ,3,24
MULDER: Can you tell me what happened?  ,3,24
"MULDER: My name is Fox Mulder, I'm an FBI Agent. I understand you've been read your rights will you talk to me Mr Muntz? Can you tell me what happened?  ",3,24
MULDER: How do you mean?  ,3,24
MULDER: Talked to him?  ,3,24
"MULDER: The shooter described a man, a man who reached down and healed with the palm of his hand.  ",3,24
MULDER: They let him leave the scene?  ,3,24
MULDER: He's vanished?  ,3,24
MULDER: All the cars in the parking lot have been accounted for?  ,3,24
MULDER: Mulder.  ,3,24
MULDER: Yeah.  ,3,24
MULDER: What is it?  ,3,24
MULDER: Quonochautaug? I'm on my way.  ,3,24
MULDER: She's cold.    [pulls a blanket and puts it over her]  ,3,24
MULDER: Mom..  ,3,24
MULDER: How did she get here?  ,3,24
"MULDER: Mom.  [she wakes up] Hi. It's ok, everything's gonna be ok. [she makes a gesture like she wants to write] What what is it? What do you want?  ",3,24
MULDER: Palm?  [Mulder's mom is loaded up in an ambulance that leaves the hospital]  ,3,24
MULDER: Thanks.  ,3,24
MULDER: Yeah. I'm.. I just can't help thinking there's a correlation.  ,3,24
MULDER: A connection to the shooting at the fast food restaurant.  ,3,24
"MULDER: My mother wrote the word palm, that's what the man who healed the victim, that's what he used, the palm of his hand. [Scully gives a look]You..you think it's a leap?  ",3,24
MULDER: Why the word palm?  ,3,24
"MULDER: But you can't explain it exactly, nor can it be explained how the wounded were miraculously healed or how the man who healed them just vanished into the air, can it?  ",3,24
MULDER: I'm gonna go back to D.C..  ,3,24
MULDER: I wanna find out who this miracle man is.  ,3,24
MULDER: This is everything shot by the 1st news crews at the scene. [slips a tape into a VCR] Outtakes and unedited footage.  ,3,24
"MULDER: Yes it's supposed to be about 8:22 [shot at the VCR counter, fast forwarding] [Mulder hit the PLAY button]   [video footage playing] There, that must be him. [Smith, questioned by the Detective] [a person passes in front of the camera, and Smith isn't there anymore after, instead of him, another guy wearing the same suit, the Detective looks up and realizes Smith isn't there anymore]  ",3,24
MULDER: Hey he's gone.Where did he go? [hits the REV button and plays it again] You see that?  ,3,24
"MULDER: Looks like he's gone but there's..somebody else in his place, wearing the same clothes.  ",3,24
MULDER: Why don't you find out ?   [hands the remote control to Scully]  ,3,24
"MULDER: If I told you, you'd never let me go.  ",3,24
MULDER: Call me if you find anything .   [leaves the room]  ,3,24
MULDER: What?  ,3,24
MULDER: What are you talking about?  ,3,24
MULDER: Did you take this?  ,3,24
MULDER: I don't know. Did he hurt her?  ,3,24
MULDER: What did they argue about?  ,3,24
MULDER: You must have some idea or else you wouldn't have followed them here.  ,3,24
"MULDER: On the day my parents divorced, my mother vowed never to set foot in the summer house again, I know my mother, she kept her word.  ",3,24
MULDER: I have no idea what that could be.  ,3,24
MULDER: No.  ,3,24
"MULDER [to the secretary who stands up]: Hold his calls. [to Skinner] I want his name, I wanna know everything about him.  ",3,24
"MULDER: I want the smoking man smoked out, I want him exposed as the murdering son of a bitch that he is.  ",3,24
"MULDER: To our summer house, he was there with my mother. [shows them the pictures] He's the reason for what happened to her.  ",3,24
"MULDER: It *doesn't* matter where I got those, the only thing that matters is that *that* man is called to answer, now I want his name!  ",3,24
MULDER: You know how to get it.  ,3,24
MULDER: Well then you tell me how to find him.  ,3,24
MULDER: He knows about the man who disappeared from the restaurant shooting.  ,3,24
MULDER: He's trying to kill him.  ,3,24
MULDER: What?  ,3,24
MULDER: Where is he now?  ,3,24
MULDER: Mr Smith?  ,3,24
MULDER: I'm with the FBI. I'd like you to come with me  ,3,24
"MULDER: I'm sure you don't want to cause a scene at work, sir.  ",3,24
MULDER: We'll have plenty of time to talk sir.  ,3,24
MULDER: You see him?  ,3,24
MULDER: Will she regain consciousness?  ,3,24
MULDER: Thank you.  ,3,24
"MULDER: You wanna smoke that, or do you wanna smoke on this?  ",3,24
"MULDER: I should shoot you right here, but they probably would be able to save you.  ",3,24
MULDER: Or maybe shoot a bullet through your brain so you'd be bedridden on a bed for the rest of your life.  ,3,24
MULDER: What do you care?  ,3,24
MULDER: I don't care.  ,3,24
MULDER: And I know what you are looking for.  ,3,24
MULDER: Liar!  ,3,24
MULDER: Where is she? Where is she?  ,3,24
MULDER: I have what you want.  ,3,24
MULDER: Yes.  ,3,24
MULDER: I can't do that.  ,3,24
MULDER: And to you?  ,3,24
MULDER: Why?  ,3,24
"MULDER: It's a weapon, isn't it? Used to pierce the back of a neck. It's the only way we can kill them.  ",3,24
MULDER: Why do you want it ?  ,3,24
"MULDER: Let me get clear on something here, what we're talking about is colonization. The date is set, isn't it?  ",3,24
MULDER: No.   [walks away]  ,3,24
MULDER: You shoot me and you'll never find it.  ,3,24
"MULDER: I'm walking, away.  ",3,24
MULDER: Scully it's me.  ,3,24
"MULDER: I've been up with my mother, listen to me.  ",3,24
MULDER: Who?  ,3,24
"MULDER: Alright Scully, you gotta get out of your apartment, they're gonna be looking for him, I want you to meet me.  ",3,24
"MULDER: Off the I-95, uh Bond Mill Road.  ",3,24
"MULDER: Scully!  Scully move away from him, come stand behind me.  ",3,24
MULDER: How do I know you're for real?  ,3,24
MULDER: First I want you to come somewhere with me.  I want you to come with me to see my mother.  ,3,24
MULDER: How do I know you're for real?  ,4,1
MULDER: First I want you to come somewhere with me. I want you to come with me to see my mother.  ,4,1
"MULDER: Stay out of his way, Scully, he doesn't want to hurt you. You can't use your gun!  ",4,1
MULDER: Come on.  ,4,1
"MULDER: Scully, get the car!  ",4,1
MULDER: Hey! Jeremiah!  ,4,1
MULDER: You can't leave here!  ,4,1
MULDER: I need your help!  ,4,1
MULDER: Who?  ,4,1
"MULDER: What can they do? We're working in the light. They, they can't stop us without exposure, without consequence.  ",4,1
MULDER: The larger plan?  ,4,1
MULDER: I don't understand...  ,4,1
MULDER: My mother is dying. I need to take you to see her right now.  ,4,1
MULDER: How can I stop it?  ,4,1
"MULDER: No, look, there's no time!  ",4,1
"MULDER: Scully, it's me.  ",4,1
MULDER: Why?  ,4,1
"MULDER: Are you okay, Scully?  ",4,1
"MULDER: Listen to me, there's going to be... there's going to be people looking for me. They're going to think they can get to me through you.  ",4,1
"MULDER: No, no, no, hold on, just, just listen for a second, Scully. I need you to do something for me. I had to steal a car from an airport in Alberta.  ",4,1
MULDER: Who?  ,4,1
MULDER: How much further from here?  ,4,1
MULDER: Let's go.  ,4,1
MULDER: What happened to this man?  ,4,1
MULDER: There's a work order here. It's for yesterday. He's only been here a little more than twenty-four hours.  ,4,1
MULDER: What is it?  ,4,1
MULDER: Being grown for what?  ,4,1
MULDER: What is this? What's going on here?  ,4,1
MULDER: That looks just like my sister.  ,4,1
MULDER: What do you mean?  ,4,1
MULDER: What are you talking about?  ,4,1
MULDER: How'd they get here?  ,4,1
MULDER: Who takes care of them?  ,4,1
MULDER: They're clones.  ,4,1
MULDER: She's coming with us.  ,4,1
"MULDER: Well, then who is she?  ",4,1
"MULDER: Well, then explain it to me. Explain it to me now!  ",4,1
MULDER: Are bees what killed that man we found?  ,4,1
MULDER: It's probably not a good idea to hide in there.  ,4,1
MULDER: But you do?  ,4,1
MULDER: Come on!  ,4,1
"MULDER: Scully, where are you right now?  ",4,1
"MULDER: I'm still in Canada, but I'm catching a plane soon. I need you to meet me on the other end.  ",4,1
MULDER: At the hospital where my mother is.  ,4,1
MULDER: Her life depends upon me and my party getting there safely.  ,4,1
MULDER: Jeremiah Smith... and someone else.  ,4,1
MULDER: What do you mean?  ,4,1
MULDER: They'll get their chance.  ,4,1
"MULDER: Please, you can't kill him...he can't die.  ",4,1
MULDER: That girl is my sister.  ,4,1
"MULDER: Kill me, let them go.  ",4,1
MULDER: For my mother's.  ,4,1
MULDER: I can't... there's nothing.  ,4,1
MULDER: She'll never know.  ,4,1
"MULDER: I could have saved her, Scully.  ",4,1
MULDER: I had one chance... and I let it slip away.  ,4,1
MULDER: He took me to a place with green fields. And I saw my sister. She was just a little girl. I've seen too many things not to believe.  ,4,1
"MULDER: You put such faith in your science, Scully. But... the things I've seen, science provides no place to start.  ",4,1
MULDER: I feel like I came so close.  ,4,1
MULDER: How?  ,4,1
"MULDER: Hi, was he able to review the material that I sent him?  ",4,1
MULDER: And will he see me?  ,4,1
"MULDER: A friend. You know, I've been inquiring with each of the special representatives all month about the farmland in Canada. I've been trying to get some answers and all I've gotten are dead ends.  ",4,1
"MULDER: I've suffered... I've suffered some very personal... losses recently, and... I was... I was hoping...  ",4,1
"MULDER: What are your thoughts on that, Scully?  ",4,2
"MULDER: No, unfortunately. It's going on three days.  ",4,2
"MULDER: No, no hair and fiber evidence either. The rain washed it all away. The autopsy did come back on the dead boyfriend, though. It's a puncture wound through the left eardrum and into the brain, possibly from a long needle or awl.  ",4,2
MULDER: Don't you see the photo?  ,4,2
MULDER: It was taken by a sixty-five year old druggist moments before she was abducted. That's a passport photo from a local drugstore. The druggist who took that photo is the last known person to have seen Mary LeFante. Only he claims that wasn't the photo he was taking. He says the photo he was taking was normal in every respect. He only came forward to the police when he heard the woman was missing.  ,4,2
MULDER: That is what you would think.  ,4,2
MULDER: I'm sure you did it just fine.  ,4,2
MULDER: (smiling) So which one of us gets to use the stun gun on Bruno Hauptmann back there?  ,4,2
MULDER: So you think that would make it look like she posed screaming for a passport photo?  ,4,2
MULDER: Oh.  ,4,2
MULDER: I'm not sure I have a theory.  ,4,2
"MULDER: Yeah, agents Mulder and Scully.  ",4,2
MULDER: Inspector.  ,4,2
MULDER: Mary LeFante was intercepting them.  ,4,2
"MULDER: Yeah, but why would she stab her boyfriend through the ear? The magic was gone? Did you find a camera anywhere here?  ",4,2
MULDER: What would be the point of that?  ,4,2
"MULDER: Here it is. (He emerges with a Polaroid camera.) Stand back, Scully, it's loaded.  ",4,2
"MULDER: In the sixties, a bellhop named Ted Serios became kind of famous for taking what he called ""thoughtographs"". He claimed that by concentrating on an unexposed film negative, he could create a photographic representation of what he saw in his mind. He did landscapes, cathedrals, the Queen of England.  ",4,2
"MULDER: Also known as ""skotographs."" The literature on thought photography dates back almost to Louis Daguerre.  ",4,2
MULDER: Look at that.  ,4,2
"MULDER: I think he was here, Scully.  ",4,2
"MULDER: Mary LeFante's abductor. I think he stalked her. (He walks out an exterior door onto a porch, toward the steps onto the porch and then to a window on the wall near the closet.) He could have come up right here. I think he came in here and he looked at her through the window, this close. Close enough to affect the film in that camera.  ",4,2
"MULDER: Meant to conceal what? This isn't about mail fraud, Scully, that's just incidental. What if ... what if ... someone had this ability? An image like this would be a peak into that person's mind.  ",4,2
MULDER: The fantasy of a killer.  ,4,2
MULDER: The dental anesthetic.  ,4,2
MULDER: Would that account for her condition?  ,4,2
MULDER: What would?  ,4,2
MULDER: What is it?  ,4,2
MULDER: So we're looking for a doctor? Someone with training?  ,4,2
MULDER: (switching on the intercom) Mary?  ,4,2
MULDER: We better go in there and get her.  ,4,2
"MULDER: Charles Selchik, certified public accountant (he motions to an outline of a body marked on the floor) ... dead from a stab wound through the ear ... cleaning crew found the body.  ",4,2
"MULDER: His secretary, Alice Brandt, age 32. Her family confirmed that she was working late last night.  ",4,2
"MULDER: Apparently none, but if the M.O. remains the same ...  ",4,2
"MULDER: Yeah. I keep thinking about that word that Mary LeFante was repeating - ""unruhe."" I checked the Michigan phone directory. It appears under three different spellings but none within 80 miles of here.  ",4,2
"MULDER: That's what I've been thinking. Apparently in German, it means trouble or strife.  ",4,2
"MULDER: You took German in high school, Scully?  ",4,2
"MULDER: Unrest, huh?  ",4,2
"MULDER: He wasn't there, Scully.  ",4,2
"MULDER: It would have affected the photos. Trott, what did you find?  ",4,2
MULDER: That may be the only evidence we get.  ,4,2
"MULDER: What's here for them to find? This guy is obviously very good at what he does. He's left behind no witnesses, no latent prints. The only thing he's left are those photos, which leads me to believe he doesn't even know that he has that ability.  ",4,2
"MULDER: You may be right, Scully, you should check it out. Let me know what you find.  ",4,2
MULDER: I'll be back in DC. I want special photo to run this. I still think the answer is in here.  ,4,2
"MULDER: Well, that's all the more reason to fully investigate the one and only hard piece of evidence we do have. I'll be in touch.  ",4,2
"MULDER: Can you get rid of the blurriness surrounding her, here?  ",4,2
MULDER: Why do you say that?  ,4,2
"MULDER: What about this face, here? Can you bring that up at all?  ",4,2
"MULDER: OK, do that.  ",4,2
"MULDER: OK, thank you. (hangs up) NCIC shows no match for that man. (he points to two dark lines near the man's head) How about this shape up here? What is that? (they zoom out and see that the lines curve around a large area at the top of the photo) Can you take that and flip it so that that's on the bottom? Is that a shadow?  ",4,2
"MULDER: It's the kidnapper's shadow. It's like he's looming over her, it's like he's standing over her, he means to pass judgement on her, like a god.  ",4,2
"MULDER: (on phone) Scully, I may have something for you on the kidnapper. It's something about his legs.  ",4,2
"MULDER: They're unusually long, they're out of proportion. I'm thinking he's either very tall, or he's not but wants to be. Scully? Scully, are you there?  ",4,2
"MULDER: You want to tell us about the first time you were arrested, Gerry? In 1980, you attacked your father with an axe handle. You beat him so severely that he spent the remainder of his life in a wheelchair.  ",4,2
"MULDER: Yeah, Gerald Thomas Schnauz, diagnosed and treated for a paranoid schizophrenic disorder six years in Melvoin Psychiatric Hospital, released 1986. So what you been up to since 1986, Gerry?  ",4,2
"MULDER: Well, how did you feel about that?  ",4,2
"MULDER: Says here that you have a sister. Where is your sister, Gerry?  ",4,2
"MULDER: Actually, it says here she committed suicide in 1980. That was a bad year. What else happened in 1980, Gerry?  ",4,2
"MULDER: Hey, Gerry. This your father?  ",4,2
"MULDER: You left it for me. You left it like a fingerprint. Is this what you see when you close your eyes, Gerry?  ",4,2
MULDER: Is that what you see? Gerry ... tell me where Alice Brandt is.  ,4,2
MULDER: Gerry ... Tell me how I can find her.  ,4,2
"MULDER: Hey, Scully, that word ""unruhe"", ""unrest"", is bothering me. Maybe he thought he was curing them somehow, saving him from damnation, from those things in the pictures, you know, he called them the howlers.  ",4,2
"MULDER: Well, then that photo wouldn't be his fantasy. It would be his nightmare.  ",4,2
MULDER: Because I want to know.  ,4,2
MULDER: This wound's in the wrong place. He was shot in the throat. He wasn't trying to save this victim.  ,4,2
MULDER: He took the passport camera and all the film in the store.  ,4,2
MULDER: He wants to continue his work.  ,4,2
MULDER: You think you interrupted his stalking?  ,4,2
MULDER: Hold on a second. You bring the car around. I just want to wait for this. I'll be right there.  ,4,2
MULDER: Scully! Scully!  ,4,2
MULDER: Scully!  ,4,2
MULDER: Any sightings?  ,4,2
MULDER: He's switching cars. He's going to do that two or three times. (looking back at the photograph) (to himself) He's got six fingers here...  ,4,2
MULDER: (to himself) He's got six fingers. (to Corning) What about his apartment?  ,4,2
"MULDER: What about friends, relatives, co-workers? Does he have a summer house? A winter house?  ",4,2
MULDER: Let me see his wallet.  ,4,2
"MULDER: (reading from the clipping) Recipient of the Bronze Star medal during the Korean War ... Gerald Schnauz, Sr., DDS. He's a retired dentist.  ",4,2
MULDER: He was here.  ,4,2
"MULDER: Six fingers, right. (Corning starts to talk to him) Why are there six? (to Corning) What?  ",4,2
MULDER: Damn it!  ,4,2
MULDER: That's five headstones. And the father makes six. Come on! (He runs out.)  ,4,2
MULDER: Fan out. Check the tree line.  ,4,2
MULDER: (shouts) Scully!  ,4,2
MULDER: Scully!  ,4,2
"MULDER: (to Scully) Are you hurt? (Scully shakes her head) (to Corning, who has arrived at the door) Get an ambulance!  ",4,2
MULDER: Smell that.  ,4,3
"MULDER: Scully, you don't know me as well as you think you do. You know, my work demands that I live in a big city, but if I had to settle down, build a home... be a place like this.  ",4,3
MULDER: For real?  ,4,3
"MULDER: Hey, Sheriff, who lives in that house there?  ",4,3
"MULDER: Well, maybe we should take a look at the victim then.  ",4,3
MULDER: Fife?  ,4,3
"MULDER: Well, you could just lock your door to the office.  ",4,3
"MULDER: I guess we can rule out murder as the cause of death, huh?  ",4,3
MULDER: There's something rotten in Mayberry.  ,4,3
MULDER: Apparently not much in this case if she just threw it out with the trash.  ,4,3
"MULDER: Why, is there a history of genetic abnormalities in your family?  ",4,3
"MULDER: Well, just find yourself a man with a spotless genetic make-up and a really high tolerance for being second-guessed and start pumping out the little Uber-Scullies.  ",4,3
"MULDER: Hmm? Well, aside from the need for corrective lenses and a tendency to be abducted by extraterrestrials involved in an international governmental conspiracy, the Mulder family passes genetic muster.  ",4,3
MULDER: We should let local authorities investigate that.  ,4,3
"MULDER: Scully, uh, Sheriff Taylor, uh, implied that the boys in that family were not really the type that could easily get dates.  ",4,3
MULDER: Do we?  ,4,3
"MULDER: Yeah, yeah, but there's no sister. The mother's been dead for ten years.  ",4,3
MULDER: And kidnapping is a bureau matter.  ,4,3
"MULDER: Yeah, if we can find them. They probably bolted when they saw us coming.  ",4,3
"MULDER: If the mother is alive, they probably took her with them.  ",4,3
"MULDER: Whoa! Don't move, don't move.  ",4,3
MULDER: Not if I can't get the Knicks game.  ,4,3
"MULDER: Good night, Mom.  ",4,3
"MULDER: Oh, you don't have to, uh, lock your doors around here.  ",4,3
MULDER: Big American car.  ,4,3
MULDER: Where are they?  ,4,3
MULDER: His chest is one big hematoma. There's wood shavings embedded in what's left of the cranium.  ,4,3
MULDER: You suspected these abnormalities.  ,4,3
MULDER: Triple?  ,4,3
MULDER: What if generations of autosomal breeding could produce such a mutation?  ,4,3
"MULDER: Well, in any case, they haven't ventured too far from home. We should request back-ups from Pittsburgh and go pick them up.  ",4,3
"MULDER: Yeah, but we're outnumbered. We could further endanger the victim in doing that.  ",4,3
"MULDER: Oh, that was just a little bit too Chuck Bronson for me, Scully.  ",4,3
"MULDER: Ah, they probably heard about the warrants issued for their arrest.  ",4,3
"MULDER: No, we searched the house, Scully, they weren't home.  ",4,3
MULDER: We're getting into position.  ,4,3
"MULDER: The eldest will move in to ensure the prey has been killed, and circling the prey signals to the others that it's safe to approach.  ",4,3
"MULDER: Yeah, but we can try and divert them out of the house.  ",4,3
"MULDER: Yeah, that'll work.  ",4,3
"MULDER: And people call me ""Spooky.""  ",4,3
"MULDER: Oh, no.  ",4,3
"MULDER: It's all right, ma'am!  ",4,3
MULDER: We're federal agents! We're here to help you!  ,4,3
MULDER: Ma'am.  ,4,3
MULDER: They've got her strapped to some kind of board or something.  ,4,3
"MULDER: Ma'am, we're here to help you. Calm down. Ma'am, we're here to help. We're from the F.B.I.  ",4,3
MULDER: The others may have heard the screams. I'm going to check on their position.  ,4,3
MULDER: She's not going anywhere.  ,4,3
MULDER: I'm sure she's an accessory. At least she aided and abetted.  ,4,3
"MULDER: Which means that when Edmund was a kid, he could ground the other two for playing with his things? The brothers killed three people, Scully. Tell her we're going to bring them in... and try convincing her that she's the one way they can get out of this without any of her boys getting hurt. All right, I'm going to keep an eye on them.  ",4,3
MULDER: Scully!  ,4,3
MULDER: Where's the other brother... Edmund?  ,4,3
"MULDER: I looked everywhere, they're both gone.  ",4,3
"MULDER: I think time already caught them, Scully.  ",4,3
MULDER: Hey. I heard you were down here slicing and dicing. Whos the lucky stiff?  ,4,4
"MULDER: Theres a Michael Jackson joke in here somewhere, but I cant quite find it. (Thank you, Mulder.)  ",4,4
MULDER: Requested by whom?  ,4,4
MULDER: The CDC in a kidnap case?  ,4,4
MULDER: Based on what other evidence?  ,4,4
"MULDER: (eating sunflower seed) Thats interesting. What, uh, what sort of disease is this?  ",4,4
MULDER: So this man died of a disorder. He and four other young black men who conveniently contracted the disease in succession and then disappeared without any explanation whatsoever.  ,4,4
"MULDER: Scully, has it occurred to you that this might just be a...a little PR exercise?  ",4,4
MULDER: To divert attention from the fact that young black men are dying and nobody seems to be able to bring in a suspect? The perception being that nobody cares.  ,4,4
MULDER: (cracks sunflower seed)  ,4,4
MULDER: Did you lift any forensic evidence from the body?  ,4,4
MULDER: (taking evidence) Im going to join the snipe hunt .... if you dont mind .... before the body count rises. (He leaves. SCULLY sighs.)  ,4,4
MULDER: Agent Pendrell. Thanks for turning this materials analysis around on such short notice.  ,4,4
MULDER: Shes not coming.  ,4,4
MULDER: She had a date.  ,4,4
"MULDER: Breathe, Agent Pendrell. Its with a dead man. (puts his hands on PENDRELLS shoulders) Shes doing an autopsy. (PENDRELL smiles) You said you found something?  ",4,4
"MULDER: Well, it looks like some kind of thorn.  ",4,4
MULDER: Help me out.  ,4,4
"MULDER: How could something this small travel 5,000 miles around the world and wind up on Owen Sanders?  ",4,4
MULDER: (on phone) It contains a cerebropathic glycoside. Does that mean anything to you?  ,4,4
MULDER: (on phone) Is it lethal?  ,4,4
MULDER: (on phone) Did the toxicology scan detect any of it in Owen Sanders blood?  ,4,4
MULDER: (on phone) Could his body have metabolized the substance?  ,4,4
MULDER: (on phone) Does that tell you anything about anything?  ,4,4
MULDER: (voice) His pituitary gland?  ,4,4
MULDER: (on phone) So you found evidence that this is a disease?  ,4,4
"MULDER: (on phone) Okay, well why dont you let me know as soon as you find anything out.  ",4,4
MULDER: (on phone) Off to water the seeds of doubt. Bye-bye. (Mulder said bye?!?!?!)  ,4,4
MULDER: Ms. Covarrubias?  ,4,4
MULDER: Agent Mulder. Fox Mulder.  ,4,4
MULDER: Sorry I frightened you.  ,4,4
"MULDER: Im not sure why, but I thought you might be in a position to help me.  ",4,4
MULDER: Four young men are missing in Philadelphia. One of the men was found dead last night. This seed was recovered from the victims body. (Shows vial) Its from a rare species of plant found only in West Africa. Do you know anything about this case?  ,4,4
MULDER: Is there any way you could find something out about it?  ,4,4
MULDER: Is that a yes or a no.  ,4,4
"MULDER: (Stopping her from leaving) You cant, or you wont? You made an overture to me. You left an opening. Tell me Im wrong. Tell me theres nothing here and Ill just walk away. Either way, I need to know.  ",4,4
MULDER: What happened here?  ,4,4
MULDER: How does she know hes missing?  ,4,4
MULDER: (checking ground) Or a reaction to a powerful cortical depressant.  ,4,4
MULDER: You find Alfred Kittel and you find another one of those weird African seeds.  ,4,4
"MULDER: (hands her folder) Three months ago  one week before the first person was reported missing  the New York Port Authority filed that with the FAA. (Picture of dead man on plane.) Like Owen Sanders, this man wasnt an albino either. Not until he was found dead on a charter flight from West Africa, from Burkina Faso. The Embassy demanded that the body be returned before an autopsy could be performed.  ",4,4
"MULDER: Yeah, undetermined, Scully, but not necessarily unknown.  ",4,4
MULDER: Im sorry. We wont take up much of your time. The INS District Chief told us that you were in charge of most of the casework for aliens emigrating from Africa and the Caribbean.  ,4,4
"MULDER: Well, were looking for somebody that came a little more recently than that. (checks paper) On a flight from Burkina Faso? This is the passenger manifest from the charter company.  ",4,4
MULDER: Id like you to cross reference those names on that list with anyone applying for permanent resident status or a work visa within the last three months.  ,4,4
MULDER: Hes not home. We might as well get comfortable.  ,4,4
"MULDER: Scully, I think if you looked up from the microscope for a minute, youd see that whats really missing is a motive.  ",4,4
MULDER: If this is a health crisis.  ,4,4
MULDER: Maybe we wont have to wait. (Gets out of car) Mr. Aboah? Can I talk to you a minute?  ,4,4
"MULDER: Boy, this guy can move.  ",4,4
MULDER: He has to be.  ,4,4
"MULDER: Hey, Scully. Look at this.  ",4,4
MULDER: Nothing?  ,4,4
"MULDER: Well, hes some kind of case the way he disappeared down that drain pipe.  ",4,4
MULDER: About Alfred Kittel and about several other young men who have gone missing since his arrival in Philadelphia three months ago.  ,4,4
"MULDER: We only arrested him because he ran when we tried to question him, and I want to know why he ran.  ",4,4
"MULDER: That man ran because hes hiding something. (to SCULLY) And no amount of tests you run on him, no science is going to find that. Excuse me. (leaves angrily)  ",4,4
"MULDER: To find someone who I know plotted to deceive, inveigle and obfuscate. (SCULLY looks at DUFF and sighs.)  ",4,4
"MULDER: Thank you for seeing me at such a late hour, sir.  ",4,4
"MULDER: With all due respect, sir, I think you already know.  ",4,4
"MULDER: `Something happened on a flight from your country about three months ago --- something that you felt compelled to hide even from your own ambassador. The State Department said the request to stop investigating this mans death came directly from you. (shows picture of dead airplane man) Now, I understand the need to protect your diplomatic position, but more men are dying, sir.  ",4,4
"MULDER: Youd be surprised at what I believe, sir.  ",4,4
MULDER: This time?  ,4,4
MULDER: What kinds of stories?  ,4,4
"MULDER: Come out to do what, sir?  ",4,4
"MULDER: Then, it was a nightmare.  ",4,4
MULDER: (entering) Youll have to find him first.  ,4,4
MULDER: I was looking for you down in quarantine. Samuel Aboahs gone. Disappeared.  ,4,4
MULDER is looking in drawer  ,4,4
MULDER: (Pulling something out of the drawer.) I think this was his getaway vehicle. (Looks at top of cart.) He didnt even touch his Jell-O.  ,4,4
MULDER: (nods)  ,4,4
"MULDER: This guy can squeeze into a coffee can, Scully. He could be anywhere.  ",4,4
MULDER: Hell find another victim.  ,4,4
MULDER: We interrupted him before he could finish.  ,4,4
"MULDER: The killing is just incidental I think, Scully, to a far more basic need.  ",4,4
"MULDER: (driving) If Aboah has no pituitary then his body would lack the ability to produce melanin itself, right?  ",4,4
"MULDER: Well, when you examined him you didnt observe one single albino trait or characteristic.  ",4,4
"MULDER: Thats what Im talking about, Scully, survival. And not just Aboahs. I think that anomaly you observed is not just physiological, I think it may be evolutionary.  ",4,4
"MULDER: The lost tribe, a clan of sub-Saharan albinos linked by their common congenital deficit whove adapted over generations by ....  ",4,4
"MULDER: Somehow, Aboah has managed to survive.  ",4,4
MULDER: Because of something somebody told me last night. (Pause) An African folktale.  ,4,4
"MULDER: Its just another way of describing the same truth, right? I mean all new truths begin as heresies and end as superstitions. We ... we fear the unknown, so we reduce it to the terms that are most familiar to us, whether thats a folktale, or a disease, or a ...... conspiracy. (smile)  ",4,4
"MULDER: Free cable. I dont know, the same reasons anybody comes to this country. Liberty, the freedom to pursue your own interests. (Sees construction site) Look at that.  ",4,4
MULDER: (Stopping car) Its a demolition site. (They get out of car.)  ,4,4
MULDER: Pendrell found asbestos fibers on Owen Sanders body. And you remove asbestos from an old building before you tear it down. It had to come from somewhere.  ,4,4
MULDER: Ow.  ,4,4
MULDER: Scully? (yells) Scully!  ,4,4
"MULDER: At times, I almost dream.  ",4,5
MULDER: Somebody tipped Ephesian off.  ,4,5
MULDER: F.B.I.  ,4,5
MULDER: But that message was to the church of Symrna. It's my understanding that your temple is the reincarnation of the church of Ephesia.  ,4,5
MULDER: Are you?  ,4,5
MULDER: Let's start with her.  ,4,5
MULDER: Where are you from?  ,4,5
MULDER: Does it bother you that he has other wives?  ,4,5
MULDER: We were told that Vernon's been hurting the children.  ,4,5
MULDER: Sidney?  ,4,5
"MULDER: Sidney, can you tell me who the president of the United States is right now?  ",4,5
MULDER: It's not just that. Somehow I just knew.  ,4,5
"MULDER: Come up with something? We found ""Sidney."" Voice spectrogram confirms that Melissa Riedal's vocal pattern matches the A.T.F. ""Sidney"" call.  ",4,5
"MULDER: But there is a personality in her that wants to. We need a psychological catalyst. I suggest we take her back to the compound. Maybe exposing her to that environment with Ephesian present will somehow enable Melissa to talk, or a personality inside her.  ",4,5
"MULDER: What we witnessed meets the criteria established in the D.S.M.-IV. The presence of two distinct personality states that would currently take control over behavior, including the ""protector"" identity, Sidney. The inability to recall important personal information. She couldn't recall her own hometown. Transitions from one personality state to another are usually a matter of seconds and are often caused by psychosocial stress. Sidney appeared when we mentioned the children had been abused.  ",4,5
MULDER: Judicial precedents have established that dissociative personalities are responsible.  ,4,5
MULDER: What we are responsible for is the potential loss of fifty lives.  ,4,5
MULDER: Because he wouldn't believe me.  ,4,5
"MULDER: You're safe with us, Melissa. The murderer's not here.  ",4,5
"MULDER: Sidney, you can all go home. You can all be safe if you tell us where they hid the guns.  ",4,5
MULDER: I'm arranging for a therapist trained in hypnosis to be at the command center.  ,4,5
"MULDER: She wants to talk, Scully. It's a matter of getting it out of her.  ",4,5
"MULDER: You, you were there, Scully! You saw it. You heard it. Why can't you feel it?  ",4,5
MULDER: You know how to find the other bunkers.  ,4,5
MULDER: Melissa...  ,4,5
MULDER: There is one way.  ,4,5
"MULDER: Wouldn't you, Scully? Wouldn't anybody?  ",4,5
MULDER: Ghetto streets... shattered glass... bodies of the dead... I'm a woman... a Jewish woman... Poland. My son is with me. He is Samantha.  ,4,5
"MULDER: In this life, she is my son.  ",4,5
MULDER: My soul is tired. I want to rest.  ,4,5
"MULDER: Dana, if, um... early in the four years we've been working together... an event occurred that suggested or somebody told you that... we'd been friends together in other lifetimes... always... wouldn't it have changed some of the ways we looked at one another?  ",4,5
MULDER: Why?  ,4,5
MULDER: Sarah... if it were true... no life would be pointless.  ,4,5
"MULDER: Ephesian preaches and his followers' believe that the F.B.I. and the A.T.F. are the devil's army, prophesied in Revelations 12:17, to make war on ""the seed which keep the commandments of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ.""  ",4,5
MULDER: I would be saying that if I thought he believed in Revelations in its entirety... but he hid the weapons.  ,4,5
"MULDER: If he doesn't believe that he can defeat the devil's army, he may think that by denying himself and his followers to the devil... by denying himself, do you understand? He will achieve for them the reward of life ""forevermore..."" and our worst fears will be realized.  ",4,5
MULDER: Is there contact with the temple?  ,4,5
"MULDER: At times, I almost dream.  ",4,5
"MULDER: Spirit possession or demon possession. While these kinds of extraordinary mental states have been well documented throughout history, theyve been much maligned, rightly or wrongly, and havent held up in court well as a criminal defense.  ",4,6
"MULDER: Yes, I believe we have.  ",4,6
MULDER: Ive heard of it.  ,4,6
"MULDER: What  What was the date of ah, Dr. Lloyds prescription?  ",4,6
MULDER: (looking at attractive nurse in the hall) Wow.  ,4,6
MULDER: An addiction in other words.  ,4,6
MULDER: How many of these procedures would you say Dr. Lloyds performed?  ,4,6
MULDER: And not one fatality.  ,4,6
"MULDER: Everybodys doing it, so I hear.  ",4,6
MULDER: (bending down to look at marks on bloody floor) What do you suppose these are?  ,4,6
MULDER: These five marks on your brand new state of the art floor?  ,4,6
MULDER: They look to me like they were burned or scorched.  ,4,6
MULDER: In the shape of a pentagram.  ,4,6
"MULDER: Im not a doctor , Scully, but youve got to be pushing pretty hard to mistake a beer belly for a bald head  not to mention door number three.  ",4,6
MULDER: Its amazing that no one saw him in time to stop him.  ,4,6
"MULDER: I dont think its just a simple possession, Scully. I think its more like sorcery or black magic or something like that.  ",4,6
"MULDER: (to NURSE WAITE) Excuse me, what kind of procedure is that up there? (indicates OR 5)  ",4,6
MULDER: Are you aware that Dr. Lloyd is claiming he was possessed during the incident?  ,4,6
MULDER: Uh huh. (smiles)  ,4,6
MULDER: Yeah. A videotape. (Puts tape in VCR.) This videotape of the operation shows that the five marks delineating the pentagram were in evidence prior to the patients death.  ,4,6
MULDER: Which only underscores the strangeness. A sane man acting under his own volition could never perform such an act. Look. (points out marks) There.  ,4,6
MULDER: I dont know. A pentagram is supposed to be a symbol of protection and positive power used to control the elemental forces.  ,4,6
"MULDER: Yeah, but it does make sense that - that witchcraft or black magic would find a theatre in a place like this, preying on the weak and vainglorious.  ",4,6
"MULDER: Maybe there is. What was that, uh, prescription that Dr. Lloyd was taking?  ",4,6
"MULDER: No, the stomach antacid. Read me what its made from.  ",4,6
MULDER: Belladonna. Its also known as Witchs Berry  thats an herb used in hexing rituals.  ,4,6
"MULDER: Yeah, just one  the one Dr. Lloyd was taking.  ",4,6
"MULDER: (smiles sarcastically, wounded) You jest, Scully, but theres a good chance that this hex or ritual or whatever it is, may not be finished.  ",4,6
MULDER: Did you examine the victim?  ,4,6
"MULDER: I found something else on the videotape. (SCULLY glances at the computer screen, then follows MULDER to VCR. He pauses the tape.) Right there.  ",4,6
"MULDER: I dont know, but the orientation of the points describes a pentagram again. See.  ",4,6
MULDER: Thats the same prescription Dr. Lloyd was taking.  ,4,6
MULDER: It appears weve interrupted a *gathering.*  ,4,6
MULDER: Were any of you here at the time?  ,4,6
MULDER: Have you spoken with her?  ,4,6
MULDER: Probable cause.  ,4,6
MULDER: Probably not tax returns.  ,4,6
MULDER: I want to speak to her.;  ,4,6
MULDER: I need to speak to her ...  ,4,6
"MULDER: (knocks) Dr, Franklyn?  ",4,6
MULDER: I came by to see if you were okay.  ,4,6
MULDER: Looks like she took a pretty good shot at you.  ,4,6
"MULDER: (big friendly smile) Nothing that a little plastic surgery wont fix up though, huh? (DR. FRANKLYN looks at MULDER) Do you have any uh, idea why she might have attacked you?  ",4,6
MULDER: She wouldnt have known that.  ,4,6
"MULDER: Ah, we have reason to believe that shes a practitioner of ritual magic.  ",4,6
MULDER: A practicing witch.  ,4,6
MULDER: I think a lot remains to be proven.  ,4,6
"MULDER: (turning from mirror) Come in, its open.  ",4,6
"MULDER: God, you look tired.  ",4,6
MULDER: Cause of death?  ,4,6
MULDER: You ever seen anything like that?  ,4,6
"MULDER: She would have died long before she yacked them up on the driveway. Unless, of course she didnt ingest them at all, which would fit with the phenomenon called allotriophagy.  ",4,6
"MULDER: (showing her book) Yeah, the spontaneous vomiting or disgorgement of foul or strange objects usually associated with someone possessed.  ",4,6
"MULDER: Well, according to this book people throughout history have coughed up all kinds of things from cue balls to butchers knives without any explanation of how they got there.  ",4,6
"MULDER: Rebecca Waites house. Its the same place I got this. (crosses to desk and picks up a calendar) This calendar was open to April. The 30th was marked by a symbol that youre familiar with by now? (marked with a pentagram and word ""Roodmas"")  ",4,6
"MULDER: Its one of the four Greater Witches' Sabbaths, there seasonal high holy days  according to that book over there, its also known as ""Roodmas."" Its also the birth date of the first victim. (thumbs through calendar) Now July 31st, is also marked with a pentagram. This coincides with ""Lammas"", another one of the Witches' Sabbaths. Its also the birth date of the second victim.  ",4,6
"MULDER: No, no, remember, I said the pentagram is a - is a protective symbol. I think Rebecca Waite was trying to save those patients. I think she knew that they were in danger.  ",4,6
MULDER: I think she knew something about him and I think we should find out what that is before he goes back to work.  ,4,6
MULDER: When is that patient scheduled?  ,4,6
MULDER: Were looking for Dr. Shannon.  ,4,6
"MULDER: ""Mistakes?"" Like those patient deaths ten years ago?  ",4,6
MULDER: There were five deaths?  ,4,6
MULDER: What was his name?  ,4,6
MULDER: Do you have a file on him?  ,4,6
"MULDER: All right, Im going to need that and the files on those patient deaths ten years ago.  ",4,6
"MULDER: Dr. Clifford Cox, birth date July 7th 1939, now can you take that photo and run it through the cosmetic surgery program I saw on this computer?  ",4,6
"MULDER: Ten years ago, four patients died. Like the recent victims, their birth dates all match the Witches' Sabbaths. Except Dr. Cox.  ",4,6
"MULDER: Maybe, maybe not.  ",4,6
"MULDER: Okay, now this software was created to give patients an idea of their projected result, right?  ",4,6
"MULDER: Vanity. (Looks at SCULLY.) Vanity, ... all is vanity.  ",4,6
"MULDER: Now, can you move the eyes further apart and strengthen the forehead?  ",4,6
"MULDER: I know. (DR. SHANNON and SCULLY look confused. DR. SHANNON types, looks more confused.)  ",4,6
MULDER: Did you try his home?  ,4,6
"MULDER: No, Scully. I think he murdered those patients so he could become Dr. Franklyn. (Hands her pictures of COX and FRANKLYN.)  ",4,6
"MULDER: Its not medicine, Scully. Its blood sacrifice.  ",4,6
"MULDER: The most potent offering in black magic. What if this man, having reached the limits of medical miracles, decided to stage a miracle all his own?  ",4,6
"MULDER: Everybody wants to be beautiful, Scully.  ",4,6
MULDER: Dr. Franklyn?  ,4,6
"MULDER: Scully, come over here. (She walks back to stairs.) Stop right there. Look what youre standing on. (It is a pentagram on the tile floor. MULDER comes back down. ) This ones different. Its been inverted. See these two upright points here? They represent the God of Lust, attacking heaven with its horns.  ",4,6
MULDER: Wheres Dr. Shannon? They said she was brought in here in an emergency?  ,4,6
MULDER: Dont let them operate on her. (Runs down hall.) Hold them off until you hear from me!  ,4,6
MULDER: To find Dr. Franklyn. (he is gone)  ,4,6
MULDER: What happened?  ,4,6
MULDER: Then it failed.  ,4,6
MULDER: What is this patients birth date?  ,4,6
MULDER: On Samhain ... the Fourth Witches Sabbath.  ,4,6
"MULDER: One at a time, boys. Now what's going on?  ",4,7
"MULDER: I've been here twenty minutes and I still don't know what the hell is wrong! No one would kill you, Frohike, you're just a little puppy-dog.  ",4,7
MULDER: Cancer Man? What did you find?  ,4,7
"MULDER: Sorry, nobody down here but the FBI's most unwanted.  ",4,7
"MULDER: Oh, isn't it nice to be suddenly so highly regarded? So, who did you tick off to get stuck with this detail, Scully?  ",4,7
"MULDER: Oh, really? I was under the impression... that you were sent to spy on me.  ",4,7
"MULDER: Concentrate on this area, over here. Right there.  ",4,8
"MULDER: I'm not sure I can explain, Scully.  ",4,8
"MULDER: Just give me a minute, Scully, okay?  ",4,8
MULDER: I keep having this dream. It's about a little blond girl.  ,4,8
"MULDER: I've had... flashes of it, three nights in a row. And last night, it went on long enough to lead me right to her.  ",4,8
MULDER: I know what happened here. She was strangled. He used an eight-gauge electrical cord. He took something from the body post-mortem... a trophy. A piece of fabric cut from her clothes... in the shape of a heart.  ,4,8
MULDER: No. I know this M.O. I know it from memory.  ,4,8
MULDER: John Lee Roche. He killed thirteen eight-to-ten year-old girls.  ,4,8
"MULDER: It was a difficult case, he was extremely hard to catch.  ",4,8
"MULDER: I concluded that, that we were probably looking for a salesman. Someone who, who traveled around a lot, someone who could gain people's confidence, someone ordinary.  ",4,8
"MULDER: We never found them, but we didn't need them to make the case. We had him cold on thirteen counts of murder. He admitted to thirteen. Polygraph said he was telling the truth. But that always bugged me about this case. I always wanted to find those hearts and count them, see if they really added up to thirteen. I guess they didn't.  ",4,8
MULDER: So you think that I've somehow had this information about a fourteenth victim all the time and I've been processing it unconsciously?  ,4,8
MULDER: 1975 is too early.  ,4,8
MULDER: That would mean Roche started way before we thought he did.  ,4,8
"MULDER: Yes, sir, and he won't get out.  ",4,8
MULDER: It's not a good job.  ,4,8
MULDER: Sir?  ,4,8
"MULDER: Roche's car... Roche drove a white El Camino, Scully. I saw it in my dream.  ",4,8
"MULDER: The cloth hearts he collected, he would have wanted to keep them close to him. For a traveling salesman, that means inside the car, right?  ",4,8
"MULDER: Well, he doesn't have them in prison, the cell is searched regularly, his mail is examined. His car was sold at auction in 1992, put beyond his reach. It's worth a look, Scully. We've got to find those hearts in order to count them.  ",4,8
MULDER: Not by me.  ,4,8
MULDER: Helping him detail.  ,4,8
"MULDER: ""Mad Hat...""  ",4,8
"MULDER: Eight... nine, ten... eleven, twelve... thirteen, fourteen...  ",4,8
MULDER: He had two more victims.  ,4,8
MULDER: Agent Scully.  ,4,8
"MULDER: We found Addie Sparks, John.  ",4,8
"MULDER: Sixteen victims, John. How come you only said there were only thirteen?  ",4,8
"MULDER: Why don't you tell us about your last two victims, then?  ",4,8
MULDER: You can gain one moment of decency in your life. You can finally let those families put their daughters to rest.  ,4,8
MULDER: Samantha...  ,4,8
"MULDER: ""The Magician"" comes on at nine.  ",4,8
MULDER: They're next door at the Galbrands'. They left me in charge.  ,4,8
MULDER: Samantha!  ,4,8
"MULDER: Yesterday, you said something about me taking it personally. Why did you say that to me?  ",4,8
MULDER: November. Twenty-seventh of November. Do you know what I'm getting at?  ,4,8
MULDER: What do you know about my sister?  ,4,8
"MULDER: He was there, Scully. He was in the house. He took Samantha.  ",4,8
"MULDER: A dream is an answer to a question we haven't yet figured out how to ask, right? Something buried in your subconsciousness. You heard him in there, he knew something. He mentioned being on Martha's Vineyard.  ",4,8
"MULDER: Well, how would he find out about that?  ",4,8
MULDER: Looking for what?  ,4,8
"MULDER: My last dream came true. Scully, do you believe that my sister Samantha was abducted by aliens?  ",4,8
MULDER: I don't know. I don't know what happened. I don't know what to believe. I just know that I have to find out now.  ,4,8
"MULDER: Mom, I'm in the basement.  ",4,8
MULDER: Do you recognize... these fabrics? Either one of them?  ,4,8
MULDER: Just look closely. Do... do they seem familiar to you?  ,4,8
MULDER: Just familiar. Have you seen them before?  ,4,8
MULDER: It's all right.  ,4,8
"MULDER: Dad never bought you a vacuum cleaner, did he?  ",4,8
MULDER: Where is it?  ,4,8
MULDER: Sir? I've been denied further access to John Lee Roche. I've been told that order comes down from you.  ,4,8
MULDER: Sir...  ,4,8
MULDER: I have reason to believe he can tell us what happened to my sister Samantha.  ,4,8
"MULDER: I need to know. I just need to speak with him one more time, sir.  ",4,8
MULDER: No. You don't get to touch them. They stay in the bag. Name them.  ,4,8
MULDER: How could you know what I said?  ,4,8
"MULDER: If that's true, tell me where my sister is.  ",4,8
MULDER: What?  ,4,8
"MULDER: Help me, Scully.  ",4,8
"MULDER: It's not her, Scully. Am I right? Samantha broke her collarbone when she was six.  ",4,8
"MULDER: It's somebody, though.  ",4,8
"MULDER: If that's true, tell me where.  ",4,8
MULDER: You just want to get out of here.  ,4,8
MULDER: This is Special Agent Fox Mulder with the F.B.I.  ,4,8
MULDER: Keep your hands in your lap.  ,4,8
MULDER: Excuse me.  ,4,8
"MULDER: Excuse me, I have to get by.  ",4,8
MULDER: Now!  ,4,8
MULDER: Go.  ,4,8
MULDER: Where'd they go?  ,4,8
MULDER: Go on.  ,4,8
MULDER: And then what did you do?  ,4,8
MULDER: That's exactly how it happened? Right here in this room?  ,4,8
MULDER: Wrong house.  ,4,8
"MULDER: No. No, but I think I know what happened. Somehow you got inside my dreams.  ",4,8
"MULDER: I profiled you. I got inside your head, maybe you got inside mine. Maybe some nexus or connection was formed between us and through that, you got access to my memories of my sister Samantha and you used them against me for this.  ",4,8
"MULDER: And you're in the wrong house, you stupid son of a bitch! You were never here, you liar!  ",4,8
"MULDER: Yeah, but you remember all the other details so vividly. That's because you watched it through my eyes... through my dreams.  ",4,8
"MULDER: You must have been one hell of a salesman, Roche. First flight's at six A.M. Why don't you enjoy your last few hours of freedom? Come on.  ",4,8
"MULDER: He must have done it in my sleep, I had another dream.  ",4,8
MULDER: He took the last cloth heart.  ,4,8
MULDER: I don't.  ,4,8
MULDER: Yeah.  ,4,8
MULDER: Where's your phone?  ,4,8
"MULDER: Yeah, please put me through to your supervisor.  ",4,8
"MULDER: This is Fox Mulder of the F.B.I. I'd like a passenger manifest for flight sixteen-fifty from Washington National to Boston, 8:50 P.M. last night. My badge number is J-T-T...  ",4,8
MULDER: It's not your fault. It's my fault.  ,4,8
"MULDER: None of that really matters now, does it?  ",4,8
"MULDER: There's no reason for that, he knows we're going to catch him. He just needs it be sooner than later. He's going to stay in the Boston area. It'll be somewhere nearby.  ",4,8
"MULDER: Try to relive some past glory? Is that what you're thinking? I don't know, what?  ",4,8
MULDER: He's there.  ,4,8
"MULDER: Alice, ""Alice in Wonderland,"" he's the Mad Hatter.  ",4,8
MULDER: That's where he got the idea in the first place.  ,4,8
MULDER: He never brought anyone here.  ,4,8
"MULDER: Are you okay, Caitlin?  ",4,8
"MULDER: Caitlin, can you do me a favor? Can you count to twenty? Can you do that? Will you close your eyes and count to twenty out loud, quietly and slowly?  ",4,8
MULDER: Don't make this end badly.  ,4,8
MULDER: How?  ,4,8
"MULDER: We can't go in too soon. We have to be patient, it'll happen.  ",4,9
"MULDER: I've received receipts over the past few weeks for detonation cord, for racing and diesel fuel, and for 80 bags of ammonium nitrate purchased in cash in three different states under three different signatures.  ",4,9
"MULDER:  I've received two new receipts, one for first and last on this storage space, and one to rent a two-ton truck yesterday. Both with the same signatures. We could be looking at the next Oklahoma City.  ",4,9
MULDER:  Hold it.  ,4,9
MULDER:  I counted two men.  ,4,9
MULDER: Get out of the truck.  ,4,9
MULDER: Get out of the truck!  ,4,9
MULDER: Let me see your hands! Hands in the air!  ,4,9
MULDER: You son of a bitch!.  ,4,9
"MULDER: Oh, come on, Krycek!  ",4,9
MULDER: I'm sure you had no trouble adapting.  ,4,9
"MULDER: You're full of crap, Krycek. You're an invertebrate scum-sucker whose moral dipstick is about two drops short of bone dry.  ",4,9
MULDER: Then why don't you put a bullet in his head like you did that man out there?  ,4,9
MULDER:  The only thing that will destroy this man is the truth.  ,4,9
MULDER: (smiles) We can't help you Krycek.  ,4,9
"MULDER: There it is, Air Lacayo, 6:45. Fifteen minutes ago.  Come on, let's go.  (Places a hand on Krycek's back, urges him forward.)  ",4,9
MULDER: Show him.  ,4,9
"MULDER: Expose it for him, Scully.  ",4,9
"MULDER: What did you get for Halloween, Charlie Brown?  ",4,9
"MULDER: I need to speak with you, sir.  ",4,9
MULDER: I need your authorization to provide a safe house.  ,4,9
MULDER:  (Reaches to his left and yanks Krycek into view by the collar of his jacket.  He has his baseball cap again.)  This man has information about extreme-right militia that could save the lives of innocent Americans.  ,4,9
"MULDER: But you have an idea, don't you?  ",4,9
MULDER:  Is it valuable?  ,4,9
MULDER: I think we'd all like to know what's in that rock.  ,4,9
MULDER (on phone): Thank you.  ,4,9
"MULDER: Big dead end at the State Department, but U.S. Customs officials detained another courier on a similar visa in Honolulu two nights ago. He was coming from Russian Georgia carrying some kind of toxic soil sample.  ",4,9
"MULDER: Yes, which leads me to believe what's in this rock we intercepted are answers beyond the existence of extraterrestrial life. Even beyond the conspiracy to cover up that existence.  ",4,9
MULDER: Why all this effort to get it onto U.S. soil? I think what Alex Krycek has given us is the pivotal piece to an even larger plot.  ,4,9
MULDER: Who wants to expose the same men that we do and will go to any lengths to succeed.  ,4,9
MULDER: I'm with Scully. We're on our way out to NASA-Goddard.  ,4,9
MULDER: Explain yourself about what?  ,4,9
MULDER: Pull over here.  ,4,9
MULDER: I'm gonna take a cab.  ,4,9
MULDER: I want you to find out about that rock. Call me as soon as you do. (Gets out of car. )  ,4,9
"MULDER: We're going to walk out of here like nothing happened. If anybody speaks to us, you say nothing.  ",4,9
"MULDER (whacking Krycek's forehead): Stupid-ass haircut!  (Grabs Krycek by the front of his jacket, as if he's going to punch him)  ",4,9
MULDER: Who is he?  ,4,9
MULDER: Yeah?  ,4,9
MULDER: What is it?  ,4,9
MULDER: I think you better find out. I want you to get me an address in New York. You're going to have to go through the Bureau to get that.  ,4,9
MULDER: Fox Mulder.  ,4,9
MULDER: I need your help.  ,4,9
"MULDER: FBI database. I'm sorry, it's a matter of extreme urgency. A diplomatic pouch left Russia and arrived here in the U.S. Two men are dead. I need to know why.  ",4,9
MULDER: Krasnoyarsk?  ,4,9
MULDER: That's just north of Tunguska.  ,4,9
MULDER: Yeah.  ,4,9
"MULDER: My cell phone. I gotta book myself on a flight to Krasnoyarsk, Russia.  ",4,9
MULDER: Find my cell phone?  ,4,9
MULDER: Why? Why are you helping me?  ,4,9
MULDER: How long will it take?  ,4,9
MULDER: Making travel arrangements.  (He puts key in ignition. The car clock comes on as the engine starts; it's 3:15.)  ,4,9
MULDER: To follow the pouch.  ,4,9
MULDER: Yeah.  ,4,9
"MULDER: I'm leaving the window rolled down. If I'm not back in a week, I'll call Agent Scully to come bring you a bowl of water.  ",4,9
MULDER: What did you say to me?  ,4,9
MULDER: You called me a bad name.  ,4,9
"MULDER (smiling): You speak Russian, Krycek?  ",4,9
MULDER: Let's go. (beckons)  ,4,9
"MULDER: June 30, 1908. Tungus tribesmen and Russian fur traders look up into the southeastern Siberian sky and see a fireball streaking to Earth. When it hit the atmosphere, it created a series of cataclysmic explosions that are considered to be the largest single cosmic event in the history of civilization. Two thousand times the force of the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima.  ",4,9
"MULDER: It's been speculated that it was a piece of a comet, an asteroid, or even a piece of anti-matter. The power of the blast leveled trees in a radial pattern for 2000 kilometers. No real definitive evidence has ever been found to provide a satisfying explanation of what it was.  ",4,9
MULDER: I think somebody found that evidence. And the explanation is something that nobody ever dreamed of.  ,4,9
MULDER: Looks like some kind of mining camp.  ,4,9
MULDER: Oh!  ,4,9
MULDER:  I don't think they're miners.  ,4,9
MULDER: Run!  ,4,9
MULDER: I don't speak Russian.  ,4,9
MULDER: Told me what?  ,4,9
MULDER: I wasn't brought here.  I came here looking for something.  ,4,9
MULDER: What is this place?  ,4,9
MULDER: How do you know?  ,4,9
MULDER: To what?  ,4,9
MULDER: What did you tell them?  ,4,9
MULDER: What are you saying?  ,4,9
MULDER: Who are you?  ,4,9
MULDER: Why are you here?  ,4,9
MULDER: What kind of experiment?  ,4,9
MULDER: NO!  ,4,9
MULDER: How long have I been lying here? ,4,10
MULDER: Theyve done this to you? ,4,10
MULDER: What did they do to me. ,4,10
MULDER: Black Cancer? ,4,10
MULDER: (advancing toward a hole in the wall where the other prisoners eyes are visible) Who are you? ,4,10
MULDER: You helped them find the rock? ,4,10
MULDER: How many men have dies here? ,4,10
MULDER: Is that what they say the tests are for...to find a cure? ,4,10
"MULDER: What happened to the man who was in the cell with me, Krycek? ",4,10
MULDER: Im not going to die... ,4,10
"MULDER: I have to live long enough to kill that man, Krycek. (The prisoner passes something through the hole. Mulder examines it...it looks like a crude knife.) Where did you get this? ",4,10
MULDER: Youd rather suffer the torture? ,4,10
MULDER:  Where are we going? ,4,10
"MULDER:( draws knife from his pocket and breaks out of the line. He runs towards Alex and knocks him into the bed of the truck. He punches Krycek in the face, knocking our beloved hero unconscious. Mulder holds the guards at bay with the knife and manages to get into the cab of the truck and drive out of the yard. The prisoners cheer as Mulder drives away with Alex still lying in the truckbed. The in charge man sends guards after them on horseback. The guards shoot at them, but Mulder only drives faster. Alex slowly wakes up. He angrily pounds the glass behind Mulder's head. Sensing that he is in danger, he rolls off the truck, landing hard on his right arm. Mulder realizes too late that the brakes of the truck have given out. He is forced to crash the truck into a ditch.  ",4,10
MULDER: No Russian. ,4,10
MULDER: Tell your husband Im sorry about his truck. ,4,10
MULDER: Yeah. ,4,10
MULDER: Why dont they kill you? ,4,10
"MULDER: Well, I have to go now. ",4,10
MULDER: Theyll come looking for me. Theyll come looking for you. ,4,10
MULDER: I dont know what youre talking about. What other ways? ,4,10
MULDER: You dont understand...these tests. The smallpox scar on your arm is some kind of identification. You have to help me escape. Ill help you escape. You have to help me get to St. Petersburg. (there is a sound at the door. Mulder spins around. The driver is standing in the doorway with a large knife.)  ,4,10
MULDER: What is the question? (they all gasp and turn to see Mulder- with BOTH arms.) ,4,10
MULDER: I get to put my arms around you...both of them. ,4,10
"MULDER: Its been a long, strange trip. ",4,10
MULDER: So have I. ,4,10
MULDER: Boca Raton? ,4,10
MULDER: May we come in? ,4,10
MULDER: Scully.(Scully walks over) These people are test subjects. Theyve all been poisoned. ,4,10
MULDER: Everything thats happened....every death weve seen can be traced back to one man. ,4,10
"MULDER: Well, he isnt working alone.(They are led into a cell block). Terry Edward Mayhew. Can we talk with you...have a little off the record chat? ",4,10
MULDER: Alex Krycek. ,4,10
MULDER: The man who set you up....you and the members of your militia. ,4,10
MULDER: You came into contact with him in North Dakota salvaging materials from a missile silo. ,4,10
MULDER: What was he looking to build? ,4,10
MULDER: Did he ever mention Black Cancer. ,4,10
MULDER: Wait a second. You said there were...uh..two devices. What happened to the other bomb? ,4,10
MULDER: (looses his patience and throttles Mayhew). ,4,10
MULDER: You want to know about anarchy? You dont tell me where that other bomb is and Ill make sure you spend your prison time on your bigoted hands and knees putting a big smile on some convicts face. ,4,10
MULDER: Where? ,4,10
"MULDER: Thank You.(releases him and heads out of cell) Scully, get on the phone and get the license numbers for any two-ton trucks stolen in North Dakota in the last six months. Then call Canadian border authorities and have them stop any truck fitting that description. Tell them theyre looking for a bomb. ",4,10
"MULDER:  This has been a big setup from the beginning- almost perfectly executed. Someone used Krycek, then Krycek used us...someone who didnt want that rock in American hands. ",4,10
MULDER: Where would you put this rock if you didnt want it to be found? ,4,10
MULDER: Go back to the refinery. See if you can find anybody who knows anything about that truck. ,4,10
"MULDER: Peers into the pipe.  Sees a box, but cant reach it. Suddenly, the oil well next to him comes on, coating the ground and Mulder with oil. He is still trying to reach the box.) ",4,10
MULDER: (hears a beeping sound. The bomb is about to detonate. He runs away.  He is barely out of harms way as the bomb explodes. ,4,10
"MULDER:(interrupting) Why is this so hard to believe? When the accepted discovery of life off this planet is on the front page of every newspaper around the world? When the most conservative scientists and science journals are calling for the exploration of Mars and Jupiter? With every reason to believe that life and the persistence of it is thriving outside our own terrestrial sphere? If you cannot get past this, then I suggest this whole committee be held in contempt, for ignoring evidence that cannot be refuted. ",4,10
MULDER: Then why are we here today?!? ,4,10
"MULDER: Tres dias. Muy incredible, no?  ",4,11
"MULDER: Well, according to eyewitnesses, the death were investigating was preceded by a Fortean event. Thats a highly unusual or infrequent meteorological phenomenon also known as a transient.  ",4,11
"MULDER: Yeah. Witnesses described a bright flash about 30 degrees off the horizon, then a hot yellow rain fell from a cloudless sky. Fortean researchers call these ""liquid falls."" Black and red rains are the most common, but there have also been reported cases of blue, purple and green rains.  ",4,11
"MULDER: Yeah. Great album. Deeply flawed movie, though.  ",4,11
"MULDER: Fortean events have been linked to alien encounters, cattle mutilations, the kind of exsanguinated animal carcass you were just looking at.  ",4,11
MULDER: I would assume so.  ,4,11
"MULDER: Nobody cares, Scully. The victim and many of the witnesses are illegal immigrants. Migrant farm workers.  ",4,11
MULDER: I thought it might be important to talk to them. Before they migrated.  ,4,11
MULDER: No La Migra! No La Migra!  ,4,11
MULDER: No La Migra.  ,4,11
"MULDER: Its all right. We dont want to take anybody away. Relax. No, its okay. Tranquile.  ",4,11
MULDER: We want to know what happened to Maria Dorantes. (FLAKITA does not answer.) Does anybody know what happened to Maria Dorantes? Did anybody see anything?  ,4,11
"MULDER: (to SCULLY) Yeah, its a Mexican folktale. El Chupacabra, the goatsucker. Its a small gray creature with a big head and a small body and big black bulging eyes.  ",4,11
MULDER: (After a look to SCULLY) Did you see the Chupacabra?  ,4,11
"MULDER: Uh, how do you explain the uh, the yellow rain and the dead goat over the hill?  ",4,11
"MULDER: I doesnt make a whole lot of sense, Scully.  ",4,11
"MULDER: I admit, theres a strong suspicion of motive and intent - but the amount of detail, the description of that Chupacabra ...  ",4,11
"MULDER: Local cops dont care, Scully. I dont know who does.  ",4,11
MULDER: Find out what killed Maria Dorantes. Take a look at her body.  ,4,11
"MULDER: Try to find this man, Eladio Buente.  ",4,11
MULDER: (entering LOZANOS office holding badge) Agent Lozano? Im Special Agent Mulder. Im with the FBI.  ,4,11
MULDER: Were investigating the death of a migrant worker.  ,4,11
MULDER: Im looking for a man named Eladio Buente. He hasnt been seen for three days and hes not in police custody. I thought he might be in INS custody.  ,4,11
MULDER: So you are telling me that no one here uses their real name.  ,4,11
MULDER: Possibly the murder of a woman named Maria Dorantes.  ,4,11
MULDER: Yeah. Youve heard of it. You dont believe in it?  ,4,11
MULDER: Ive heard that.  ,4,11
MULDER: Why is he segregated like this?  ,4,11
MULDER: They think hes the Chupacabra.  ,4,11
MULDER: Ask him if he killed Maria Dorantes.  ,4,11
MULDER: What did he say?  ,4,11
MULDER: Ask him what happened.  ,4,11
MULDER: Hmm.  ,4,11
MULDER: Whats going to happen to him?  ,4,11
MULDER: There any way to delay that?  ,4,11
MULDER: Try to solve an unexplained death.  ,4,11
"MULDER: Yeah, I found him.  ",4,11
"MULDER: Not exactly, no.  ",4,11
MULDER: Flash of light ... yellow rain .. Maria! (yells) Maria!!!  ,4,11
MULDER: A fungus?  ,4,11
MULDER: And it can kill?  ,4,11
MULDER: You dont think thats weird.  ,4,11
MULDER: It still doesnt explain the flash of light and the yellow rain. And El Chupacabra.  ,4,11
MULDER: What does it look like?  ,4,11
MULDER: The same fungus that killed Maria Dorantes?  ,4,11
"MULDER: (to LOZANO, who is looking at the driver) Did you find him?  ",4,11
"MULDER: Agent Lozano, this is my partner, Agent Scully.  ",4,11
"MULDER: Im not so sure about that, Scully. (SCULLY gives him a ""what?!"" look.)  ",4,11
"MULDER: Im not questioning that, but right now Eladio Buente is the only connection we have to this death and to the death of Maria Dorantes, which is why I need you to spare any manpower you can to try to find him.  ",4,11
MULDER: Good. You should do that. While Agent Lozano and I try to find El Chupacabra.  ,4,11
MULDER: (pointing to graffiti) The storys out.  ,4,11
MULDER: So they really dont think hes the Chupacabra?  ,4,11
MULDER: Did you tell them about the fungal infection?  ,4,11
MULDER: What will become of him?  ,4,11
MULDER: Hell kill him  ,4,11
MULDER: So we got to find him first.  ,4,11
"MULDER: Well, in this case, hell curse the man who doesnt.  ",4,11
"MULDER: (voice) Hey, Scully. Where are you?  ",4,11
"MULDER: (voice) Responsible, how?  ",4,11
MULDER: (voice) Hows he spreading it?  ,4,11
"MULDER: (voice) I saw this man, Scully. He was unaffected.  ",4,11
MULDER: (on phone) Youre saying its a new strain?  ,4,11
"MULDER: Lozano, careful. (on phone) Scully, Ive been thinking. I know thats dangerous, but just bear with me. These Fortean transients that the women described? They could have been caused by an object falling at a high rate of speed through the atmosphere creating a sonic boom and a flash of light. What astronomers call a bollide.  ",4,11
MULDER: (on phone) Created by a meteorite or a piece of extraplanetary material - of which two thousand tons falls to the Earth every day. Now - now this yellow rain. Space debris could have fallen into a nearby lake superheating the water and sending it skyward. Which would mean this is alien.  ,4,11

"MULDER: Eladio! (ELADIO runs, followed by MULDER and LOZANO. To LOZANO) Dont touch him.  ",4,11
MULDER: I lost him!  ,4,11
MULDER: (disgusted) Uh!  ,4,11
MULDER: Agent Lozano! How does this man keep eluding us?  ,4,11
"MULDER: What about his brother, Soledad?  ",4,11
MULDER: Have you seen either of them?  ,4,11
MULDER: I think we should hold up a moment.  ,4,11
MULDER: Somethings going on here.  ,4,11
MULDER: Thats our man.  ,4,11
MULDER: Drop the gun!  ,4,11
MULDER: Apurate! Drop it!  ,4,11
MULDER: Hes been here.  ,4,11
MULDER: Eladio? Eladio Buente?  ,4,11
MULDER: Hows he going to get to Mexico?  ,4,11
MULDER: How are we going to find this man?  ,4,11
"MULDER: I dont know what to believe anymore, Scully. These people sure love their stories.  ",4,11
MULDER: He wont.  ,4,11
"MULDER: (having a Mulder leap of logic moment) Shes lying. If this man really thinks he killed Maria Dorantes, he wont be going to Mexico.  ",4,11
MULDER: The same place Agent Lozano and Eladios brother are going. Hes going to face his brother.  ,4,11
MULDER: God curses the man who stands between two brothers. Get on your cell phone and have a haz-mat team assembled. (Starts car.)  ,4,11
MULDER: I dont blame you.  ,4,11
"MULDER: At any rate, we arrived just after the haz-mat team ...  ",4,11
"MULDER: (voice) They established a perimeter, then secured the area. An eyewitness was found, but her testimony was questionable.  ",4,11
MULDER: (voice) Except on the body of Agent Lozano. We found him dead at the scene with a bullet wound to the chest.  ,4,11
"MULDER: (voice) Apparently, the brothers paid this man for a ride to Mexico, but they didnt get very far.  ",4,11
"MULDER: Outer space, sir.  ",4,11
"MULDER: (voice) The truth is, nobody cares.  ",4,11
"MULDER: It's an area also known for its history of racial tensions and hate crimes. Rosenbaum, Tawana Brawley..  ",4,12
MULDER: Where?  ,4,12
MULDER: Has he been arrested?  ,4,12
MULDER: Very Old Testament.  ,4,12
MULDER: Interesting how?  ,4,12
MULDER: Risen from the grave to avenge his own death?  ,4,12
MULDER: But you have your own idea.  ,4,12
MULDER: A resurrection hoax.  ,4,12
"MULDER: Yes, spectral figures are not often known to leave fingerprints. Casper never did.  ",4,12
MULDER: So there was a specific threat of violence?  ,4,12
MULDER: We would be happy not to disturb the grave site if you can tell us who that man is.  ,4,12
MULDER: Maybe...  ,4,12
"MULDER: ...but it's hard to fault his attitude when you see something like that. (He hands it to Scully.) Anybody delivering justice to a people who have known that kind of persecution and hatred, why wouldn't they protect him?  ",4,12
"MULDER: I'm not saying those kids deserve full prosecution under the law, but the hate mongering goes both ways.  ",4,12
"MULDER: I bet whoever published that knows the boys who murdered Isaac Luria. They might have a guess at who killed Tony Oliver, too.  ",4,12
MULDER: Why is that?  ,4,12
MULDER: Can you think of anyone who held a grudge?  ,4,12
MULDER: Did you?  ,4,12
"MULDER: Are you familiar with this? (He shows Bjunes the pamphlet.) We think those kids are familiar with it, enough to incite them to the murder of Isaac Luria.  ",4,12
MULDER: Who?  ,4,12
MULDER: A Jew pulled it off 2000 years ago.  ,4,12
MULDER: Bless you.  ,4,12
"MULDER: Yeah, second set of footprints, but the mud is too soft to take a mold.  ",4,12
MULDER: Looking for what?  ,4,12
"MULDER: That seems kind of redundant, doesn't it? Messing up somebody you already killed? I think they came here because they were afraid.  ",4,12
MULDER: Afraid that man they hated enough to kill wasn't really dead.  ,4,12
"MULDER: Look, there goes your theory of how Isaac's fingerprints got onto the victim's body. What's that look like to you?  ",4,12
MULDER: What's this? (He pulls out a book.) A little bedtime reading?  ,4,12
MULDER: FIRE!  ,4,12
MULDER: Have they ever been known to spontaneously combust?  ,4,12
MULDER: Is it printed on any special paper or any special ink?  ,4,12
MULDER: Is there anything that distinguishes the particular Sepher Vetzirah from any other such books?  ,4,12
MULDER: Next to your husband's grave.  ,4,12
"MULDER: What do you mean, would have meant?  ",4,12
MULDER: Yeah.  ,4,12
"MULDER: I got him, Scully.  ",4,12
"MULDER: Who killed them, Jacob?  ",4,12
MULDER: Hanging a man in self defense?  ,4,12
"MULDER: Is it any better? They found your book, your Sepher Vetzirah in Isaac's grave.  ",4,12
"MULDER: So, that puts you at a second crime scene.  ",4,12
MULDER: The truth.  ,4,12
MULDER: There was someone else in that attic with you. Who was it?  ,4,12
MULDER: Then you're a liar.  ,4,12
MULDER: He's not our killer though.  ,4,12
"MULDER: I think there was a second person in that attic, Scully. Weiss knows it too and he's protecting whoever it is.  ",4,12
MULDER: No. Somebody big enough and strong enough to knock me down.  ,4,12
"MULDER: Stick around, this could get interesting.  ",4,12
MULDER: To see a man about a burning book.  ,4,12
MULDER: There's something you didn't tell me... (Kenneth looks up. ) About the contents of this Sepher Vetzirah.  ,4,12
MULDER: I want to know about the myth of the Golem.  ,4,12
MULDER: It's the Golem that I'm interested in.  ,4,12
MULDER: That's what I was hoping you could tell me.  ,4,12
MULDER: Combinations found in that book?  ,4,12
MULDER: On the back of his hand?  ,4,12
MULDER: What's the secret word?  ,4,12
"MULDER: I don't speak Hebrew, I don't know what that means.  ",4,12
MULDER: So the Golem is an imperfect creation.  ,4,12
"MULDER: Destroyed, how?  ",4,12
MULDER: Yeah...  ,4,12
MULDER: Who?  ,4,12
"MULDER: Okay, I can be there in ten minutes.  ",4,12
MULDER: A man with a mission. Look at all the energy he spent spewing his hatred.  ,4,12
"MULDER: Well, there's no way Weiss could have killed him.  ",4,12
MULDER: I'm not so sure about that.  ,4,12
"MULDER: It's not a hoax, Scully. It never was.  ",4,12
MULDER: This is not Luria. Not really.  ,4,12
"MULDER: A ghost is spirit without form. I believe what we're looking for and what we're seeing here, is... is form without spirit. Something called a Golem.  ",4,12
MULDER: It's kind of a man made monster described in Jewish folklore. It's fashioned through mud and then animated through mystical incantation.  ,4,12
"MULDER: I don't think it was hate that created this, Scully. I think it was love.  ",4,12
"MULDER: Arial, it's Agent Mulder. Open the door.  ",4,12

I got to pay the rent. I got to eat Part of me cant help thinking this is just another way to get me out of here. But it is only a week, and youll be here to keep an eye on things for me, so... heres a few things for you to keep an eye on while Im gone. (Sorts through files)  ",4,13

In the future, Ill make sure that all those people being interviewed provide you with a multi-media laser show to keep your interest maintained. In any case his name is Sevlov Pudovkin. Hes a Russian immigrant with a doctorate in astronautical engineering. He and several other contacts worked at a military space center in the Republic of Karelia. They smuggled out reverse-engineered reports of two alien craft which crashed and were retrieved from the Sea of Barents.  ",4,13
"MULDER: At a high price, yeah.  ",4,13
"MULDER: Thats your assignment while Im gone. (SCULLY is not pleased) I want you to run an INS check and a Bureau NCIC check on these individuals. (Hands her a paper) All of whom now reside in the ""Little Russia"" section of Philadelphia. Ive also made arrangements for travel so you can administer eye-to-eye surveillance on their activities.

MULDER: (chuckles) What do you mean?  ,4,13
"MULDER: Eenie, meenie, chili beanie, the spirits are about to speak?  ",4,13
MULDER: So youre refusing an assignment based on the adventures of Moose and Squirrel?  ,4,13
"MULDER: Do what you want. Dont go to Philadelphia, But let me remind you that I worked my ass off to get the files reopened. You were just assigned. This work is my life.  ",4,13

"MULDER: Well, maybe its good that we get away from each other for a while. (Starts to leave)  ",4,13

MULDER: Pretty cozy. Whod ever want to leave.  ,4,14
"MULDER: That would be one Leonard Morris Betts, age 34. But it should probably be noted that when Mr. Betts arrived here last night he was sans head. He was decapitated when his ambulance crashed. He was an emergency medical technician for this hospital  a very good one, apparently. Slew of commendations, write-ups in the local paper.  ",4,14
"MULDER: Somebody cold-cocked him and stole his clothes. He didnt see who. No alarms tripped, no sign of a break in. Its weird, huh?  ",4,14
MULDER: Did I mention that Mr. Betts had no head?  ,4,14
MULDER: Meant to conceal what?  ,4,14
"MULDER: Yeah, but why take a headless one and leave so many top-dollar bodies behind?  ",4,14
"MULDER: Unfortunately, you cant see very much on these. What - whats all this stuff here?  ",4,14
"MULDER: Well, if this is our guy, what did he do with the corpse he stole?  ",4,14
MULDER: They combed the facility. Where could he hide an adult body where it wouldnt be found?  ,4,14
"MULDER: Well, then theres probably nothing there for us to find.  ",4,14
"MULDER: Are you sure about this, Scully? Because if youre not sure I dont see that theres any reason to disturb all this stuff, just   ",4,14
MULDER: Oh.. I think I got the toy surprise.  ,4,14
MULDER: (still disgusted) Thats his head. Wheres his body? Theres not enough room in here. Maybe he didnt dispose of the body. Maybe he got it out of here somehow.  ,4,14
MULDER: I dont know. Maybe theres an answer here. Something we should check out.  ,4,14
"MULDER: Maybe nothing, but its all weve got to go on right now. You should see if you can find a place where you can examine Betts head.  ",4,14
MULDER: Check out his house. I know how he died. I want to see how he lives.  ,4,14
MULDER: Lived.  ,4,14

MULDER: (on phone) What did you find?  ,4,14
MULDER: (on phone) Like the security footage.  ,4,14
MULDER: (on phone) What did your examination uncover?  ,4,14
MULDER: (on phone) Why not?  ,4,14
MULDER: (on phone) The head moved.  ,4,14
MULDER: (on phone) Blinked or winked?  ,4,14
"MULDER: (on phone) Youre afraid to cut into it. Scully, youre not saying that  that - that its alive, are you?  ",4,14
"MULDER: (on phone) But has it crossed your mind that that its not quite dead, either?  ",4,14
"MULDER: (on phone) Im standing here in Leonard Betts apartment. Whoever we saw in those video grabs, his clothes are strewn all over the floor. He made himself at home. Maybe he was home.  ",4,14
MULDER: (on phone) Yeah.  ,4,14
"MULDER: (on phone, embarrassed) Yeah.  ",4,14

"MULDER: No, no. Thanks for bearing with my questions. I appreciate your time. (leaves)  ",4,14
MULDER and SCULLY watch as LEONARDS head is lifted dripping from a vat of epoxy.)  ,4,14
MULDER: Or youve got yourself a nice paperweight. (MULDER laughs at his own joke.)  ,4,14
MULDER: Is something wrong with the image?  ,4,14
MULDER: He had cancer?  ,4,14
MULDER: Could you live in this condition?  ,4,14
"MULDER: Well, how do you explain it?  ",4,14
MULDER: Mmmm. Mm. Maybe were just seeing it clearly for the first time.  ,4,14
MULDER: Lets get a slice to go.  ,4,14
MULDER and SCULLY show him the slice of LEONARDS head.)  ,4,14
MULDER: Ill tell you if we find it.  ,4,14
MULDER: Chuck did some of the pioneering work in Kirilian photography in the US.  ,4,14
"MULDER: Coronal discharge, life force  the Chinese call it Chi. Its an accepted fact in most eastern cultures.  ",4,14
MULDER: It may account for the fogging of your PET scan of Leonard Betts head.  ,4,14
"MULDER: (pointing at picture for SCULLY) Chuck, would you believe that this mans head had been decapitated?  ",4,14
MULDER: Way. (to SCULLY) Are we happy with the results?  ,4,14
"MULDER: I dont know about you, Scully, but those sure as hell looked like shoulders to me.  ",4,14
"MULDER: What if it proves that Leonard Betts is alive, somehow?  ",4,14
MULDER: You said that Betts tissue was riddled with cancer. Now what is cancer but normal cells growing rapidly out of control usually caused by some damage to their DNA.  ,4,14
"MULDER: Well, let me tell you. What if there was a case where the cancer was not caused by damaged DNA  where the cancer was not a destructive or an aggressive factor, but was rather the normal state of being?  ",4,14
"MULDER: What if this mans life force  his Chi, whatever you want to call it, somehow retained a blueprint of the actual man himself? Guiding rapid growth not as cancer, but as regeneration?  ",4,14
MULDER: The fluid that I found in Betts bathtub was povidone iodine. Its often used by lab researchers on reptiles and amphibians to aid regeneration. We both know salamanders have grown entirely new limbs  regenerated.  ,4,14
"MULDER: Worms. You cut a worm in half, you get two.  ",4,14
"MULDER: Im just saying its not unheard of in nature, thats all.  ",4,14
"MULDER: Well, maybe Betts is trying to protect his secret.  ",4,14
MULDER: Who?  ,4,14
MULDER: (thinking) Huh.  ,4,14
MULDER: Scully.  ,4,14
MULDER: Do you know if your son ever used any other names for himself?  ,4,14
MULDER: When did your son die?  ,4,14
MULDER: (to SCULLY) Confused yet?  ,4,14
MULDER: (holding up the thumb bag) Siskel or Ebert? Whats the story?  ,4,14
MULDER: Why is that?  ,4,14
"MULDER: Betts was here, Scully. She must have discovered that and then he had to kill her to protect his secret.  ",4,14
MULDER: Do you know how this man escaped? He tore off his thumb because he knew he could re-grow another one.  ,4,14
MULDER: But is it unimaginable? Is Betts ability to regenerate any greater a leap forward than our ancestors ability to communicate with language or to walk upright?  ,4,14
"MULDER: Recent evolutionary theory would disagree. What scientists call ""punctualism"" or ""punctual equilibrium""  it theorizes that evolutionary advances are cataclysmic, not gradual. That evolution occurs not along a straight, graphable line, but in huge fits and starts and that the unimaginable happens in the gaps  the gap between what we are and what Leonard Betts has become.  ",4,14
"MULDER: On the other hand, how evolved can a man be who drives a Dodge Dart?  ",4,14
"MULDER: (looking a little sick) You may not want to know. Scully, theres a great possibility that Leonard Betts not only is cancer  ",4,14
MULDER: Snack food. Wouldnt it make sense that evolution or natural selection would incorporate cancer  the greatest health threat to our species as part of our genetic makeup?  ,4,14
MULDER: Ask yourself: Why is Leonard Betts an EMT? Why does he regularly visit cancer wards? Access.  ,4,14
MULDER: Do you think Mom knows her dead son is tooling around in her car?   ,4,14
MULDER and SCULLY and a group of police greet ELAINE TANNER when she opens the door.)  ,4,14
MULDER: (entering with large empty bottle of iodine) Can you tell me what you use this for? Its a pretty big bottle. Do you get a lot of cuts?  ,4,14
MULDER: Scully?  ,4,14
"MULDER: No sign of him, not even a stray sock. Just this.  ",4,14
"MULDER: Yeah, and the key on his key ring with the number 112 engraved on it.  ",4,14
MULDER: Scully.  ,4,14
MULDER: Its Betts.  ,4,14
"MULDER: I guarantee, Scully, this mans medical records will show he had lung cancer and Leonard Betts was in need of what he had.  ",4,14
MULDER: His partner said he had an ability to diagnose cancer. Maybe his need provided a heightened sense.  ,4,14
"MULDER: Yeah, for the second time.  ",4,14
MULDER: You would have said the same thing about Albert Tanner.  ,4,14
"MULDER: Six years ago. Albert Tanner dies in a car accident. His mother buries him. Several days ago, the same man shows up as Leonard Betts. Explain that to me.  ",4,14
MULDER: You want to bet on that?  ,4,14
MULDER: Will the real Leonard Betts please stand up?  ,4,14
"MULDER: I dont think so, Scully. I think that what were standing witness to here goes way beyond the regeneration of a thumb or a limb or even a new head.  ",4,14
"MULDER: Because I think that the fiery crash that killed this man was a ruse, a decoy and that this man lying here is actually still at large.  ",4,14
"MULDER: The only person connected with Betts who knows his secret is his mom. If were going to get him, itll be through her.  ",4,14
MULDER: Get out of the truck!  ,4,14
MULDER: Get out of the truck!  ,4,14
MULDER: (calling to EMTs) You guys get in here.  ,4,14
MULDER: Three guesses what was removed. He did this to her and then he called an ambulance.  ,4,14
MULDER: Betts is gone. He must have taken off on foot.  ,4,14
MULDER: You stay with her. (pulls out cell phone) Ill call local PD and have them cordon off the area.  ,4,14
MULDER: (on phone) This is Special Agent Mulder with the FBI. Ive got an emergency situation in progress. I need all available units to 3108 Old Bank Road. Im searching for a murder suspect.  ,4,14
"MULDER: (on phone) Were going house-to-house, here. Thats the only thing I can think to do. We got a chopper coming in, but until then Id say Betts has got a pretty good chance of getting away. If he steals a car or gets a ride, he could get away for good.  ",4,14
"MULDER: (on phone, voice) I mean, he obviously worked this thing out pretty well, Scully, so if theres anything you can get out of Mrs. Tanner tonight, anything at all, at this point we dont have much else to go on.  ",4,14
MULDER: (on phone) What?  ,4,14
MULDER: They pronounced Betts ten minutes ago.  ,4,14
"MULDER: As near as anyone can tell. His moms alive though, mainly due to the fact that Betts dressed her wounds so carefully. Shes going to pull through, at least for the present.  ",4,14
"MULDER: Yeah. Its uh (checks his notepad) metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma, to be precise. She was treated for it previously but got a clean bill of health about three months ago.  ",4,14
"MULDER: (gently) You did a good job, Scully. You should be proud.  ",4,14
MULDER: (in passing to nurse) Oncology? Thanks.  ,4,15
"MULDER: Scully? I uh, stole these from some guy with a broken leg down the hall. He uh, won't be able to catch me. (pause) How ya doing? ",4,15
"MULDER: What uh, what exactly are we looking at here? ",4,15
MULDER: A growth? ,4,15
MULDER: Is it operable? ,4,15
MULDER: But it's treatable. ,4,15
"MULDER: I refuse to believe that, I.. ",4,15
"MULDER: I don't accept that. Th..there must be some people who have received treatment for this, we..can.... ",4,15
MULDER: I understand. I assume you'll be taking a leave of absence. ,4,15
"MULDER: Last year agent Scully and I pursued a case in which a number of women, proported abductees, experienced similar symptoms after having implants removed from the base of their necks. A woman in Allentown, Pennsylvania, named Betsy Higopian was undergoing treatment for nasopharengeal tumor. We just haven't been able to contact her yet. ",4,15
"MULDER: No, we're with the FBI. ",4,15
MULDER: Betsy was part of a MUFON group? ,4,15
"MULDER: Would mind if we come inside and take a look? (shows badge, woman stands aside, they enter, Scully has a flashback of the women she met last year, then touches the back of her neck) ",4,15
MULDER: Hey Scully listen to this. (static in phone) There's two lines coming into this house. This one was lit. ,4,15
MULDER: Ya but who and for what? ,4,15
MULDER: Someone must have remote access to the system. ,4,15
MULDER: Copying files. Let's get a trace on this before whoever it is hangs up. (Scully dials phone)  ,4,15
"MULDER: I'm going to check around back. Why don't you see if you can get the manager. (Mulder going behind building, walks up back stairs, man comes out of a door and tries to escape towards the front, Scully points gun towards him) ",4,15
MULDER: Scully.. ,4,15
MULDER: (through door) You ok in there Scully? (Scully in bathroom) ,4,15
"MULDER: He says he's a member of the same Mutual UFO Network group that Betsy Higopian belonged to, that he was downloading files for safe keeping as Betsy had instructed him to. ",4,15
"MULDER: He thinks his life's in danger, he thinks there's a government conspiracy to suppress the information gathered in those files. ",4,15
MULDER: Well he seems to know an awful lot about Betsy and the other women in the MUFON group you met in his house. ,4,15
MULDER: We can't. ,4,15
MULDER: I want you to listen to me. ,4,15
"MULDER: About what you won't to admit to yourself, what you're denying. ",4,15
MULDER: Where your cancer came from. ,4,15
"MULDER: It does matter, if what you have is a result of your abduction and that abduction is something the government knows about then those are facts that should be brought to light. ",4,15
MULDER: But these women are dead. ,4,15
MULDER: If you won't listen to me then I think you should go talk to her. ,4,15
MULDER: If that's too hard for you then I think you should call an investigator. You have one remaining witness Agent Scully. I'd think you'd want to know what her story is.  ,4,15
MULDER: Mulder. ,4,15
MULDER: Where are you Scully? ,4,15
"MULDER: I'm at Betsy Higopian's going through some of those hard files before stuff starts disappearing, and call me an early bird but I think I've found something. Now some of these women who have died, they're childless, and they've been treated for infertility at the clinic about 30 miles from here. Penny Northern and Betsy Higopian are among them. ",4,15
"MULDER: I've made some phone calls and I've tried to get some information but nobody is talking to me, so.. ",4,15
"MULDER: Why, did you find something there? ",4,15
MULDER: Is there something I should know? ,4,15
MULDER: I will be right there. (both hang up)  ,4,15
"MULDER: I've got a gun pointed at your head. Turn around very slowly. Kurt Crawford, we seem to be traveling in the same circles these days. ",4,15
"MULDER: You disappeared with those files from Betsy Hagopian's, I called you at least half a dozen times. I got to thinking you're a liar, now tell me I'm wrong. ",4,15
MULDER: You think you can get access from here? ,4,15
MULDER: Vegreville. (Kurt types it) ,4,15
MULDER: I need you to set up a meeting for me. ,4,15
MULDER: She's at a hospital in Allentown beginning treatment. ,4,15
"MULDER: They've taken a turn. A pretty big U-turn by the looks of it. (pulls out disk) This is a file directory from a federally operated fertility clinic. Agent Scully's name is on this file, although I'm pretty sure, pretty damn sure she's never undergone treatment for infertility. ",4,15
MULDER: I don't know. It's just a directory for a mainframe housed in the Lumbard Research Facility. ,4,15
MULDER: Cigarette man. (pause) I have no doubt in my mind he's behind this. ,4,15
"MULDER: Ya well this is different, this is different, I'm willing to deal now. ",4,15
"MULDER: No, no I need that meeting. ",4,15
MULDER: (heated) He knows what they did to Agent Scully. He may very well know how to save her. ,4,15
MULDER: We are talking about Agent Scully's life. ,4,15
MULDER: How'd you guys get in? ,4,15
MULDER: What do you mean? ,4,15
MULDER: Does it tell us anything at all? ,4,15
MULDER: Why store something like this and why keep it a secret? ,4,15
MULDER: Or a cure. ,4,15
MULDER: You guys ever been to the Lumbard Research Facility? (pause) Well pick out something black and sexy and prepare to do some funky poaching.  ,4,15
MULDER: We gots to go. (Byers and Mulder get out of car) ,4,15
MULDER: You guys couldn't spring for 2 of these? (pulls mic off Byers's ear) Langly what the hell is going on? ,4,15
MULDER: Boys we have a problem. The doctor that's treating Scully's cancer's on staff here. ,4,15
MULDER: (to Byers) Look I need someone to get to Scully to get her to stop treatment. Right now you're the only one who can do that.  ,4,15
MULDER: Langly where the hell am I going? ,4,15
"MULDER: Langly can you hear me? (static) Langley I can't hear you. (Mulder in front of a door) Open the door. Open the damn door! (Door opens, Mulder sees multiple individuals identical to Kurt Crawford) ",4,15
MULDER: You're hybrids. ,4,15
MULDER: You've been using me. ,4,15
MULDER: What objective? ,4,15
MULDER: (rubs condensation off on of the tanks) I've seen this boy before. These boys were you. ,4,15
MULDER: And you want to destroy them? ,4,15
MULDER: What are these? ,4,15
MULDER: Taken from whom? (they see a drawer with Scully's name on it) ,4,15
MULDER: (whispered) What? (opens drawer to reveal vials) ,4,15
MULDER: Why? ,4,15
"MULDER: For genetic hybridization, or reproduction. These women, these women are your birth mothers. ",4,15
MULDER: You're trying to save them. ,4,15
MULDER: Langly I can't hear you. ,4,15
MULDER: You sure it's not Byers? ,4,15
"MULDER: Langley help me out here, I don't know where I'm going. ",4,15
"MULDER: 'K Langly, Frohike I'm here open the door. ",4,15
MULDER: Work faster. Langly open the door now! (Multiple shots) Get me outta here! Get me outta here now! ,4,15
"MULDER: Nurse, nurse! Dana Scully is supposed to be in her room, where is she? ",4,15
MULDER: No what happened to her? ,4,15
MULDER: Well who the hell does know? ,4,15
MULDER: What happened to Scully? ,4,15
"MULDER: Where is she now? (Byers opens door to reveal Scully at by Penny's bedside, Scully and Mulder look at each other, Scully turns back to Penny) ",4,15
"MULDER: (stands) She gone? (Scully nods yes, she is upset) ",4,15
"MULDER: I'm sorry. I know what she meant to you. (pause) When I came to find you, you weren't in your room I got scared that something had happened..and I read some of what you wrote. (S sighs, walks closer to Mulder) ",4,15
MULDER: Byers tell you about Dr. Scanlon? ,4,15
MULDER: He may very well have killed those women. ,4,15
"MULDER: When we find him. Scully something was done to you, something that you're just beginning to remember. You can't quite figure it out but it can be explained and it will be explained. And no matter what you think as a scientist or a doctor, there is a way, and you will find it, to save yourself. ",4,15
"MULDER: Come on back. (pause) The truth will save you Scully. I think it'll save both of us. (Mulder kisses Scully on the forehead, Scully exits down the hall, Mulder takes vial of Scully's ova out of pocket and looks at it thoughtfully)  ",4,15
MULDER: I was leaving you a voice mail. It's 5:30 what are y.. ,4,15
MULDER: I want you to know that Scully's doing ok. She says she's coming back to work actually. ,4,15
"MULDER: I was calling to thank you for your advice about your chainsmoking friend. I think you were right. We have to know what he knows, we just have to find another way. ",4,15
MULDER: He's here. I feel him.  ,4,16
"MULDER: Don't take your eyes off him, Scully.  ",4,16
MULDER: Not yet. (he sees the man in the crowd) I got him. (he keeps his eyes on the same place but now doesn't see him) I lost him.  ,4,16
MULDER: (drawing his weapon) He's got a gun!  ,4,16
MULDER: I can't see him. I can't see him.  ,4,16
"MULDER: What if Private Burkholder's telling the truth, that he's innocent?  ",4,16
MULDER: You mean there's no procedure outlined for an invisible assasin?  ,4,16
MULDER: He passed.  ,4,16
"MULDER: Yeah. I found his story compelling, personally, but then again I believe the Warren Commission.  ",4,16
MULDER: Mr. Markham?  ,4,16
"MULDER: It's extremely urgent that we talk to you right now, sir.  ",4,16
MULDER: There goes the neighborhood.  ,4,16
"MULDER: What's your ""word"" on this?  ",4,16
MULDER: I'd like to ask you that.  ,4,16
MULDER: He told me to pull this photo from his file cabinet.  ,4,16
MULDER: He says that's who killed General MacDougal.  ,4,16
MULDER: Left for dead?  ,4,16
MULDER: When was this photo taken?  ,4,16
"MULDER: Well, what if he's telling the truth?  ",4,16
"MULDER: Maybe the war ain't over, Scully.  ",4,16
"MULDER: Well, given the facts of the case and Private Burkholder's polygraph test, this is the closest thing to an explanation that we've got.  ",4,16
"MULDER: (nodding and smiling) Well, there is that possibility, too.  ",4,16
MULDER: What if he passes?  ,4,16
"MULDER: Yeah, and more copies to distribute.  ",4,16
MULDER: I thought she ID'd Teager?  ,4,16
MULDER: Because his name's on the wall?  ,4,16
MULDER: They have his remains?  ,4,16
MULDER: Why go to all that trouble?  ,4,16
MULDER: You say he just disappeared?  ,4,16
MULDER: Scully?  ,4,16
MULDER: Can we give Mrs. Davenport an eye exam?  ,4,16
"MULDER: By all accounts, the man we're looking for - the man she saw - has a knack for vanishing in plain sight. Maybe there's a connection.  ",4,16
MULDER: And how did she reach that emotional state?  ,4,16
MULDER: I'm gonna see if we're really chasing a dead man.  ,4,16
MULDER: Yes.  ,4,16
MULDER: This was all that was left of Teager at the crash site?  ,4,16
MULDER: Is there any way to tell how the teeth were extracted?  ,4,16
MULDER: (looking through the microscope) Can you tell if that was pre- or post-mortem?  ,4,16
"MULDER: Well then this is presumptive, isn't it? A finding of death based on inconclusive evidence?  ",4,16
"MULDER: Whoever signed off on this death chose to ignore the facts, huh?  ",4,16
MULDER: Is there any other way to tell?  ,4,16
"MULDER: General Steffan, this is Special Agent Fox Mulder with the FBI. I'm calling because we have reason to believe that your life may be in danger.  ",4,16
MULDER: That the person or persons responsible for the murder of General MacDougal this morning may have chosen to target you.  ,4,16
MULDER: Based on a death certificate that you may have put your signature on. A death certificate for Sgt. Nathaniel Teager.  ,4,16
"MULDER: Listen, sir, I'm ten minutes away. I gonna have to ask you to trust my risk assessment on this and take every caution.  ",4,16
"MULDER: OK, do you know your driver, sir?  ",4,16
"MULDER: Good. I'm gonna put two FBI agents there to escort you just as a precaution. They have my mobile phone number, OK?  ",4,16
MULDER: (to phone) Mulder.  ,4,16
MULDER: Did you find out what caused her eye to hemorrhage?  ,4,16
MULDER: Scotoma?  ,4,16
"MULDER: Well, what would cause that?  ",4,16
"MULDER: Well, don't you think it's odd, Scully, that she'd have a blind spot that she wouldn't, uh, that she wouldn't have noticed before? (to security guard) Thanks.  ",4,16
"MULDER: Well, that might account for Teager's vanishing.  ",4,16
"MULDER: Oh, hold on second, Scully. (he hits a button to switch to the other call) It's Mulder.  ",4,16
MULDER: Where are you?  ,4,16
MULDER: All right. The agents that I assigned to you - are they with you?  ,4,16
"MULDER: I want you to call them into your office right now, General.  ",4,16
"MULDER: Listen to me very carefully, OK? I'm on my way over there.  ",4,16
MULDER: General Steffan? General Steffan?  ,4,16
MULDER: Call an ambulance.  ,4,16
MULDER: The general's secretary had been in here organizing his desk no more than fifteen minutes before the general was shot. He never saw this card (shows it to her) and he never saw anyone go in and out of the office aside from the general and the agents assigned to him.  ,4,16
MULDER: I was on the phone with the man. He was shot at close range in the forehead. I think he would have seen the shooter.  ,4,16
MULDER: No scotoma?  ,4,16
"MULDER: I think it's beyond all our capabilities, but somebody's got to explain how a four-star general could be shot and killed in what is symbolically the best guarded military base in the country.  ",4,16
MULDER: That's him. That's Teager.  ,4,16
MULDER: I did everything I could. I put two agents with him ...  ,4,16
"MULDER: That's correct, sir.  ",4,16
MULDER: I think that Teager has an ability - the ability to effectively erase himself from the visual field.  ,4,16
"MULDER: I think he can hide himself from human sight by manipulating something that Scully has referred to as naturally occurring, a blind spot.  ",4,16
"MULDER: You might not be able to see him. Isn't it true that American soldiers have reported the unexplained appearance and disappearance of V.C. guerrillas? I've read the dispatches myself. I mean, maybe Teager learned something from his captors in 25 years of isolation.  ",4,16
"MULDER: Parade or no parade, those men are gonna be vulnerable. The only way to stop this killer is to catch him.  ",4,16
MULDER: By finding his next victim before he does.  ,4,16
MULDER: Cross-town traffic's all snarled up because of the parade.  ,4,16
MULDER: A man named Teager.  ,4,16
MULDER: Then why did you come here?  ,4,16
MULDER: A POW named Teager may be back home carrying out death sentences against the men that left him in Vietnam.  ,4,16
MULDER: Generals - Steffan and MacDougal.  ,4,16
MULDER: What is that?  ,4,16
MULDER: Men employed by our government as spies and commandos and then left behind enemy lines to certain capture and death. The operation was disavowed and their lives were erased from the records.  ,4,16
MULDER: Are you saying that our government wants these officers dead? Why would they ask us to protect them?  ,4,16
"MULDER: (following her) Well, who's the third man? I need a name.  ",4,16
MULDER: Scully. I heard what happened. They told me you saved General Bloch's life.  ,4,16
MULDER: They told me you saw somebody on the parade route.  ,4,16
"MULDER: You saw him, didn't you? You saw Teager.  ",4,16
"MULDER: Yeah, but you drew your gun, Scully. You must have been a little more convinced than that.  ",4,16
MULDER: I found out about General Bloch from the same person who told me that we were never meant to save Bloch's life ... or the other generals.  ,4,16
"MULDER: This case - why do you think it was dumped in your lap, unless heading up an anti-terrorism detail is all of a sudden part of your job description.  ",4,16
"MULDER: Well, they knew about Teager. They'd known that he'd be unstoppable from the beginning.  ",4,16
"MULDER: And us. Given the nature of the case, they knew that you'd bring us in.  ",4,16
MULDER: Discrediting us in this case is only secondary.  ,4,16
"MULDER: To maintaining their secret policy of denial about POW's, which required silencing the men who made that policy.  ",4,16
"MULDER: No, no, Denny Markham may be the only man in this case who's telling the truth. But if you don't believe me, why don't you ask General Bloch himself.  ",4,16
MULDER: He won't reconsider. (Bloch stops and turns back to them) Not going out there would be an admission of guilt.  ,4,16
"MULDER: Don't take your eyes off him, Scully.  ",4,16
MULDER: Not yet. (he sees him standing in the crowd) I got him. (then he doesn't see him) I lost him.  ,4,16
MULDER: He's got a gun.  ,4,16
MULDER: I can't see him.  ,4,16
MULDER: Teager's here. I saw him out of the corner of my eye.  ,4,16
MULDER: Where's General Bloch?  ,4,16
MULDER: We've got to stop him.  ,4,16
MULDER: He can only hide himself in somebody's direct line of sight.  ,4,16
MULDER: That's why he killed General MacDougal and Steffan at close quarters - MacDougal in his car and Steffan in his office.  ,4,16
MULDER: Get away from the car! He's in the car! Teager's in the car!  ,4,16
"MULDER: Get out of the car with your hands in the air! It's over, Teager. Come on out.  ",4,16
MULDER: The Pentagon is claiming that the man who was killed was a Thomas Lynch. He's a vet who's been in and out of VA psychiatric hospitals for the last 15 years.  ,4,16
MULDER: They must have gotten to him.  ,4,16
"MULDER: You heard him! We both did! It's happening all over again. They're covering the lies with more lies, trying to make him invisible. We've got to subpoena Markham and General Bloch, and we've got to petition the State Department to release Teager's body ...  ",4,16
MULDER: Why not?  ,4,16
MULDER: Don't let them do this.  ,4,16
MULDER: So did Nathaniel Teager.  ,4,16
"MULDER: Is that what you believe? Is that what you really believe? They're not just denying this man's life, they're denying his death. (he moves closer to Skinner) And with all due respect, Sir ... he could be you.  ",4,16
MULDER: Special Agent Dana Katherine Scully...  ,4,17
"MULDER: I didn't know it was your birthday, Scully.  ",4,17
MULDER: That's the way I like to celebrate them...  ,4,17
"MULDER: You're welcome. Oh, I got something for you.  ",4,17
MULDER: It's just something that reminded me of you.  ,4,17
"MULDER: Two, actually. I made them into earrings.  ",4,17
MULDER: Read the back.  ,4,17
"MULDER: It's, um...  ",4,17
MULDER: About what?  ,4,17
"MULDER: Excuse me, sir. I'm Special Agent Mulder with the F.B.I.  ",4,17
"MULDER: Uh, you can clearly here the pilot say ""intercept"" on the recording.  ",4,17
"MULDER: No, no, but there was a passenger on that plane who was, uh, well-known to our government as an alien abductee.  ",4,17
"MULDER: Yeah, a man named Max Fenig, a multiple abduction victim, what's known as a repeater.  ",4,17
"MULDER: He'd predicted the accident, and from the sound of the tape, the plane may have been forced down.  ",4,17
MULDER: I'm hesitant to speculate.  ,4,17
"MULDER: Yes, sir.  ",4,17
"MULDER: Fenig, and there may be people who want to cover up this evidence.  ",4,17
"MULDER: No, sir.  ",4,17
"MULDER: I think we all share the same goal here, sir, and that's to find out what caused that plane to crash.  ",4,17
MULDER: Where's the plane?  ,4,17
MULDER: But not to Max Fenig.  ,4,17
"MULDER: No, he was on this flight, Scully, I'm sure of that.  ",4,17
MULDER: I don't know... but maybe that one man's life was worth sacrificing a hundred-and-thirty-three others.  ,4,17
MULDER: Is that a hand?  ,4,17
MULDER: What does it read?  ,4,17
MULDER: So does this one. What are they listing as the time of the crash?  ,4,17
MULDER: That's nine minutes difference.  ,4,17
"MULDER: Nine minutes, Scully. Do you remember the last time you were missing nine minutes?  ",4,17
"MULDER: Yeah, something just occurred to me.  ",4,17
MULDER: I don't think we're going to find Max Fenig after all.  ,4,17
"MULDER: Yeah, but I'm beginning to doubt whether he finished this flight with the rest of the passengers.  ",4,17
MULDER: This man's name was Larold Rebhun.  ,4,17
MULDER: You think Max was carrying plutonium?  ,4,17
MULDER: What would Max be doing with that?  ,4,17
MULDER: So... what caused this crash?  ,4,17
"MULDER: You want to know what I think, Scully?  ",4,17
"MULDER: And all the evidence will point to this conclusion but it will be dismissed because of it's improbability, it's unthinkability.  ",4,17
"MULDER: The crash of Flight five-forty-nine will go unsolved unless we find a way to prove it. And when Max is returned, he's going to tell us exactly the same story unless someone gets to him first.  ",4,17
MULDER: You're positive of this?  ,4,17
MULDER: There's still no explanation for this crash.  ,4,17
MULDER: And?  ,4,17
"MULDER: In other words, there's still no explanation for what brought this plane down.  ",4,17
"MULDER: They're not able to, or they're not willing to?  ",4,17
"MULDER: Because there are no facts, Scully. What they're telling you, what they're going to report, they're the opposite of the facts. A claim to ignorance of the facts. Claimed steadfastly, ignorance becomes as acceptable as the truth.  ",4,17
MULDER: That there is not one wristwatch on any of those bagged bodies. All of the wristwatches have been stolen.  ,4,17
"MULDER: These men, no. These men are trained to identify moving parts. Hydraulics, electronics. They're trained to reconstruct those parts and the past and arrive at the present. But they can't do that because somebody has stolen the past from them. Nine minutes of it. Nine minutes that became a lifetime for those passengers, and now for their families. Someone has got to figure out what happened in those nine minutes. Somehow, we've got to get them back.  ",4,17
MULDER: Louis Frish?  ,4,17
MULDER: I'm Agent Mulder.  ,4,17
MULDER: Were you in the tower that night?  ,4,17
MULDER: Did Flight five-forty-nine show up on your radar?  ,4,17
MULDER: Did you establish radio contact with them?  ,4,17
MULDER: Would there be a record of five-forty-nine on your log?  ,4,17
MULDER: What was their response?  ,4,17
MULDER: About nine minutes.  ,4,17
MULDER: Wasn't the initial report that there was no radar confirmation of the crash?  ,4,17
MULDER: Sharon Graffia?  ,4,17
MULDER: Yeah.  ,4,17
MULDER: Does your policy cover the acts of extraterrestrials?  ,4,17
"MULDER: Okay, Scully, hit me with your best shot. What do you think happened here?  ",4,17
MULDER: It looks an awful lot to me like this place fell from twenty-nine thousand feet.  ,4,17
"MULDER: Was abducted, just like Max. Maybe it runs in the family.  ",4,17
MULDER: You're the experts. Why don't you bring your team down here and work it out?  ,4,17
"MULDER: Yeah, coming up with all that inconclusive evidence.  ",4,17
MULDER: Why not?  ,4,17
MULDER: Then what caused that?  ,4,17
MULDER: But it did.  ,4,17
"MULDER: Hey, Scully, it's me. I, I just realized something. The, the voice of the air-traffic controller, I've heard it before.  ",4,17
"MULDER: No, I know, I know, I know, I know, I just need you to come over and listen to this right now, okay?  ",4,17
"MULDER: There seems to be more than a little discrepancy. What you've been told, what you've been led to believe, was built upon a lie that Sergeant Frish was asked to perpetuate, along with Sergeant Gonzales, who is now dead.  ",4,17
MULDER: And so do we.  ,4,17
MULDER: The military is working to cover up that evidence.  ,4,17
"MULDER: Unless the aircraft that was fired on never appeared on his radar screen. A third, unidentified aircraft that engaged the civilian jet which the sergeant never saw.  ",4,17
"MULDER: Shot down by the intercept aircraft, which, in turn, may have caused the crash of Flight five-forty-nine, which means that the cause of this crash is not here in this hangar, but is out there somewhere at a second crash site.  ",4,17
"MULDER: No, they didn't know to look for that. They didn't know about a second aircraft, except the military. Which means that this man's life is in danger because he can put the pieces together.  ",4,17
MULDER: Hold on.  ,4,17
"MULDER: Louis, help me out.  ",4,17
MULDER: Is he going to see us?  ,4,17
MULDER: We're not going to make it.  ,4,17
MULDER: Scully! Louis! I want to ask you something.  ,4,17
"MULDER: What if that's because there is no second crash site, because that second aircraft never fell to the ground?  ",4,17
MULDER: Yeah.  ,4,17
MULDER: Possible?  ,4,17
MULDER: Yeah.  ,4,17
MULDER: As soon as I know.  ,4,17
MULDER: I stopped by your place. Nobody was home.  ,4,17
MULDER: Fox Mulder. I'm with the F.B.I.  ,4,17
MULDER: What's going on out there?  ,4,17
MULDER: Where?  ,4,17
MULDER: Can you show me?  ,4,17
MULDER: Over there.  ,4,17
MULDER: Not exactly.  ,4,17
"MULDER: Once, I, uh... I got a quarter off of the deep end at the ""Y"" pool.  ",4,17
"MULDER: Hey, Scully. You come to spring me from the joint?  ",4,18
MULDER: About what? The big old misunderstanding?  ,4,18
"MULDER: So all of a sudden, they just decide to take responsibility for the crash of Flight five-forty-nine?  ",4,18
"MULDER: The facts? Have you heard their cover story? That the control tower gave bad coordinates to a fighter pilot, causing him to collide with Flight five-forty-nine over military airspace?  ",4,18
MULDER: So they're saying the tower put those jets on a collision course.  ,4,18
"MULDER: And realizing his guilt, Sergeant Frish's fellow officer put a gun to his head.  ",4,18
MULDER: Then they could conveniently lay the blame on a dead man.  ,4,18
"MULDER: This, uh... second plane... they say it's a military fighter?  ",4,18
"MULDER: You believe that story, Scully?  ",4,18
MULDER: You believe I got this from an F-Fifteen Eagle?  ,4,18
"MULDER: At the second crash site, in about fifty feet of water at the bottom of Sacandaga Lake.  ",4,18
"MULDER: Mm-hmm. I followed a trail of bubbles down to the wreckage, but it didn't look like anything that might take off from an Air Force base.  ",4,18
"MULDER: What collided with Flight five-forty-nine was a UFO shot down by the military, taking the passenger plane right along with it.  ",4,18
MULDER: Why not?  ,4,18
MULDER: According to who?  ,4,18
MULDER: How do you know he's not lying?  ,4,18
MULDER: What information?  ,4,18
MULDER: Max Fenig's sister?  ,4,18
"MULDER: Well, who is she?  ",4,18
MULDER: Why would she lie?  ,4,18
"MULDER: H, how?  ",4,18
"MULDER: Wait, Scully, Scully.  ",4,18
"MULDER: It's got to be for the truth. If we owe them anything, it's to make sure of that.  ",4,18
"MULDER: Excuse me, sir, Max Fenig?  ",4,18
MULDER: Thanks.  ,4,18
"MULDER: You have to admit, the man had an enduring sense of style.  ",4,18
MULDER: What do you mean?  ,4,18
"MULDER: Hmmm, beans and weinies.  ",4,18
MULDER: Something to explain what Max was doing on that plane... what he was coming to show me or tell me.  ,4,18
"MULDER: Max is the key to all this. He knew that plane was in danger even before it took off, before it entered military airspace.  ",4,18
MULDER: You had something you wanted to tell us?  ,4,18
"MULDER: I think the facts are still a matter of speculation, Mister Millar, and listening to what you just said, I think you do, too.  ",4,18
"MULDER: Agent Scully and I agree on some of the motives, but not exactly on the facts.  ",4,18
"MULDER: No, but I do have a story if you're willing to hear it. Feel free to tell me it's bull, as Agent Scully has...  ",4,18
"MULDER: There was one man who knew what brought this plane down, and he knew it even before he got on the plane, but he got on anyway.  ",4,18
MULDER: Physical proof of the existence of extraterrestrial life and intelligence.  ,4,18
MULDER: Max Fenig knew immediately what this craft was and that he would not be completing the rest of the flight as scheduled.  ,4,18
"MULDER: A third aircraft, probably an F-Fifteen Eagle, was given the coordinates to Flight five-forty-nine.  ",4,18
MULDER: The flight controllers watched the fighter enter Flight five-forty-nine's airspace on an intercept pattern...  ,4,18
"MULDER: If not for factors unforeseen, I believe Max Fenig would have been abducted and returned to Flight five-forty-nine without any loss of life, without a trace.  ",4,18
MULDER: Flight five-forty-nine and the alien craft which has taken control of it were intercept by the military fighter which had been given a specific set of orders... take down the UFO.  ,4,18
"MULDER: That's the Hollywood term, but yes.  ",4,18
MULDER: Yes.  ,4,18
MULDER: Not without the object that Max Fenig was carrying.  ,4,18
MULDER: That's it?  ,4,18
"MULDER: Yeah, I know.  ",4,18
"MULDER: And we may never know who killed Agent Pendrell. And if we don't find out, what meaning did their deaths have? Or their lives? I mean, Max'll be remembered as a...  ",4,18
MULDER: How about Sharon Graffia?  ,4,18
"MULDER: Yeah, but she knew Max well enough for him to write her thousands of letters, well enough for him to call her and tell her he was going to die. Do you know where she is?  ",4,18
"MULDER: I'd, I'd go with you, but I'm, I'm afraid they'd lock me up.  ",4,18
"MULDER: No. My name is, uh, Mulder. I'm with the F.B.I.  ",4,18
"MULDER: No, why?  ",4,18
MULDER: Any idea who did this?  ,4,18
"MULDER: No, Max is dead. He, he died in a plane crash a few days ago.  ",4,18
"MULDER: Uh, did, did he ever mention why he would leave or where he would go?  ",4,18
"MULDER: Yeah, I'm... yeah, I'm sure.  ",4,18
"MULDER: Oh, he has mail?  ",4,18
MULDER: Please.  ,4,18
MULDER: So do I.  ,4,18
MULDER: I left a bag here.  ,4,18
"MULDER: Short bag, tall bag.  ",4,18
MULDER: I'm a federal officer. I need a security entrance to the terminal.  ,4,18
MULDER: Mulder.  ,4,18
"MULDER: I'm at the airport in Syracuse, New York. Whatever is it that Max had, I have it now.  ",4,18
MULDER: Luck.  ,4,18
"MULDER: Well, what is it?  ",4,18
"MULDER: Well, I'm going to let you know in a minute.  ",4,18
MULDER: What's that? I'm having trouble hearing you on the phone here.  ,4,18
"MULDER: No, hold on a second, I'm going to tell you what it looks like.  ",4,18
MULDER: Hold on a second.  ,4,18
"MULDER: It looks like a small superstructure with three circular pieces inside. It's hard to tell on an x-ray, hold on.  ",4,18
"MULDER: More people are trying to get their hands on this thing than a ""Tickle-Me Elmo"" doll. I'm getting on a flight.  ",4,18
MULDER: I think it's five-oh-one.  ,4,18
MULDER: Thanks.  ,4,18
MULDER: Thanks.  ,4,18
"MULDER: No, go ahead.  ",4,18
MULDER: It's all right.  ,4,18
"MULDER: There's a weapon pointed at you right now. If I shoot you at this range, it wouldn't just hit you in the leg. If you so much as raise your arms off that armrest, I'm going to test that theory.  ",4,18
MULDER: I won't.  ,4,18
MULDER: A pretty lady comes around with honey-roasted peanuts?  ,4,18
MULDER: What if the pilot can't get control of the plane? Then you die too.  ,4,18
MULDER: I'm sure all the other passengers on this plane would appreciate dying for your noble philosophy.  ,4,18
MULDER: What is this?  ,4,18
"MULDER: It's an alien energy source, isn't it? What is it, cold fusion? Over-unity energy? What could be worth killing all those passengers on Flight five-forty-nine?  ",4,18
MULDER: I'm going to see you pay for that error... along with you and your employer and the government that finances its contracts. I want you to stand up very slowly and move to the back of the plane. We're going to go to the bathroom.  ,4,18
"MULDER: Hey, Scully, it's me.  ",4,18
MULDER: I'm standing outside an airplane bathroom where I've got the man who shot Pendrell locked up.  ,4,18
"MULDER: Yeah, and it looks like I'm going to miss the in-flight movie. Something starring Steve Guttenberg.  ",4,18
"MULDER: Uh, yeah.  ",4,18
"MULDER: Hey, Scully.  ",4,18
MULDER: My watch just stopped.  ,4,18
MULDER: Excuse me.  ,4,18
"MULDER: Intercepted, engaged and boarded. I want you to tell the captain to initiate evasive maneuvers immediately.  ",4,18
MULDER: Drop the bag! Drop the bag! Drop it!  ,4,18
MULDER: He's not here.  ,4,18
MULDER: What time do you have?  ,4,18
MULDER: I think he got the connecting flight.  ,4,18
"MULDER: No, I think you, you should consider yourself the sole curator of the Max Fenig Rolling Multimedia Library and Archive, and you should probably get tax-exempt status as soon as you can. This stuff could be worth something someday.  ",4,18
MULDER: You thinking about Pendrell?  ,4,18
MULDER: I just thought it was a pretty cool keychain.  ,4,18
"MULDER: His name was Lucas Menand, a post-doctoral fellow at MIT. He was a bright and promising researcher, a life dedicated to science cut short by an unfortunate bus accident.  ",4,19
"MULDER: He claims that Menand was pushed, by a suspect identified as Jason Nichols (he hands Scully a police photo of Jason), an associate professor of biology as well as Menand's academic advisor.  ",4,19
"MULDER: Hmmm ... sounds like a motive, doesn't it?  ",4,19
MULDER: Would you like to hear his alibi?  ,4,19
"MULDER: Well, he goes on to tell a pretty convincing narrative and to give a rather detailed description of the old man.  ",4,19
"MULDER: Well, not when campus security picked him up.  ",4,19
"MULDER: Minutes before the accident, according to Jason Nichols. Packed into a security vehicle, trying to warn Nichols even as he was being hauled away.  ",4,19
MULDER: No.  ,4,19
MULDER: Can't.  ,4,19
MULDER: He's dead.  ,4,19
MULDER: Have you ever seen a body in such an advanced hypothermic state?  ,4,19
MULDER: Where was he found?  ,4,19
MULDER: You mean he's actually getting colder.  ,4,19
"MULDER: So what's your medical opinion, Scully?  ",4,19
"MULDER: Well, you see what happens when you drink and drive?  ",4,19
MULDER: Maybe we should ask Jason Nichols if he can explain this.  ,4,19
MULDER: We'll just hope that he keeps until Thanksgiving.  ,4,19
MULDER: Yeah. Special Agent Mulder. (they shake hands) Is that your girlfriend?  ,4,19
"MULDER: Thanks for seeing me. I know your attorney advised you against it, so I appreciate it.  ",4,19
"MULDER: Yeah, people out there looking for him.  ",4,19
MULDER: I'm sure you know that the man who allegedly detained the man you described is now dead.  ,4,19
"MULDER: Well, not unless, uh, you're capable of killing a man by flash freezing him.  ",4,19
MULDER: The security officer who's now in the morgue has a body temperature a little south of Frosty the Snow Man.  ,4,19
MULDER: Do I think what's funny?  ,4,19
MULDER: Does this have something to do with you and Lucas Menand?  ,4,19
MULDER: He threatened your life?  ,4,19
MULDER: How'd he do that?  ,4,19
MULDER: Had you?  ,4,19
MULDER: Was Lucas Menand up for the same grant?  ,4,19
MULDER: And what research would this grant have funded?  ,4,19
MULDER: Oh! Excuse me. (he steps outside) (to phone) Mulder.  ,4,19
"MULDER: No, I'm right in the middle of it.  ",4,19
MULDER: Security officer?  ,4,19
MULDER: I just spoke with the bellman who brought up the luggage.  ,4,19
MULDER: The iceman cometh. Dr. Yonechi was accompanied by a man in his seventies. It's a description confirmed by the desk clerk. They're working with a composite artist on a sketch right now.  ,4,19
MULDER: It sounds like that.  ,4,19
"MULDER: Yeah, but what if he's being set up?  ",4,19
MULDER: Just about anybody who's up for that grant money could.  ,4,19
MULDER: What is it?  ,4,19
MULDER: A lethal injection?  ,4,19
"MULDER: No, there's somebody I want to talk to first.  ",4,19
"MULDER: Lisa Ianelli? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.  ",4,19
MULDER: Yeah. You may remember me from this afternoon. I spoke with Jason.  ,4,19
"MULDER: Not any more, apparently.  ",4,19
MULDER: In his heated hotel room.  ,4,19
MULDER: Why not?  ,4,19
"MULDER: Well, if he's already dead, then he's got nothing to lose.  ",4,19
"MULDER: Scully, look at his temperature.  ",4,19
MULDER: I think the real question is how somebody could have had access to a compound that doesn't exist.  ,4,19
MULDER: You say he followed you off the bus?  ,4,19
MULDER: And you were on your way to see Jason?  ,4,19
MULDER: That's what he can't tell anyone?  ,4,19
"MULDER: Scully? (they step aside for a private conversation) It doesn't really makes sense, Scully. Why would he threaten her if he's the one who's protecting her secret.  ",4,19
MULDER: With a medical instrument?  ,4,19
"MULDER: Well what if it's not a murder weapon? I'm just speculating, but what if it was designed for some other purpose?  ",4,19
MULDER: (to policeman) Tell the unit to keep watch until we get there. (motions toward Lisa) Make sure she gets home safely.  ,4,19
"MULDER: Federal agents, sir, open the door.  ",4,19
MULDER: Hotel manager says he's been living here for five days.  ,4,19
"MULDER: Hey, look at this.  ",4,19
MULDER: And what's the occasion?  ,4,19
MULDER: Or something that never happened.  ,4,19
MULDER: In a future that somebody is trying like hell to prevent from happening.  ,4,19
"MULDER: Think about it, Scully. If Lucas Menand never gets hit by the bus, his complaint gets heard before the grant committee. Jason Nichols loses his funding and he never gets to collaborate on his research with Dr. Yonechi. Therefore, this photograph never gets taken because this celebration never happens.  ",4,19
"MULDER: The old man couldn't save Lucas Menand, so he had to kill Dr. Yonechi.  ",4,19
"MULDER: At least five years in the future, when they first synthesized the freezing compound successfully. (he looks at the elevator and pushes the call button again) Let's take the stairs.  ",4,19
MULDER: Only because the old man brought it back with him.  ,4,19
MULDER: From when may be the real question.  ,4,19
"MULDER: Unless you have a better explanation for how he knew exactly when and how Lucas Menand was gonna be killed, why Jason Nichol's fingerprints are inside that patrol car, and how he knew Lisa Ianelli's secret.  ",4,19
"MULDER: Jason Nichols. Although common sense may rule out the possibility of time travel, the laws of quantum physics certainly do not. In case you forgot, that's from your graduate thesis. (smiling at her) You were a lot more open-minded when you were a youngster.  ",4,19
"MULDER: Well, there's one sure to prove that theoretical possiblity.  ",4,19
MULDER: Show this photograph to Lisa Ianelli and ask her if it was ever taken.  ,4,19
MULDER: Jason.  ,4,19
MULDER: I arranged for your bail.  ,4,19
"MULDER: Well, that's why I'm here. Something's happened to her.  ",4,19
MULDER: I think it's something you should see for yourself. She's at the Medical Research Facility.  ,4,19
MULDER: Yes.  ,4,19
"MULDER: Look, Jason, I don't expect you to get your mind around this completely right now ...  ",4,19
MULDER: The man we're looking for - the old man - he's you.  ,4,19
"MULDER: If that photo is indicative of a pattern, you may be his next target. It puts a whole new spin on being your own worst enemy, huh?  ",4,19
"MULDER: Not according to the photo specialist that I had examine it. As far as she can tell, it's the real McCoy.  ",4,19
"MULDER: Jason, it's your story.  ",4,19
MULDER: So was your rapid freezing agent until two days ago. Now why don't you just consider the evidence as a scientist. How could the old man come to possess a compound that you yourself admit doesn't exist?  ,4,19
MULDER: I'm not sure of that yet.  ,4,19
"MULDER: Well, I think it has something to do with the practical application of your compound, though I don't know what that is yet.  ",4,19
"MULDER: Physicists like Stephen Hawking have hypothesized the existence of wormholes and closed time loops, actual portals through which matter can travel backward through time. Although, phenomena like extreme heat and gravity would render the trip lethal for any organism.  ",4,19
"MULDER: Eventually, yes, that's what I'm saying.  ",4,19
MULDER: That's what I'm hoping the old man can tell us.  ,4,19
"MULDER: Listen to me, Jason. I need you to get to Scully and tell her that he's here. She's in the frostbite bay with Lisa. Can you do that? All right.  ",4,19
MULDER: Has anybody been through here in the last hour?  ,4,19
"MULDER: No, I'm looking for an older man, a man in his mid-seventies maybe.  ",4,19
MULDER: Do you work with him?  ,4,19
MULDER: You have access to his files.  ,4,19
MULDER: I'd like to pull up some information about his rapid freezing compound.  ,4,19
MULDER: (to phone) Mulder.  ,4,19
MULDER: Did Jason help?  ,4,19
"MULDER: All right, he should have been there five minutes ago, Scully.  ",4,19
"MULDER: Let me get back to you, Scully. (he hangs up) (to research assistant) What?  ",4,19
"MULDER: What do you mean, ""whacked""?  ",4,19
MULDER: Jason!  ,4,19
"MULDER: Jason! (he pounds the door) She's alive, Lisa's alive! Don't hurt him! If you hurt him, we'll never know the truth! Open the door.  ",4,19
"MULDER: No, and I'm not holding out much hope that they will, either.  ",4,19
"MULDER: They won't find him. I know what I saw, Scully, and I know what I believe happened.  ",4,19
"MULDER: Never? Never is a very long time, Scully, you said that yourself. ""Although multidimensionality suggests infinite outcomes in an infinite number of universes, each universe can produce only one outcome.""  ",4,19
"MULDER: Yeah, but I take that to mean that you were suggesting that the future can't be altered. Which means that the elder Jason Nichols' attempts to stop his own research will fail, and that eventually his compound, and time travel, will be discovered.  ",4,19
"MULDER: (pointing at the monkey baby's head) I admit the photo's a little over the top, but uh, what do you think Scully?  ",4,20
MULDER: Children born with vestigial tails don't interest you?  ,4,20
"MULDER: Five times within the last three months, all in a town with a population of less than 15,000 people? I'd say that's a little more than a statistical anomaly.  ",4,20
MULDER: I called around. They're already investigating.  ,4,20
MULDER: That's good to hear.  ,4,20
MULDER: When you were admitted you said that the baby's father was from another planet. What did you mean by that exactly?  ,4,20
MULDER: Were you abducted?  ,4,20
MULDER: But the baby's father is an alien?  ,4,20
"MULDER: Take your best shot, Scully, but I think there's more going on here than Luke Skywalker and his light saber.  ",4,20
MULDER: (Whispers to Scully) What answer?  ,4,20
MULDER: Yeah?  ,4,20
MULDER: Meaning the father had a tail as well?  ,4,20
MULDER: How would this happen?  ,4,20
"MULDER: Birds do it, bees do it, even educated MD's do it. All five of these women shared the same OB-GYN, didn't they?  ",4,20
"MULDER: And four of the five women, the four married women not including Amanda Nelligan, were on record as receiving insemination therapy as a means of conception.  ",4,20
MULDER: So much for not putting all your eggs in one basket.  ,4,20
"MULDER: Uh, I'm Special Agent Mulder with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and this is Agent Scully. (he flashes his badge)  ",4,20
"MULDER: Yeah, we're just here to find out what's going on.  ",4,20
MULDER: Why was it necessary to inseminate in these cases?  ,4,20
MULDER: Hey.  ,4,20
MULDER: Excuse me. I'm an agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I'd like to ask you a few questions.  ,4,20
"MULDER: Scully, check it out. (He pulls the back of Eddie's pants back to show the scar)  ",4,20
"MULDER: Oh, we'll get right on that.  ",4,20
MULDER: Yeah. Like how'd you do it?  ,4,20
MULDER: So you're saying there was romance involved?  ,4,20
"MULDER: Well, if you're waiting for my usual theory as to what's going on, I don't have one.  ",4,20
MULDER: A tranquilizer? I didn't think of that.  ,4,20
"MULDER: Yeah, but when and where would he have had the opportunity to slip it to them?  ",4,20
MULDER: Those women don't look like the type that do a lot of solo drinking.  ,4,20
"MULDER: (Mulder rings the bell at the desk, and Scully walks over to him) I found Van Blundht's clothes in the locker room. He must have walked out of here wearing the deputy's spare uniform.  ",4,20
MULDER: I have a theory. Do you want to hear it?  ,4,20
"MULDER: Hey Scully, should we be picking out china patterns or what?  ",4,20
MULDER: What about what the sheriff saw?  ,4,20
"MULDER: Conversely my theory goes a long way to explaining how four married women could mistake Van Blundht for their husbands, and how Amanda Nelligan could think it was Luke Skywalker. We've both seen something like this before, Scully.  ",4,20
MULDER: Not unless they have trailer parks in space. This is something different.  ,4,20
"MULDER: Hey Scully, if you could be somebody else for a day, who would it be?  ",4,20
"MULDER: So boring! I mean, wouldn't you even be tempted to try out someone else's existence for a day, live your life as somebody else?  ",4,20
"MULDER: Well, maybe it's not, I mean everybody else around you would treat you like you were somebody else, and ultimately maybe it's other people's reactions to us that make us who we are.  ",4,20
MULDER: It can't be a dead person.  ,4,20
MULDER: Because.  ,4,20
MULDER: We were uh...we're with the FBI. (she flashes her badge) Is this the home of Edward Van Blundht?  ,4,20
"MULDER: We're looking for your son, Eddie junior.  ",4,20
MULDER: Is this...is this you?  ,4,20
"MULDER: Does your son have any other unique medical conditions, I mean, aside from the tail?  ",4,20
"MULDER: Excuse me, sir, how did you know my name was Mulder?  ",4,20
MULDER: (giving chase) It's him!  ,4,20
"MULDER: Pretty spry for an old guy, huh?  ",4,20
"MULDER: Well, whichever one he is, wouldn't you say he's a man with a secret?  ",4,20
MULDER: I'll check upstairs.  ,4,20
MULDER: I'm all right!  ,4,20
MULDER: Ohhh. It's quicklime. Move back over there.  ,4,20
MULDER: Not so spry. You think the fall killed him?  ,4,20
MULDER: So what killed Eddie the monkey man?  ,4,20
MULDER: What's the other thing?  ,4,20
MULDER: What's unusual about that?  ,4,20
MULDER: Where did you find it?  ,4,20
"MULDER: Um, could that somehow be related to his uh, having a tail?  ",4,20
"MULDER: What would be the, uh, purpose of, of this, uh...muscle?  ",4,20
"MULDER: Could this be a ""like father like son"" kind of a thing?  ",4,20
"MULDER: Uh, could Eddie junior have, uh, the same anomalous muscular structure as his dad here?  ",4,20
"MULDER: Well, um, if this musculature underlies the entire skin, then maybe it could be utilized to remold the skin's shape and texture. Which would go a long way to explaining why we're looking for a man who can appear to be his own father, or anyone else for that matter.  ",4,20
MULDER: Check that out. (he heads for the door)  ,4,20
MULDER: Something about Van Blundht's MO confuses me. His victims were four married women who wanted to get pregnant ...  ,4,20
MULDER: (to nurse) I'm here to see Amanda Nelligan?  ,4,20
MULDER: What about Eddie?  ,4,20
MULDER: (to phone) Mulder.  ,4,20
"MULDER: Excuse me, sir?  ",4,20
MULDER: Uh huh.  ,4,20
"MULDER: I'm sorry Mr Nieman, I'm going to have to call you back. (To Amanda) I was just here. Where did I go?  ",4,20
MULDER: (to nurse) There was a man. He looked exactly like me. Did you see where he went?  ,4,20
MULDER: Thank you.  ,4,20
MULDER: Hey.  ,4,20
MULDER: Van Blundht ...  ,4,20
MULDER: (holding his gun on him) Think about it. Get your hands up. Turn around.  ,4,20
"MULDER: Keep them up there. Put your hands down now. (he handcuffs him) If it's not you, I apologize in advance.  ",4,20
MULDER: Pull your pants up.  ,4,20
MULDER: You're the only ones here?  ,4,20
"MULDER: I apologize. Only one of you is the man I'm looking for. I hope. I gotta wait for some blood tests to come back and then I'll release the other one. So why don't you just sit back and relax? Keep your clothes on, huh?  ",4,20
"MULDER: Yeah, hey, it's me. I think you should get down to the hospital right away, okay?  ",4,20
MULDER: (yelling) Hello? Hellooo!! Get me out of here!  ,4,20
MULDER: Hello! Hello! I'm down here! Help!  ,4,20
MULDER: What's with the hat? (It reads: Superstar!)  ,4,20
MULDER: Does it?  ,4,20
"MULDER: What did you want to talk to me about, Eddie?  ",4,20
MULDER: On what do you base that astute assessment?  ,4,20
"MULDER: Yeah, but I'm no Eddie Van Blundht either. Am I?  ",4,20
"MULDER: Oh, you are home.  ",4,21
MULDER: I was trying to reach you. I think your phone's off the hook.  ,4,21
MULDER: (noticing the trash bag) Is that why you're taking the garbage out at 4 in the morning?  ,4,21
MULDER: I want some answers.  ,4,21
"MULDER: The unexplained death of a postal worker that somebody is apparently going to great lengths to keep unexplained. (hands him something) These photos were sent to me by a detective who thought I might have a fresh take on the case, but when I went to retrieve them from my e-mail, somebody had hollowed out the files.  ",4,21
MULDER: From his partner.  ,4,21
MULDER: After he finished questioning me about the detective's death.  ,4,21
"MULDER: He was killed, shot in the head execution-style. His body was found near the precinct two hours ago ... possibly by the same person who forged my name to gain access to evidence from the forensics lab.  ",4,21
"MULDER: Well, I'd like your help on this, sir.  ",4,21
MULDER: Agent Scully is in the hospital.  ,4,21
"MULDER: She's undergoing some imaging tests. Her, uh, her oncologist was concerned about some microscopy results that, uh, her tumor may be metastasizing. Anyway, I, I'd like you to take a look at those photos, please.  ",4,21
"MULDER: (looking at the trash bag) Want me to, uh, dump this on my way out?  ",4,21
MULDER: All right.  ,4,21
"MULDER: (on phone) Her body's gone, sir.  ",4,21
"MULDER: The postal worker in the photos that I gave you. Her body was stolen from the morgue last night, along with any other evidence that might explain how or why she died.  ",4,21
"MULDER: I'm sorry, but I can't. I'm playing catch-up here, and I'm already two steps behind. The man who impersonated me at the forensics lab last night, apparently he replaced a blood sample.  ",4,21
"MULDER: I had them run a test. The blood sample in the police forensics lab is B-positive, as is the postal worker's, but she suffered from a mild form of anemia characterized by a folic acid deficiency. The blood sample at the police forensics lab has a normal folate serum level.  ",4,21
"MULDER: No, but I do have a place to start. The gun that killed Detective Thomas - ballistics has identified it as a Sig-Sauer P228. (Skinner walks across the room to his desk) I'm having ballistics run comps on all weapons registered to federal agents and, uh, local officers.  ",4,21
MULDER: Sir?  ,4,21
MULDER: I will.  ,4,21
MULDER: Sir? You looking for me?  ,4,21
MULDER: First Nations Bank of Virginia.  ,4,21
"MULDER: The bank is adjacent to the police headquarters where the detective was killed. Their parking lot surveillance camera caught this image. That man there - that's Detective Thomas. This man in the baseball hat - he was identified by the officer on duty at the forensics lab as ""Agent Mulder"".  ",4,21
MULDER: I'm gonna hand deliver it to Special Photo right now. What did you want to talk to me about? You were writing me a note.  ,4,21
MULDER: Thanks for getting down here so quickly.  ,4,21
MULDER: A break. Maybe even a lead.  ,4,21
MULDER: I wanted you to get a look at this body before somebody tried to steal it. See these pocks and blisters? They're the same as we saw in the photo of the deceased postal worker.  ,4,21
MULDER: Smallpox. The first reported case in over seven years.  ,4,21
"MULDER: According to the coroner, an especially virulent strain caused by a mutated variola virus.  ",4,21
MULDER: From these.  ,4,21
"MULDER: Bee stingers and venom sacs recovered subcutaneously from the victim's face, arm and neck.  ",4,21
MULDER: He was a forensic entomologist. I consulted with him several months ago about a similar fatality.  ,4,21
"MULDER: Yeah, but I've never had any hard evidence. Not until now. I think that's what somebody's gone to great lengths to try to prevent.  ",4,21
MULDER: I can only guess. But I think that somebody is trying to engineer a method of delivery ... for a disease that has killed more people throughout history than any other contagion known to humankind. If you want me to suggest an appropriate response ...  ,4,21
"MULDER: How can we stop them? We don't even know who these people are, and we won't until we know the identity of that shooter.  ",4,21
"MULDER: Hopefully, very. I've got one of the photo techs pulling an all-nighter on that surveillance video so he can show me something this morning. I told him that you'd authorize the overtime.  ",4,21
MULDER: I'm gonna go over there right now.  ,4,21
MULDER: So this is the best you can do?  ,4,21
MULDER: I'm not trying to be difficult. It's just this is very important to me. I need to be sure.  ,4,21
MULDER: (somewhat shaky voice) I need you to print out a hardcopy of that for me.  ,4,21
MULDER: Put the gun down and move away from the desk.  ,4,21
MULDER: (shouts) I said put the gun down!  ,4,21
MULDER: No. I do now.  ,4,21
MULDER: Is that the gun you used to shoot the detective?  ,4,21
MULDER: How's it feel to shoot an innocent man in the head?  ,4,21
"MULDER: You're a liar! You've been working with the Smoking Man all along. You knew when he had my father killed, and you knew when they took Scully.  ",4,21
MULDER: I've heard enough of you.  ,4,21
MULDER: I don't believe you.  ,4,21
MULDER: Give me the gun.  ,4,21
MULDER: How soon will you be able to determine if that's the weapon that killed Detective Thomas?  ,4,21
MULDER: So this is definitely the murder weapon?  ,4,21
"MULDER: In a sewer grate ... (Skinner looks up quickly at Mulder, who returns his look) ... around the corner from the crime scene. Sometimes you get lucky.  ",4,21
MULDER: What do you mean?  ,4,21
"MULDER: Hey, Scully, take a look at this.  ",4,22
MULDER: The pin setter. You see the way it's wedged and broken?  ,4,22
MULDER: Mr. Pintero said the only way that would happen would be if considerable weight or pressure was placed on it from above.  ,4,22
"MULDER: No one's suggesting that you are, Mr. Pintero.  ",4,22
"MULDER: Can I ask you a favor? Can I get a soda, a cola, something like that?  ",4,22
MULDER: Thanks.  ,4,22
"MULDER: What is that look, Scully?  ",4,22
"MULDER: What, you don't believe in ghosts?  ",4,22
MULDER: Sounds more like a disembodied soul.  ,4,22
"MULDER: Except according to Mr. Pintero, this one was trying to communicate. It was speaking to him as if she was trying to tell him something. It sounds more like a death omen.  ",4,22
MULDER: Yeah. It's a spirit being that arrives as a harbinger of death.  ,4,22
"MULDER: This is the third reported sighting in as many weeks ... and as many murders. Each time the victim appearing near the crime scene trying to communicate, trying to say something.  ",4,22
"MULDER: I don't know yet but, uh, ... (to Pintero, who has returned with a drink) ... thank you. (To Scully) If you hold on a second I may have an answer for you.  ",4,22
MULDER: She is me.  ,4,22
MULDER: Written onto the wax - she is me - look at this!  ,4,22
"MULDER: No, not at all.  ",4,22
"MULDER: No, actually I do have something to add. I think that following the FBI model in this case will not only fail to turn up the killer but will undoubtedly lead to more victims and more deaths.  ",4,22
MULDER: I'm Special Agent Mulder. This is Agent Scully. We're from the FBI. We're here following up a lead that seems to have been dropped - a statement made by the proprietor of the bowling alley that ...  ,4,22
"MULDER: No, no, not the victim. Her apparition, what the Irish call a fetch, what is more commonly known as a wraith.  ",4,22
MULDER: Were there any written messages in any of these other cases?  ,4,22
"MULDER: Do the words ""she is me"" have any meaning to you?  ",4,22
MULDER: Those were her dying words?  ,4,22
MULDER: Well who made that call?  ,4,22
MULDER: What do you mean?  ,4,22
MULDER: And no one followed up on this lead?  ,4,22
MULDER: I'd appreciate that.  ,4,22
MULDER: Hi. I wanted to ask if anybody used the pay phone out in the hallway there on Friday night - because somebody called the police and reported a murder.  ,4,22
MULDER: That was Sloppy Joe night.  ,4,22
MULDER: (holding up a picture of the latest victim) Anybody recognize this woman?  ,4,22
MULDER: (to Alpert) The quiet man in the back.  ,4,22
"MULDER: The only one who didn't raise his hand, yeah. Has he ever been a problem?  ",4,22
MULDER: Do you think I could talk to him.  ,4,22
"MULDER: (looking at the photo) A wedding ring, yeah.  ",4,22
"MULDER: So what, he stole her ring?  ",4,22
"MULDER: Oh, he switched it.  ",4,22
"MULDER: Nice catch, Scully. Any idea about the psychology at work?  ",4,22
"MULDER: Not ordinarily unless there was a more complex psychology at work, like pronounced mental illness.  ",4,22
"MULDER: I'm not sure if the killer is here, but certainly the person that made that phone call is, and I think his name is Harold Spuller.  ",4,22
MULDER: No but he's about to.  ,4,22
"MULDER: You made that phone call, didn't you Harold?  ",4,22
"MULDER: Did you say the words ""she is me""?  ",4,22
MULDER: Have you ever heard those words?  ,4,22
"MULDER: Have you ever seen a ghost, Harold?  ",4,22
MULDER: So why all of a sudden?  ,4,22
MULDER: That outburst didn't come until after I'd asked him if he'd ever seen a ghost.  ,4,22
MULDER: Yeah.  ,4,22
MULDER: I'm sure Harold Spuller is the man that made that phone call. But what led us to him still remains unexplained.  ,4,22
"MULDER: Uh huh, and the other apparitions, like the one Mr. Pintero saw at the bowling alley.  ",4,22
MULDER: Oh Scully ...  ,4,22
MULDER: You sure?  ,4,22
MULDER: (knocking on the door of the washroom) Scully?  ,4,22
"MULDER: Scully, you in there?  ",4,22
MULDER: (opening the washroom door) They found another victim. A college student with her throat cut. Just about a half block from here.  ,4,22
"MULDER: Her name was Loren Heller, age 21. She's single, apparently she was on her way home from a bar that she part-timed at after school. She had a ring on her left hand, switched to her right hand, pinky finger. She was dead less than an hour when she was found.  ",4,22
"MULDER: No, actually it doesn't. Harold's not at the home. He's nowhere to be found. His nurse locked him in his room after we left, but he managed to escape unnoticed.  ",4,22
"MULDER: Yeah, but I think we should be the ones to find him, if only to find out what ""she is me"" means.  ",4,22
MULDER: What?  ,4,22
MULDER: You want me to drive you?  ,4,22
MULDER: You're sure?  ,4,22
"MULDER: Yeah, I'm looking for Harold Spuller.  ",4,22
MULDER: Suspicion of murder.  ,4,22
"MULDER: You obviously don't think so, huh?  ",4,22
MULDER: You know where he is now?  ,4,22
MULDER: He has a key?  ,4,22
MULDER: Did you ever get lane 6 working?  ,4,22
"MULDER: Harold? (Harold ducks back into the service area and climbs a ladder. Mulder slides under the pin setter into the service area and pursues.) Harold? (He follows Harold up the ladder.) Harold, I just want to talk to you. Harold?  ",4,22
MULDER: Harold?  ,4,22
"MULDER: (gently) Harold? Harold, you knew those women who were murdered, didn't you? That's why you're scared. You're afraid they've come back to visit you. Penny Timmons.  ",4,22
MULDER: Missy Shapiro.  ,4,22
MULDER: Michelle Chamberlain.  ,4,22
MULDER: What was her shoe size?  ,4,22
"MULDER: Harold, there are people who think that you murdered these women. I'm not one of them. But I need your help for me to prove that. You think you can do that? I think you can.  ",4,22
MULDER: Mr. Pintero? I'd like to search the building for any ways in or out that Harold might have of the bowling alley.  ,4,22
MULDER: Thanks.  ,4,22
MULDER: I'm hoping it will become clear to us when we find it.  ,4,22
MULDER: I think so.  ,4,22
"MULDER: Choose a name. Pick a name, pick any name up there.  ",4,22
MULDER: 200 game. that's not bad.  ,4,22
MULDER: Including the victims.  ,4,22
"MULDER: I'm not sure exactly, but I think that ...  ",4,22
MULDER: Hey Scully. Is it too late?  ,4,22
MULDER: I needed your help on something. I needed your medical expertise.  ,4,22
"MULDER: Harold Spuller. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't even ask you. What did your doctor say?  ",4,22
MULDER: Good.  ,4,22
"MULDER: Angie Pintero, the bowling alley guy? He's dead.  ",4,22
MULDER: Natural causes. Congestive heart failure. Just keeled over right in the bowling alley.  ,4,22
MULDER: No. Howard Spuller had a preminatory vision of his boss's death.  ,4,22
MULDER: Harold saw an apparation - what may have been Angie Pintero's disembodied soul at the moment of or just prior to his death.  ,4,22
MULDER: Because I was standing right there when he saw it.  ,4,22
MULDER: No.  ,4,22
"MULDER: I don't have that facility, that kind of connection to the victims that would have made such a vision possible.  ",4,22
"MULDER: I don't know its exact nature but I think it has something to do with his autism ... that Harold experienced a profound attachment to these victims but because of his disability was unable to express the depth and power of those relationships, so somehow a psychic or preconscious bond was formed that went beyond the temporal.  ",4,22
"MULDER: Yeah, from the bowling alley, going back seven years.  ",4,22
"MULDER: No, but he does have something in common with those who've had the visions that is quite powerful in its own right.  ",4,22
"MULDER: Well, they were all dying ... one of emphysema, one of cancer and now Angie Pintero.  ",4,22
MULDER: Well that's what I need your medical opinion on.  ,4,22
MULDER: I would be very surprised. What is a death omen if not a vision of our own mortality? And who among us would most likely be able to see the dead? Harold's at the resident home right now.  ,4,22
MULDER: Thanks for accomodating us again.  ,4,22
MULDER: I understand.  ,4,22
"MULDER: Agent Scully's a doctor. If you can arrange to have Harold's medical records made available, that would expedite the ...  ",4,22
MULDER: Tell me exactly what happened.  ,4,22
MULDER: Did he say anything?  ,4,22
"MULDER: I want you to call the police. Ask for Detective Hudak. Tell them what happened, tell them to look for Harold down at the bowling alley.  ",4,22
MULDER: I don't see that there's any way around that. Sorry.  ,4,22
"MULDER: Well, that's a superficial head wound, Scully. He didn't mean to kill her or maim her. That's not the work of a murderer if you ask me.  ",4,22
MULDER: Maybe Harold is sicker than we thought he was.  ,4,22
MULDER: I think there's someone you can talk to about it. Why don't you talk to his roommate and I'll see what I can do about finding Harold.  ,4,22
MULDER: (looking at Scully's hand) You're cut.  ,4,22
"MULDER: Yeah, but why did you even suspect her?  ",4,22
MULDER: Why do you think she killed those women?  ,4,22
MULDER: She is me.  ,4,22
"MULDER: Yeah. They found in an alley a few blocks from here, face down on the pavement. They worked on him for twenty minutes but he couldn't be revived.  ",4,22
"MULDER: Well, preliminary diagnosis is apnia - respiratory failure.  ",4,22
"MULDER: Well, the paramedics are at a loss to explain that, but if what you're saying is true, that Harold stopped taking his medications, then that could have been a factor in his death - at least in the visions that he was seeing.  ",4,22
MULDER: Is that your medical opinion?  ,4,22
MULDER: What?  ,4,22
MULDER: (in a slightly annoyed tone) Why didn't you tell me?  ,4,22
"MULDER: Is that why you came down here, to prove that it wasn't true?  ",4,22
MULDER: Why can't you be honest with me?  ,4,22
MULDER: Is that what you think I want to hear?  ,4,22
"MULDER: You can believe what you want to believe, Scully, but you can't hide the truth from me because if you do, then you're working against me ... and yourself. (his voice softens) I know what you're afraid of. I'm afraid of the same thing.  ",4,22
MULDER: I hope that's the truth.  ,4,22
MULDER: Samantha? ,4,23
MULDER: Scully. ,4,23
MULDER: I don't know. ,4,23
MULDER: I think so. ,4,23
"MULDER: I think I'm in a... a motel room in Providence, but... ",4,23
MULDER: Rhode Island. ,4,23
MULDER: I don't know. There's... t-there's blood all over me. ,4,23
MULDER: I don't think so. I don't think it's my blood.  ,4,23
MULDER: Yeah? ,4,23
MULDER: I can't get warm. ,4,23
"MULDER: N-no, but I, uh... I woke up on the floor with a pounding headache. ",4,23
MULDER: I think so. I don't know. I don't remember anything. ,4,23
"MULDER: Uh... No, what day is it? ",4,23
MULDER: I was in my apartment. I talked to you on the phone. ,4,23
MULDER: I've been here since Friday? ,4,23
MULDER: No. No. ,4,23
MULDER: No. No. ,4,23
MULDER: Yeah. ,4,23
MULDER: I don't know. ,4,23
MULDER: I don't remember that. ,4,23
"MULDER: If there was a crime committed, I need to know what happened. ",4,23
MULDER: Are these your keys? ,4,23
"MULDER: Well, then, how did I get here? ",4,23
MULDER: That's not my car. ,4,23
MULDER: Who's Amy? ,4,23
"MULDER: No, Scully. If I've shot someone, if my weapon's been used in a crime, I need to know. ",4,23
"MULDER: I know you do, but it's my risk.  ",4,23
MULDER: Are you Amy? ,4,23
MULDER: And who are you? ,4,23
"MULDER: That, uh, painting... behind you. Uh... do you think I could take a look at it? ",4,23
MULDER: Who painted this? ,4,23
MULDER: I know this house. ,4,23
MULDER: I don't know. I've seen it before. Does this house have any special meaning to Amy or David? ,4,23
MULDER: I've been to that house. ,4,23
"MULDER: I don't know, but I've been there. ",4,23
"MULDER: It's about 20 miles from here, on route eight. My parents had a summer house out there when I was a kid, in Rhode Island. ",4,23
MULDER: I don't know. It just hit me. ,4,23
MULDER: No. I remember what I saw. ,4,23
"MULDER: I had a very vivid flashback to my childhood. Except, I was there. ",4,23
"MULDER: No, just that it was very real. ",4,23
MULDER: What do you think it was? ,4,23
MULDER: Brought on by what? ,4,23
MULDER: I feel really good right now. ,4,23
MULDER: I think I've been here before. ,4,23
MULDER: Maybe. ,4,23
MULDER: I'm going to check upstairs. ,4,23
"MULDER: You mean, not without my attorney present? ",4,23
"MULDER: I had those people's blood on shirt, Scully. I was missing for two days. I have no recollection of my actions during those two days. There were two rounds discharged from my gun. I had the keys to this house, the keys to their car. Do the words ""Orenthal James Simpson"" mean anything to you? ",4,23
MULDER: I'm a little confused. ,4,23
"MULDER: I don't know. I, uh... I think I may have come here as a kid. ",4,23
"MULDER: Well, my parents had a summer house in Quonochontaug, so... ",4,23
"MULDER: I don't ever remember meeting them, no. ",4,23
MULDER: That's what I'm saying. ,4,23
MULDER: For now. ,4,23
MULDER: What's that? ,4,23
MULDER: No. Why? ,4,23
"MULDER: Well, I haven't really told you anything. ",4,23
MULDER: And you're telling me what's in that bag is evidence that I'm a liar? ,4,23
MULDER: What's in the bag? ,4,23
MULDER: No. Can I see what's in the bag now? ,4,23
MULDER: Yes. ,4,23
"MULDER: No. What about the prints... in the house? Were they my prints? Look, you're not going to get a confession out of me, because I can't answer your questions, because I don't remember. ",4,23
"MULDER: You're a doctor, not a lawyer, Scully. ",4,23
MULDER: No. Only to my own ignorance. ,4,23
"MULDER: Ketamine? That's a veterinary drug, isn't it? ",4,23
MULDER: How would that get there? ,4,23
MULDER: Scully... you don't have to do this. ,4,23
MULDER: What? That I was partying with a few senior citizens? ,4,23
MULDER: Guard! Guard! I need to talk to someone! Guard!  ,4,23
"MULDER: I didn't kill those people, Scully. ",4,23
MULDER: From where? ,4,23
MULDER: But I was there. ,4,23
MULDER: And I still don't remember why. ,4,23
MULDER: And I contacted her. ,4,23
MULDER: But why shoot herself and her husband? ,4,23
"MULDER: What was I doing there, Scully, and why didn't I do anything to stop it? ",4,23
"MULDER: I still need to know why, though.  ",4,23
"MULDER: I don't know, but we found my car. ",4,23
MULDER: What was the name of that psychologist? ,4,23
MULDER: Dr. Goldstein? My name is Fox Mulder. Have we met? ,4,23
"MULDER: How do you mean, ""aggressive""? ",4,23
MULDER: Is this an accepted form of medical treatment? ,4,23
MULDER: But you had no idea--you had no indication she might have taken her own life? ,4,23
MULDER: That won't be necessary. ,4,23
MULDER: I have been here before. I met Dr. Goldstein with Amy Cassandra. ,4,23
MULDER: I think you're right. ,4,23
MULDER: I'm fine. ,4,23
MULDER: Give me the car keys. ,4,23
"MULDER: Scully, I don't want these symptoms to go away. Whatever's happening to me, whatever treatment I've received, is allowing me to go back into my unconscious. The truth is in there, recorded, and I've gotten access to it. What happened to my sister--the reason she was taken--is becoming clear to me, and I need to know that. Now give me the keys. ",4,23
"MULDER: To my mother's, in Greenwich. ",4,23
MULDER: I need to speak to you. ,4,23
MULDER: You've kept things from me. You've kept secrets from me. ,4,23
"MULDER: You told me that, when they took Samantha, it was because you had to make a choice, but that's not how it happened. It wasn't your choice to make. ",4,23
"MULDER: I wanna know what happened that night on Quonochontaug, and I need to speak to you privately. You had some kind of relationship with him. ",4,23
"MULDER: You know who. The man who worked with my father, the man who came to you that night when I was 12, and forced you to choose Samantha. ",4,23
"MULDER: Yes! You betrayed my father, your husband. ",4,23
MULDER: How far back did it go? ,4,23
MULDER: Who is my father? ,4,23
"MULDER: Just answer the question, mom. Just answer the question! ",4,23
MULDER: What did you do to me? ,4,23
MULDER: You treated me. I asked you to treat me to recover my past. ,4,23
MULDER: You put a hole in my head. ,4,23
MULDER: It triggered my memory. ,4,23
MULDER: Now I want you to finish the job. Let's do it. I wanna remember.  ,4,23
"MULDER: Leave me alone, Scully. ",4,23
"MULDER: Scully, leave me alone.  ",4,23
MULDER: It's... all falling into place. ,4,23
MULDER: No. Don't try to stop me. ,4,23
MULDER: Get away! ,4,23
MULDER: Shut up! ,4,23
"MULDER [only in CC]: I'm so tired. I need to know, Scully. I just need to know.  ",4,23
"MULDER: Hey Scully, it's me. Sorry to interrupt your dinner.  ",4,24
"MULDER: Well, I need your help on something. I was just contacted by Doctor Arlinsky from over at the Smithsonian.  ",4,24
MULDER: About something he found on a mountain in Canada.  ,4,24
"MULDER: I'd rather not talk about it the phone, I just need you to meet me over at the Smithsonian.  ",4,24
"MULDER: Right away. (Scully looks at Bill, who leaves the kitchen with a new bottle of wine. Scully exhales deeply.)  ",4,24
MULDER: You're going to have to apologize for me to your brother and mother. This is something that just couldn't wait though.  ,4,24
MULDER: He's a forensic anthropathologist that I've been in contact with over the last four years. Several years ago he was involved in an embarrassing UFO photo enhancement scandal. But he continues to profess his innocence.  ,4,24
MULDER: I'm not going to tell you. I'm going to let you decide for yourself.  ,4,24
MULDER: Perfectly intact.  ,4,24
MULDER: That doesn't make sense. There should be signs of gradation. (Mulder walks to Arlinsky. Scully is standing in the corner.)  ,4,24
MULDER: Does that fit geologically?  ,4,24
MULDER: Who all knows about this?  ,4,24
"MULDER: If you're going to go, why not go all the way?  ",4,24
MULDER: Qualitatively indefensible. You go public with this nobody is going to believe you. You also risk never knowing for sure because the same people who bury the truth so assiduously will be in charge of its authentication.  ,4,24
MULDER: And what do you want?  ,4,24
MULDER: You think it's foolish?  ,4,24
MULDER: You have no opinion?  ,4,24
MULDER: What's that supposed to mean?  ,4,24
"MULDER: What about Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny? This is not some selfish pet project of mine, Scully. I'm as skeptical of that man as you are, but proof... definitive proof of sentient beings sharing the same time and existence with us, that would change everything. Every truth we live my would be shaken to the ground. There's no greater revelation imaginable, no greater scientific discovery.  ",4,24
"MULDER: If someone could prove to you the existence of God, would it change you?  ",4,24
MULDER: Then you accept the possibility the belief in God is a lie?  ,4,24
MULDER: But what if it could be? Wouldn't that knowledge be worth seeking? Or is it just easier to go on believing the lie?  ,4,24
MULDER: Can you at least take a look at those core samples? Tell me if they're a lie? That's all I'm asking.  ,4,24
MULDER: I thought you said there was someone meeting us.  ,4,24
MULDER: Funny place to take a nap. (They run to him. It's the man who was walking alone earlier.)  ,4,24
MULDER: He's been shot. He's our guide? (They walk on.)  ,4,24
MULDER: They had radio communication. Maybe it was being monitored. (They stop. They hear a groaning.) Someone's still alive. (They rush to Babcock's tent.)  ,4,24
"MULDER: Get him some water. Look's like he took a shotgun hit, but it didn't open him up too badly. The bleeding stopped.  ",4,24
MULDER: We won't know for sure until we do a carbon dating test.  ,4,24
MULDER: The Piltdown Man Hoax wasn't uncovered for forty years until it failed the carbon dating test. And that wasn't even very good.  ,4,24
MULDER: Mulder...  ,4,24
MULDER'S APARTMENT (Kritschgau sits on a chair across from Mulder on the sofa. Scully is leaning against the doorway between the dining and living rooms)  ,4,24
MULDER: So you're saying this has all been orchestrated? A hoax?  ,4,24
MULDER: You come by this knowledge how?  ,4,24
"MULDER: And just by chance, you run into Agent Scully?  ",4,24
MULDER: Why come to me now? Why not four years ago?  ,4,24
MULDER: And the thousands of UFO sightings?  ,4,24
MULDER: Evidence of alien biology?  ,4,24
MULDER: The body that was found?  ,4,24
"MULDER: They would have known that the body would be carbon dated, that it would be proved a fake.  ",4,24
MULDER: What do you mean?  ,4,24
MULDER: (to Scully) This man is a liar.  ,4,24
MULDER: Ah...  ,4,24
MULDER: Arlinsky's dead.  ,4,24
"MULDER: What we had here was proof, Scully, there's no way it could be anything else.  ",4,24
"MULDER: Yeah, but, the ice core samples checked out. If the ice hasn't been tampered with, how could the body within be a fake?  ",4,24
MULDER: Do we know for sure that those cells are not extraterrestrial?  ,4,24
MULDER: Facts overwhelmed by the lies created to support them!  ,4,24
"MULDER: After all I've seen and experienced, I refuse to believe that it's NOT true!  ",4,24
"MULDER: What the hell did that guy say to you, that you believe his story!?  ",4,24
MULDER: They're here....  ,5,1
MULDER: They're here...  ,5,1
MULDER: THEY'RE HERE! THEY'RE HERE!  ,5,1
"MULDER: So, fellas... You looking for somebody?  ",5,1
"MULDER: I don't think it's down here. (He notices Byers' button) Hey, you with the FCC?  ",5,1
MULDER: I think we share the same credit union. (He takes out his badge) Special Agent Fox Mulder I'm with the ... a... Federal Bureau of Investigation. I was hoping maybe you could help me. I'm ... m... looking for a girl. I was wondering if you've seen her.  ,5,1
"MULDER: What's it to you? Thanks, guys. All right?  ",5,1
"MULDER: Yeah, Mulder... Oh hey, Reggie... What's up?  ",5,1
MULDER'S VOICE: Stay where you are.  ,5,1
"MULDER: Federal agent. Susanne Modeski, you are under arrest for the murders of four people at White Stone Army Base.  ",5,1
MULDER: You three are under arrest also.  ,5,1
"MULDER: Ma'am, stay where you are.  ",5,1
"MULDER: You three get on the ground now! Ma'am, stop moving. I'm not going to ask you again.  ",5,1
"MULDER: Federal agent, identify yourself.  ",5,1
"MULDER: Step forward and identify yourselves, NOW!  ",5,1
MULDER: They're here.  ,5,1
"MULDER: Yeah I am, thank you, I just ... mmm ... I have these weird ideas in my head that I can't seem to shake.  ",5,1
MULDER: Weird ones.  ,5,1
"MULDER: I'm not sure yet, I just spoke with my ASAC and he tells me that Dr. Susanne Modeski is no longer wanted by the FBI. She's still missing, but the case has suddenly closed. What I need from you guys is to tell me what the hell happened last night.  ",5,1
"MULDER: Yeah, I want the truth.  ",5,1
MULDER: What?!  ,5,1
"MULDER'S VOICE OVER: I've held a torch in the darkness to glance upon a truth unknown. An act of faith begun with an ineloquent certainty that my journey promised the chance, not just of understanding, but of recovery. That the disappearance of my sister, 23 years ago, would come to be explained. (Mulder stands and puts his hands to his face) And that the pursuit of these greater truths about the existence of extraterrestrial life might even reunite us. A belief which I now know to be false... and uninformed... in the extreme. My folly revealed by facts which illuminate both my arrogance and self-deception. (He picks up his gun from the coffee table. He looks at it in his hand) If only the tragedy had been mine alone, might it be more easy tonight to bring this journey to its end. (He checks the clip. There are bullets in it. He loads it...the phone rings. He picks it up but doesn't say anything)  ",5,2
MULDER: Yes...  ,5,2
MULDER: Who are you? (Cut to Kritschgau in a phone booth at night)  ,5,2
MULDER: Who are you?!  ,5,2
MULDER: Did they give... Agent Scully this disease? Did they do this to her because of me?  ,5,2
MULDER: Back away! (He does. Mulder tries to stomp out the fire. Mulder looks up to see Ostlehoff grab a shotgun. Cut to the hallway outside. A gunshot. Camera pans to the door which is ajar. A hand closes the door.)  ,5,2
"MULDER: Keep going, FBI woman.  ",5,2
"MULDER: It was too crowded in my apartment, I couldn't sleep.  ",5,2
"MULDER: Good, cuz neither am I. There's a dead man on the floor of my apartment, and it's only a matter of time before he starts to stink the place up.  ",5,2
"MULDER: Apparently somebody thinks my life is interesting enough to put on video tape. My apartment's been under an electronic surveillance for at least 2 months. Look at this, courtesy of the US government. (He hands her Ostlehoff's ID card)  ",5,2
"MULDER: Yeah, he works ... he worked for the Department of Defense.  ",5,2
MULDER: Gunshot wound to the face.  ,5,2
"MULDER: I can't do that, Scully, I can't go to the authorities with this.  ",5,2
"MULDER: This man, Ostelhoff, worked for the military. Are you beginning to get the picture? Do you see what's happening here?  ",5,2
"MULDER: This hoax, your cancer, everything! It just doesn't lead back to the military, it leads right back to the FBI!  ",5,2
"MULDER: This man, Ostelhoff, was set up in the apartment directly above mine. I caught him trying to destroy phone records on which the same number was called 17 times. (Scully looks at a phone log Mulder shows her.)  ",5,2
MULDER: Yeah.  ,5,2
MULDER: I don't know.  ,5,2
"MULDER: Maybe since the beginning, since you joined me on the X-Files.  ",5,2
"MULDER: There are those who can be trusted. What I need to know is who among them is not. I will not allow this treason to prosper, not if they've done this to you.  ",5,2
"MULDER: No, but as they lie to us, we can lie to them. A lie to find the truth.  ",5,2
"MULDER'S VOICE OVER: Let the truth be known though the heavens fall. The web of lies entangling us can now be connected back to the very institution which brought us together. (Scully shows her ID to the cops in Mulder's apartment and she is let through.) The facts supported by a byzantine plot, executed by someone inside the FBI who, if named could be tied to the hoax meant to destroy me. (Scully sees the body on the floor in front of the couch.) And to the terminal disease inflicted on Scully. In four years, I have shared my partner's passionate search for the truth. And if my part has been a deception, I have never seen her integrity waver... (The detective pulls the sheet up from the dead man's face) or her honor compromised. (Scully nods and leaves) But now, I ask her to lie, to the people that lied to us. A dangerous lie to find the truth. To find the men who would be revealed as its enemy... (Scully enters the hallway) as OUR enemy. As the enemy within.  ",5,2
"MULDER'S VOICE OVER: The military connection to the conspiracy we had pierced was now undeniable. The man who lay dead in my apartment worked for the Department of Defense at its Advanced Research facility. (He goes to security area) What I might find here, I was uncertain of. But my crime had provided me access. As long as they believed Scully's lie, that it was me lying on my floor, I might learn truths here. (Mulder sees that everyone is using a code card to get in. He puts Ostlehoff's through the scanner) But, if our lies were discovered, both Scully and I would be discovered with them. (The light turns green and Mulder can enter)  ",5,2
MULDER: Through the front door.  ,5,2
MULDER (Mulder shows him the code card) You can if you have the card.  ,5,2
MULDER: You knew my apartment was being surveilled. How? (He smiles again)  ,5,2
"MULDER: Someone at the FBI is involved, this man Ostelhoff, was in contact with somebody ...  ",5,2
MULDER: I found it on a dead man.  ,5,2
"MULDER: Level 4 clearance, that means I get to dine at the officer's club?  ",5,2
MULDER: I need to know who did this to Scully!  ,5,2
MULDER: What?  ,5,2
"MULDER: The cure for Scully's cancer? (Notice how he doesn't say anything about his sister, Samantha? Kritschgau nods.)  ",5,2
MULDER: What am I looking for?  ,5,2
MULDER: DNA from whom?  ,5,2
MULDER: But what does all this have to do with flying saucers?  ,5,2
MULDER: Germ warfare. We were accused of using it in the Korea.  ,5,2
MULDER: What about all the reports of abductions? You're saying they've all been lies?  ,5,2
MULDER: But I've seen aliens. I've witnessed these things.  ,5,2
"MULDER: Then why a hoax? Why create hard evidence, an alien body that could be disproved?  ",5,2
MULDER: Scully would have known.  ,5,2
MULDER: You went along with all this. You let them do this to Scully.  ,5,2
"MULDER: You believe there's a cure for him in here, too.  ",5,2
"MULDER: I had come here looking for answers hoping not only to lay bare this conspiracy against the country and the men behind it but to finally learn the truth about the possibility of intelligent extraterrestrial life. (A door at the end of the hall opens and two security men enter. Mulder tries more doors and finds one and enters and closes the door as he talks) Now with what I've heard my beliefs seem more and more improbable. The possibility of a cure for Scully somewhere inside these walls is my only hope but if I might find it and somehow save her the very existence of such a cure would mean with certainty that I had believed in a lie from the start. (He's relieved when they walk away. The room he entered is a big, dark one filled to the brim with tables containing grey aliens)  ",5,2
"MULDER: If Agent Scully and I had been led to believe that the conspiracy meant to destroy us has its roots in the Department of Defense, that fact seems all but irrefutable now. I have gained access to a large storage facility by a hallway connecting underground to the Pentagon. On hundreds of rows of shelves are materials that reveal nothing to me of a cure for Scully's cancer. And now, as I have reached the terminus of this space, what appears to be an old and antiquated filing system seems my only hope of finding what this man Kritschgau has assured me exists. (He pulls a ladder over and climbs to higher on a wall of little filing drawers) If his own desperate hope for his son's cure has eluded him, I now share his desperation. That among these drawers is a sign, a glimmer, some small confirmation that the journey which has brought me here has not been in vain. (He opens SCU-SCY. There are two rows of index cards. He flips through and sees Scully, Dana Katherine with her date of birth, 2-23-64, her position number 2317-616 and four rows of other numbers. He takes the card and then opens another card file and pulls out Kritschgau, Michael Jr. It's blank)  ",5,2
"MULDER'S VOICE OVER: If I did indeed have the cure for Scully's cancer, I was now as dependent on her as she was on me. As I had breached this facility I needed to find my way out to safety... (Cut to Scully walking down the hallway in FBI Headquarters in the blue suit from Gethsemane hearing) depending on Scully to weave her story, to tell her tale, to make them believe the lie.  ",5,2
MULDER: What? What is it?  ,5,2
"MULDER: Can you help me? I'm looking for a woman... (Nurse, busy, walks away. He goes to the nurses station) Excuse me, I'm looking for a Dana Scully who was brought into ... (The nurse, on the phone, holds her hand up for him to be quiet. He continues down the desk to another nurse) ",5,3
MULDER: I will calm down when someone gives me a reason to calm down. Now I'm looking for a patient who was admitted to the ER!  ,5,3
MULDER: Yes.  ,5,3
"MULDER: Well, where is she?  ",5,3
MULDER: Where is that?  ,5,3
MULDER: Where is she?  ,5,3
MULDER: ICU.  ,5,3
MULDER: I'm only half dead.  ,5,3
MULDER: What happened to her?  ,5,3
MULDER: Due to what? (No answer) Do to what?!  ,5,3
MULDER: Let go of me. (They struggle)  ,5,3
MULDER: Get the hell off of me! (Skinner grabs him by the lapels)  ,5,3
MULDER: Are you suggesting that I can?  ,5,3
"MULDER: Help myself, how?  ",5,3
"MULDER: That helps you, how doesn't that help me?  ",5,3
MULDER: Are we finished then?  ,5,3
"MULDER: Thanks, buddy.  ",5,3
MULDER: You should have mentioned that at the hospital when you were hauling my ass off!  ,5,3
"MULDER: That's a good place to lay it, considering her condition.  ",5,3
MULDER: How can you help me?  ,5,3
"MULDER: The disease she has was given to her by somebody connected to the FBI, to a mole working here.  ",5,3
"MULDER: I failed to find that out, sir.  ",5,3
"MULDER: I heard you were being moved out of the ICU, that you were feeling better.  ",5,3
MULDER: It's okay. (He clutches her hand. He kisses her on the cheek) I'm officially among the undead.  ,5,3
MULDER: I did not come here to talk about that.  ,5,3
"MULDER: Well, there's not much to talk about anyway, I'm going to testify to everything I know in front of the FBI assembly. The conspiracy, the men behind it, what I believe is its purpose.  ",5,3
MULDER: No. But that doesn't matter now.  ,5,3
"MULDER: Hey, Scully, how about those Yankees, huh?  ",5,3
"MULDER: Yeah, Skinner's withholding it.  ",5,3
MULDER: I don't believe that.  ,5,3
"MULDER: No, not Skinner.  ",5,3
MULDER: But if I don't testify now they'll start to bury the truth.  ,5,3
MULDER: I can.... (He smiles and shakes his head) I can't do that.  ,5,3
"MULDER: Hi, Mrs. Scully.  ",5,3
"MULDER: No. I was just on my way out. (Mulder kisses Scully on the cheek. He stands and sees Bill) Hi, I'm Fox Mulder, I don't think we've ever met.  ",5,3
MULDER: I'm sorry about your sister.  ,5,3
MULDER: Yeah?  ,5,3
MULDER: Please tell me you're here with severe chest pains.  ,5,3
MULDER: Go to hell.  ,5,3
MULDER: What are you talking about?  ,5,3
MULDER: What I found was useless.  ,5,3
MULDER: He promised me it would be in here.  ,5,3
MULDER: It may be for Scully's.  ,5,3
MULDER: Shortly after she was abducted she discovered a small metallic chip implanted subcutaneously in your neck... It was a short time after she had it removed that she developed cancer.  ,5,3
"MULDER: Watch your language, Frohike, and grab me some tweezers.  ",5,3
MULDER: Crazy in what sense? In that it might save your sister's life?  ,5,3
MULDER: This is not science fiction.  ,5,3
MULDER: Would she have to stop her conventional treatment?  ,5,3
"MULDER: If it works, I don't care what you think she thinks.  ",5,3
"MULDER: Why is that, because I don't think the way you think? Because I won't just sit passively back and watch the family tragedy unfold?  ",5,3
MULDER: No...  ,5,3
"MULDER: In a way, I think I do. I lost someone very close to me. I lost a sister, I lost my father, all because of this thing I'm looking for.  ",5,3
MULDER: One sorry son of a bitch speaking.  ,5,3
MULDER: Yes.  ,5,3
MULDER: There still is.  ,5,3
"MULDER: You could say that, yeah.  ",5,3
MULDER: I'll keep that in mind.  ,5,3
MULDER: I think that's my sister. (He goes outside. Samantha gets out of the car) Samantha?  ,5,3
MULDER: Who? Who told you that?  ,5,3
MULDER: Why?  ,5,3
MULDER: But you called that man your father?  ,5,3
MULDER: But you knew who your father was?  ,5,3
MULDER: And you believed that.  ,5,3
MULDER: You don't remember anything about that night?  ,5,3
"MULDER: I can help you. You were abducted, Samantha, I can help you to remember.  ",5,3
MULDER: Then why come here at all?  ,5,3
"MULDER: What you've been told ... I want you to listen to me, okay? What you've been told by that man may not be true.  ",5,3
MULDER: Because the man that brought you here has known where I've been for a very long time.  ,5,3
"MULDER: I don't know, but I think he's kept a lot of things from you.  ",5,3
"MULDER: Then I want you to come with me, come with me to see Mom.  ",5,3
MULDER: Yes. And I know she'd like to see you very much.  ,5,3
MULDER: Why not?  ,5,3
"MULDER: No, please, don't go.  ",5,3
"MULDER: Alright, just tell me how I can find you.  ",5,3
MULDER: Just ... just tell me where to find you.  ,5,3
"MULDER: We will do this on your time, just...  ",5,3
MULDER: What do you want from me?  ,5,3
"MULDER: You give me these things, the only things I ever wanted and I can't think of any reason for you to do so.  ",5,3
MULDER: I know the truth.  ,5,3
MULDER: I spoke to one of your men.  ,5,3
"MULDER: I've seen enough to know he's not a liar, yeah.  ",5,3
MULDER: What more can you show me?  ,5,3
MULDER: What are you saying?  ,5,3
MULDER: In exchange for what?  ,5,3
MULDER: No deal.  ,5,3
"MULDER: What have ... what have you given me? A claim of a cure for Scully, is she cured? You show me my sister only to take her right back. You've given me nothing!  ",5,3
"MULDER: You murdered my father, you killed Scully's sister, and if Scully dies, I will kill you. I don't care whose father you are, I will put you down.  ",5,3
MULDER: Where did you get that?  ,5,3
MULDER: Why am I here?  ,5,3
MULDER: The man was spying on me.  ,5,3
MULDER: I refuse to believe that.  ,5,3
MULDER: Can you show it to me?  ,5,3
MULDER: Name Skinner and save myself?  ,5,3
MULDER: I'll see you at the hearing. (They nod to each other)  ,5,3
MULDER: Good morning.  ,5,3
"MULDER: Yeah. I came by last night, but I... I didn't have the heart to wake you.  ",5,3
"MULDER: I was lost last night. But as I stood here, I thought I'd found my way. I've been ... ah .. I've been offered a deal, a deal that could save my life in a way. And though I'd refused the deal earlier, I left here last night with my mind made up to take it.  ",5,3
"MULDER: It doesn't matter, I'm not taking the deal, I'm not taking any deal. Not after what happened this morning.  ",5,3
"MULDER: Section Chief Blevins directed me to implicate Skinner. To name him as the man inside in the FBI. Who may have deceived us both. And if I name him, they'll protect me.  ",5,3
MULDER: No.  ,5,3
"MULDER: Yeah, they have evidence against me, they know I killed that man.  ",5,3
"MULDER: Scully, I can't let you take the blame. Because of your brother, because of your mother, and because I couldn't live with it. To live the lie, you have to believe it. Like these men who deceive us, who gave you this disease. We all have our faith, and mine is in the truth.  ",5,3
MULDER: (Huge heart- melting grin and laugh) Because I knew you'd talk me out of it if I was making a mistake. (The door opens and Scully's smile turns to kind of fear and she grabs Mulder's hand)  ,5,3
"MULDER: Have the Father say a few Hail Mulders for me, okay? (He kisses her on the cheek and leaves. She looks at Father McCue with mixed emotions)  ",5,3
MULDER: Sorry I'm late. (Senior agent sits. Mulder is now in the hot seat)  ,5,3
"MULDER: Respectfully, Sir. I've come here today to set the record straight so that this process you've begun came be completed and the guilty parties can be named. (Blevins is happy)  ",5,3
MULDER: I'm... ready to proceed please sir. (Mulder looks at Skinner. Skinner squirms and his eyes dart back and forth between Mulder and Blevins)  ,5,3
"MULDER: Four years ago, while working on an assignment outside the FBI mainstream, I was paired with Special Agent Dana Scully, who I believed was sent to spy on me. To debunk my investigations into the paranormal. That Agent Scully did not follow these orders is a testament to her integrity as an investigator, a scientist, and a human being. She has paid dearly for this integrity.  ",5,3
MULDER: She did lied because I asked her to. Because I had evidence of a conspiracy. A conspiracy against the American people.  ,5,3
"MULDER: AND a conspiracy intended to destroy the lives of those who would reveal it's true purpose. To conduct experiments on unwitting victims to further their secret agenda for someone further into the government operating at levels without restraint or responsibility. (Assassin has Cancerman in his sights as he walks through the courtyard) Without morals or conscience... Men who pretend to honor as they deceive.. The price of this betrayal, the lives and reputations of those deceived. Agent Scully... is now in a hospital bed ",5,3
MULDER: I will answer ,5,3
"MULDER: I will answer that question, Sir.  ",5,3
MULDER: I will answer the question after I name the man!  ,5,3
MULDER: I will answer that question after I name the man who's responsible for Agent Scully! The same man who directed that my apartment be surveilled by the DoD. A man I want to see prosecuted for his crimes! Who's sitting in this very room as I speak!  ,5,3
MULDER: I can't do that.  ,5,3
"MULDER: I can't do that sir, because the Section Chief is the man I'm about to name!  ",5,3
MULDER: How?  ,5,3
MULDER: Assuming?  ,5,3
MULDER: I didn't. I just guessed.  ,5,3
"MULDER: I'm sure whatever connections there were, they're being erased right now.  ",5,3
MULDER: Not everything. (He smiles) Scully's cancer's gone into remission.  ,5,3
MULDER: It's the best news I could have ever heard.  ,5,3
MULDER: I don't know. I don't think we'll ever know.  ,5,3
"MULDER: Yeah, she's in there with her family right now, but I'm sure she'd love to see you.  ",5,3
"MULDER: (in backseat with SCULLY, to SCULLY) Kill me now.  ",5,4
MULDER: (In hell) Im having that same problem right now.  ,5,4
"MULDER: No, you know unfortunately around this time of year I always develop a severe hemorrhoidal condition. (SCULLY tries not to laugh.)  ",5,4
"MULDER: (quietly) Thank you, Jesus.  ",5,4
"MULDER: No, Im sorry, Im not. Im just stretching my legs.  ",5,4
MULDER: Just slow down. I - I dont know what youre talking about.  ,5,4
"MULDER: Ill try to find out whos in charge, all right?  ",5,4
MULDER: My name is Fox Mulder. Im an agent with the FBI.  ,5,4
MULDER: (showing badge) Nobody. We just got stopped at your roadblock. It sounds like you had a shooting.  ,5,4
"MULDER: Well, what do you have evidence of?  ",5,4
MULDER: Separated by what?  ,5,4
MULDER: What kind of animal?  ,5,4
MULDER: Couldnt identify as the surveyors?  ,5,4
"MULDER: Oh, just, uh ... (SCULLY give him ""come on"" look.) Hold on a second.  ",5,4
MULDER: (to MICHELLE) What about the boys father?  ,5,4
MULDER: But no other sign of him? Do you have panther in these woods?  ,5,4
MULDER: But these tracks look like neither of those.  ,5,4
MULDER: You know of a good motel in the area?  ,5,4
"MULDER: Yeah. How do I say this without using any negative words, Scully?  ",5,4
"MULDER: Yeah, you see that? (Grabs her arms) We dont need that conference. We have communication like that, unspoken. You know what Im thinking.  ",5,4
MULDER: Its open. (SCULLY enters with tray of cheese and mini bottle of wine.) Who cut the cheese?  ,5,4
MULDER: Partaaayyy!  ,5,4
"MULDER: Try any of that Tailhook crap on me, Scully, Ill kick your ass. Pop quiz. What animal will attack the strongest leaving the weakest to escape? The answer is none. Not one of the over 4,000 species native to North America will attack the strongest when the weak is vulnerable.  ",5,4
MULDER: It makes me think that what were dealing with here is no ordinary predator.  ,5,4
MULDER: I think what we stumbled upon here is something more that what local authorities realize. The scenario described by that boy sound to me like a primitive culling technique.  ,5,4
MULDER: Those woods are as old as anything in the south and theres 800 square miles of them. Theres no telling whats alive out there. (Gets up to leave)  ,5,4
MULDER: I got to check something out.  ,5,4
"MULDER: Ill be back soon, and we can build a tower of furniture. (smile) Kay?  ",5,4
"MULDER: What is it, Louis?  ",5,4
MULDER: (to others) Be right back.  ,5,4
MULDER: Hes still freaked out.  ,5,4
MULDER: The Invisible Man was invisible.  ,5,4
"MULDER: Yeah, he said he was chased by a creature with glowing red eyes.  ",5,4
MULDER: Let me show you something. (Takes her to door.) Mrs. Asekoff said she went outside with the dog?  ,5,4
"MULDER: But when she came back, the door was locked from the inside.  ",5,4
MULDER: Look at this. We got some tracks here.  ,5,4
"MULDER: Here, and here .... dried mud against the tile, tracked in from the outside.  ",5,4
"MULDER: No, no. You see, uh, the ball of the foot here? A large foot and I count five toes.  ",5,4
"MULDER: Well, Im not saying it is. The weight distribution is all wrong. People walk heel to toe. Whatever this thing is it walks on the ball of its foot.  ",5,4
MULDER: No. My dad and I were Indian Guides. I know these things.  ,5,4
MULDER: (Shakes his head.)  ,5,4
MULDER: I found some tracks  right here.  ,5,4
"MULDER: Well, whatever it is, its attacked three grown men, presumably in broad daylight disposing of its prey without detection. And it wasnt shy last night about coming out of the woods to try again. What weve got here is a predator with low visibility and a high degree of motivation. And its got one advantage we dont have  the entire Apilachacola National Forest.  ",5,4
MULDER: By identifying it. Finding it before it finds somebody else.  ,5,4
MULDER: Thats pretty sophisticated for government issue. (MICHELLES body appears on the monitor.)  ,5,4
"MULDER: I dont think its a drifter, Scully, and we may be looking for two individuals.  ",5,4
"MULDER: Well, that thing lured that woman out of the house last night to separate her from her son.  ",5,4
"MULDER: Divide and conquer. If your enemy has greater numbers than you, you divide and conquer it to diminish those numbers.  ",5,4
MULDER: Encroaching development. Thats what I suspected when I went to check on Louis and his mother.  ,5,4
"MULDER: That survey team was staking out a new 100,000 acre plot. Civilization is pushing very hard into these woods. Maybe something in these woods is pushing back.  ",5,4
MULDER: Where is it?  ,5,4
MULDER: I dont see it.  ,5,4
MULDER: Scully!!  ,5,4
MULDER: (voice) Scully!  ,5,4
MULDER: What happened?  ,5,4
MULDER: They separated us. That was on purpose. They divided us so they could go after her. She was in the lead and presumably the strongest. They take the strongest first.  ,5,4
MULDER: Youre right. We got to find her.  ,5,4
MULDER: I dont know! Well form a line and beat the bushes. Maybe youll pick up a signal.  ,5,4
"MULDER: The longer we wait, the less chance we have of finding her.  ",5,4
MULDER: Okay. Youre right. You go back. You leave me the FLIR and you go back.  ,5,4
MULDER: We have to find her.  ,5,4
MULDER: (pause) All right. We all go then. (to Jeff) You lead the way.  ,5,4
MULDER: So far all its done is split us up.  ,5,4
MULDER: What does that tell you?  ,5,4
MULDER: Mm hmm.  ,5,4
MULDER: Maybe it can regulate its temperature. Do you know of any animal that can?  ,5,4
MULDER: Thats interesting.  ,5,4
"MULDER: 30 years ago, the, uh, the town of Point Pleasant, West Virginia was terrorized for over a year by something  killing livestock and terrorizing the people. Witnesses described them as primitive looking men with red piercing eyes. Became known as the ""moth men."" Ive got an X-File dating back to 1952 on it.  ",5,4
"MULDER: No, ""The Cockroach That Ate Cincinnati"" is in the Cs. ""Moth Mens"" over in the Ms.  ",5,4
MULDER: This is the same path. This is the way we came.  ,5,4
MULDER: Thats because youve had your nose glued to that screen the whole time.  ,5,4
MULDER: Where?  ,5,4
MULDER: Jeff?  ,5,4
MULDER: Where?  ,5,4
MULDER: Where?  ,5,4
"MULDER: Scully, I lost it.  ",5,4
MULDER: Did you hit it?  ,5,4
MULDER: Wheres Glaser?  ,5,4
MULDER: How many shots did you fire?  ,5,4
MULDER: Is that your only clip?  ,5,4
MULDER: Dont fire again unless youre sure youre gonna hit it. It may be trying to spend our advantage.  ,5,4
"MULDER: I dont know. But what ever it is, its smarter than us  at least out here.  ",5,4
MULDER: (voice in pain) Scully! Scully!  ,5,4
MULDER: Scully!  ,5,4
MULDER: Indian Guide says maybe you should run to the store and get some matches.  ,5,4
MULDER: What are you doing.  ,5,4
MULDER: Oh. And maybe itll start raining weenies and marshmallows.  ,5,4
MULDER: No. Yes ... actually. Yeah.  ,5,4
MULDER: I was told once that the best way to regenerate body heat was to crawl naked into a sleeping bag with some body else whos already naked. (Snuggles closer.)  ,5,4
"MULDER: Yeah, once, when I was at the Ice Capades.  ",5,4
"MULDER: I think Nature is supremely indifferent to whether we live or die. I mean, if youre lucky you get 75 years. If youre really lucky you get 80 years. And if youre extraordinarily lucky, you get to have 50 of those years with a decent head of hair.  ",5,4
"MULDER: Go, girl.  ",5,4
"MULDER: Hey, who did you identify with when you were a kid? Wilma or Betty?  ",5,4
"MULDER: Yes! I did, too.  ",5,4
MULDER: But where are they today?  ,5,4
MULDER: (nods) Yeah. But there seem to be only two of them.  ,5,4
MULDER: I dont wanna wrestle.  ,5,4
"MULDER: One of us has got to stay awake, Scully.  ",5,4
"MULDER: If you get tired, you wake me.  ",5,4
MULDER: Why dont you sing .. something.  ,5,4
"MULDER: Well, if you sing something, Ill know youre awake.  ",5,4
MULDER: It doesnt matter. Just sing anything.  ,5,4
MULDER: Chorus.  ,5,4
MULDER: Scully?!  ,5,4
MULDER: What are you doing?  ,5,4
MULDER: I wouldnt go far.  ,5,4
MULDER: Scully? (gets up and goes to where she was) Scully? Scully! Scully!?  ,5,4
MULDER: Where?  ,5,4
MULDER: You all right?  ,5,4
MULDER: Whats down there?  ,5,4
"MULDER: Scully, whats going on? Are you okay?  ",5,4
MULDER: Is she alive?  ,5,4
MULDER: Is there a way out?  ,5,4
MULDER: Yeah?  ,5,4
"MULDER: Hold on, Im going to drop my gun down.  ",5,4
"MULDER: (Holding his shoulder, rolling on ground in pain.) Dont mind me.  ",5,4
MULDER: (rising) Scully!  ,5,4
MULDER: Too bad we dont have any office furniture.  ,5,4
"MULDER: Go, team. 20 more bodies and well win the Honey-Baked Ham.  ",5,4
MULDER: Were down here!  ,5,4
MULDER: Weve got injured people down here.  ,5,4
"MULDER: No, on the contrary, Agent Kinsley, we would never have gotten involved in this if not for you.  ",5,4
"MULDER: (looking at a tab on the crosscut - 1521 Ponce De Leon Lands Looking for Fountain Of Youth ) Yeah, you see this?  ",5,4
MULDER: There was something in the cave that Scully fell into ; an inscription - Ad Noctum.  ,5,4
"MULDER: It means ""into darkness"". The Spanish Conquistadors used to carve it on the posts that they would lash the natives to as a warning.  ",5,4
MULDER: Ponce De Leon came here 450 years ago looking for the Fountain Of Youth.  ,5,4
MULDER: After 400 years in the woods dont you think they might have adapted perfectly to their environment?  ,5,4
MULDER: Why do you say that?  ,5,4
MULDER: I wouldnt be surprised if they couldnt find either one of them.  ,5,4
"MULDER: These predators have been in these woods for a long, long time. They would have perceived any encroachment on their territory as an enemy, even a little kid like that.  ",5,4
"MULDER: (nods, then looks around) Wheres Agent Scully?  ",5,4
MULDER: She did? Excuse me. (Runs to KINSLEYS car and drives off.)  ,5,4
MULDER: Scully!? Scully!!!??  ,5,4
"MULDER: (Entering his room, getting his suitcase) Lets get out of here.  ",5,4
MULDER: You pack everything?  ,5,4
MULDER: Hello? (No answer) Hello? (Scully doesn't say anything.) Hello? (Scully hangs up)  ,5,5
"MULDER: Scully, do you think its too soon to get my own 1-900 number?  ",5,6
MULDER: No. It had something called hypertrechosis lanuginosa. Its a rare hereditary condition most commonly found in some South American families.  ,5,6
MULDER: Mrs. Berkowitz had a tubal ligation two years ago.  ,5,6
MULDER: (leaning down to examine the marks) Mmm.  ,5,6
MULDER: Why do you say that?  ,5,6
"MULDER: Well, I dont think this has anything to do with alien abductions. I dont even know if I believe in that stuff anymore.  ",5,6
MULDER: (Holds up comic book.) The Great Mutato  ,5,6
MULDER: You think baloney would be more effective?  ,5,6
"MULDER: Im not humoring them, Scully. This is a very serious crime.  ",5,6
MULDER: For the purpose of what?  ,5,6
MULDER: I am alarmed that you would reduce these people to a cultural stereotype. Not everybodys dream is to get on Jerry Springer.  ,5,6
"MULDER: But nonetheless, unverifiable, and therefore true in the sense that theyre believed to be true.  ",5,6
MULDER: Shh.  ,5,6
MULDER: I dont know. I lost it.  ,5,6
MULDER: There. Up there.  ,5,6
MULDER: Were with the FBI.  ,5,6
MULDER: Your father.  ,5,6
MULDER: What is the Homeotic Hox gene?  ,5,6
MULDER: (looking at very strange image of a deformed fly) This fly has legs   ,5,6
MULDER: Why would you do that?  ,5,6
MULDER: Could that be done in humans?  ,5,6
MULDER: But could it be done?  ,5,6
"MULDER: (to SCULLY) Good night, Dr. Frankenstein.  ",5,6
MULDER: Thats not what I just heard.  ,5,6
"MULDER: Well, then why do them at all?  ",5,6
"MULDER: But, given the power, who could resist the temptation to create life in his own image?  ",5,6
"MULDER: I -Id just like some coffee, thanks.  ",5,6
"MULDER: Do you own a tape recorder, Izzy?  ",5,6
MULDER: Thats the same voice we heard out in the woods last night.  ,5,6
MULDER: (holding tape) To messenger this to the Bureau. I want special audio to filter the tracks and then I want to go back to see the professor.  ,5,6
"MULDER: Something recorded its voice on this, Scully.  ",5,6
"MULDER: When Victor Frankenstein asks himself ""Whence did the principle of life proceed?"" and then as a gratifying summit to his toils creates a hideous phantasm of a man he prefigures the Postmodern Prometheus. The genetic engineer whose power to reanimate matter  genes into life  us  is only as limited as his imagination is.  ",5,6
MULDER: Who else would go to such trouble to impregnate Shaineh Berkowitz?  ,5,6
"MULDER: Mrs. Berkowitz said in her letter that when she saw her intruder there was a gaseous white cloud and then when she woke up three days later, nobody knew that shed been gone.  ",5,6
MULDER: Dr. Pollidori. Is there something youd like to tell us?  ,5,6
MULDER: Im accusing that your wife may have been impregnated.  ,5,6
"MULDER: Oh, I think you know. (Stands up dramatically, but falls back against the stove rattling pans. Very funny.)  ",5,6
MULDER: (holds a frying pan) Scully?  ,5,6
"MULDER: The other victims, they had their frying pans  violated. (Indicates residue on bottom of frying pan. SCULLY examines it.) Do you know what that is? (MULDER stumbles back against the garbage can.)  ",5,6
MULDER: (dramatically) I think we found our smoking gun.  ,5,6
MULDER: (also sarcastic) Not a problem.  ,5,6
MULDER: (looking at disgusting eggs) Whats this?  ,5,6
MULDER: (looking away) Sure.  ,5,6
MULDER: Whoa! Thats not a place you want to burn a guy.  ,5,6
MULDER: They unmasked the monster.  ,5,6
MULDER: Used by who?  ,5,6
MULDER: Is there someone registered locally?  ,5,6
MULDER: We may be too late. I think we are. (Hears a noise overhead. He and SCULLY both draw guns.) Whos that? Show yourself!  ,5,6
MULDER: Who are you?  ,5,6
MULDER: Whats your business here?  ,5,6
MULDER: Its alive.  ,5,6
"MULDER: Whatever you have in mind, Im going to have to ask you to stop right there.  ",5,6
"MULDER: Hey, Scully. Look at this.  ",5,6
MULDER: Youre going to have to come out of there.  ,5,6
MULDER: I hope not.  ,5,6
"MULDER: Were going to have to get him out of here, Scully. Theyre going to kill him.  ",5,6
MULDER: Created by whom?  ,5,6
MULDER: Quiet.  ,5,6
"MULDER: (shaking his head) This is all wrong, Scully. This is not how the story is supposed to end.  ",5,6
"MULDER: Dr. Frankenstein pays for his evil ambitions, yes. But the monsters supposed to escape to go search for his bride.  ",5,6
"MULDER: Well, wheres the writer? (IZZY enters) I want to speak to the writer.  ",5,6
"MULDER: Excuse me, I'm looking for the special needs ward. (She motions.)  ",5,7
MULDER: Thanks. (He walks past the children and a playground to the door.)  ,5,7
MULDER: What are you coloring?  ,5,7
MULDER: Have you ever seen Mr. Potato head? He looks like this. (Give a pretty goofy impersonation of Mr. Potato head that has to be seen to be believed. Got a smile out of her.) Doesn't it? (Emily nods. Mulder notices Emily's wearing Scully's cross necklace.)  ,5,7
MULDER: I found Emily's surrogate mother. I had Frohike hack into the California Social Services Adoption database.  ,5,7
"MULDER: Yeah, her mother of record is one Anna Fugazzi.  ",5,7
"MULDER: Yeah, as in slang term for fake.  ",5,7
MULDER: Because there are no true records. Emily didn't come into this world through any system that keeps them.  ,5,7
MULDER: Have you asked yourself that?  ,5,7
"MULDER: Someone, who's proven that they'll do anything to protect her or their interest in her.  ",5,7
"MULDER: Yeah, but who's going to protect you? Emily's adoptive parents are both dead, by no accident.  ",5,7
MULDER: Why didn't you call me sooner?  ,5,7
MULDER: And I should have declined... if I never want to see you hurt or harmed in any way.  ,5,7
"MULDER: Because I know something that I haven't said... Something that they'll use against you to jeopardize your custody of Emily. No matter how much you love this little girl, she's a miracle that was never meant to be, Scully.  ",5,7
"MULDER: She was missing for 4 weeks, that's documented in the file.  ",5,7
"MULDER: Yes, all of them. (Scully is stunned.)  ",5,7
"MULDER: I believe it can, and was. That Emily Sim was conceived as a result of those experiments.  ",5,7
MULDER: I don't know how else to explain it. A medical exam of Ms. Scully would show that she hasn't given birth.  ,5,7
MULDER: I included this information in anticipation of your reaction and how it might look if you received this information without any explanation.  ,5,7
"MULDER: No, but the fact remains, Ms. Scully is the mother of this child.  ",5,7
"MULDER: Well, if you can show me a legal precedent for this case, I'd like to see it.  Dana has known for quite some time that she can't bear children. She doesn't know why, but however that happened, that fact that she can adopt this child, her own flesh and blood, is something I don't feel I have the right to question and I don't believe anyone has the right to stand in the way of.  ",5,7
MULDER: When's she due?  ,5,7
MULDER: I never expected this. I thought I was protecting you.  ,5,7
"MULDER: I only know that genetic experiments were being done, that children were being created.  ",5,7
MULDER: For who? For what? I don't know. (The phone rings. Scully answers it.)  ,5,7
MULDER: (whispering) I need to trace a call. I have an incoming call to residential line 555-0380.  ,5,7
"MULDER: (to Scully) Don't hang up. (Into phone) Okay, thanks. I got a trace. County Children's Center.  ",5,7
MULDER: Anyone been here the last half hour?  ,5,7
MULDER: Scully? There's something on her neck. (Scully lower the back of her nightgown and pushes her hair aside.)  ,5,7
"MULDER: All right, I'll try back later. (He walks to Scully.) I spoke to the social worker.  She hasn't been able to reach Emily's doctor. (One doctor comes out of the room.)  ",5,7
MULDER: Do you know what that is?  ,5,7
"MULDER: Wait! Stop! (She puts the needle in, Emily flinches) Move away from her! Get away from her!  ",5,7
MULDER: She still sleeping?  ,5,7
MULDER: The ER doctor is in and out of consciousness.  ,5,7
"MULDER: If Emily was someone's creation, then it occurred to me that she might share the same body chemistry that we've seen before. So I had them put the ER doctor in a cooling bath like you did when I was exposed to this.  ",5,7
MULDER: She was also being treated. (Doctor enters.)  ,5,7
"MULDER: Yeah, but it's not beyond Dr. Calderon.  ",5,7
MULDER: What can I say to convince you?  ,5,7
"MULDER: So, I'm wasting your time.  This isn't worth the life of a three year old girl.  ",5,7
"MULDER: Okay then. (Mulder holds on to his hand and turns it causing Calderon to flop down on a table.  Mulder picks him up and starts slapping him) How do you feel now? (He slams him on the floor. Calderon yells for help. Mulder kicks him on the side and picks him up and thrusts him against the wall.) Why don't you tell me what your company's really in the business of.  Huh? Abducting women and stealing their unborn children? Medical rapists! That's all you are!  You don't care if that little girl dies!  She's just a lab rat to you! (He pulls out his gun and points it in Calderon's face.) Tell me, whose life is worth saving, yours or hers? I want everything to help that little girl! (A door opens, it's security. The whole office is looking through the door, wondering what the hell's going on. Mulder pockets his gun and walks out) I'll be back.  ",5,7
MULDER: Yeah.  ,5,7
MULDER: I'm following Dr. Calderon.  ,5,7
MULDER: Is she all right?  ,5,7
MULDER: Whatever he injected her with I don't think he meant to harm her.  ,5,7
MULDER: I think Dr. Calderon went there to treat her.  ,5,7
"MULDER: As a bluff. I don't think they want her dead either, Scully, but for different reasons. Look, I'm going to catch up with you, all right? (He hangs up. Scully does too. She looks at Kresge.)  ",5,7
MULDER: Anna Fugazzi?  ,5,7
MULDER: Your name is Anna Fugazzi?  ,5,7
"MULDER: No, I'm not.  Is that your real name?  ",5,7
MULDER: Not until now.  ,5,7
MULDER: Evelyn Burmeister. (Cut to Frohike who enters the name into a search engine.)  ,5,7
MULDER: That makes 8 for 8.  ,5,7
MULDER: No I'm at the maternity ward.  ,5,7
MULDER: I think you might have a shot here Frohike.  Do you know anything about pharmaceuticals?  ,5,7
MULDER: There's two prescriptions on their med charts that all these women have in common. Abbreviated PMZ 200 and Duratab.  ,5,7
MULDER: Hormones.  ,5,7
MULDER: You would these. Anna? There's a doctor that comes to visit you. a Dr. Calderon.  ,5,7
"MULDER: No, actually, I'm looking for him.  ",5,7
MULDER: Your beauty sleep. What is that?  ,5,7
MULDER: Who are you?  ,5,7
"MULDER: Detective Kresge, I'm Agent Fox Mulder with the FBI. (A door opens. They both look. Calderon walks into the hallway.) Take the gun off me and put it on that man. (Calderon walks toward them. Kresge points the gun at Calderon who walks toward them)  ",5,7
"MULDER: Run. Get out of here. (Mulder is ready to go, but waits for Kresge, who drops the vials to put both hands on the gun. The vials drop to the floor and scatter.) Don't use your gun. Get out of here!  ",5,7
MULDER: Kresge...  ,5,7
"MULDER: Don't fire, Kresge! (He does.  The bullets go right through Calderon. Green oozes out of the holes. Mulder runs down the hallway. Calderon never falls. He turns around and faces Kresge. (Kresge's eyes start to water. He tries to hold the gun on him. He drops the gun, gasps and grabs his eyes)  ",5,7
MULDER: I'm an FBI agent. I have an emergency situation. I need an ambulance and I need backup.  ,5,7
MULDER: I don't know where I am. (Kresge clone leaves the house.)  ,5,7
MULDER: You have your weapon.  ,5,7
MULDER: I have back up coming. I need a location though.  ,5,7
MULDER: Detective Kresge is going to radio in the location. (Mulder hears the car alarm of the Land Rover beep off. He turns to see Kresge drive away in the Land Rover.)  ,5,7
MULDER: But if you could treat her...  ,5,7
MULDER: Are you sure?  ,5,7
MULDER: I think she was born to... serve an agenda.  ,5,7
MULDER: All right. I'll stay with you.  ,5,7
MULDER: I don't know. But the fact that you found her... and had a chance to love her... Then maybe she was meant for that too.  ,5,7
MULDER: So you could save her.  ,5,7
MULDER: He's doing better. He's already out of the ICU.  ,5,7
"MULDER: They've already cleaned up the nursing home. All the women have been placed in new homes. There's no evidence that anyone at Transgen Corporation knew of Calderon's work. (Scully looks at Mulder, then back to the coffin.)  ",5,7
"MULDER: The subject's name is Robert Patrick Modell. He's a serial killer responsible for at least 17 murders. Specifically, he targets law enforcement. In 1996, he caused the deaths of an FBI agent and a Loudoun County sheriff's deputy. It was all a game to him. He was looking for, in his words, ""a worthy adversary"".  ",5,8
MULDER: We fully expect him to pick up exactly where he left off.  ,5,8
"MULDER: Modell refers to himself as ""pusher"". Technically speaking, all of his victims' wounds were self-inflicted. This man has a unique ability to force his will upon others - to push his victims into hurting or killing themselves.  ",5,8
"MULDER: OK, look, this is all you need to know. Do not trust this man, do not talk to him, do not engage him in conversation, even if he is unarmed. Approach him only with extraordinary caution, and then only with adequate backup.  ",5,8
MULDER: Adequate backup? Every cop you can lay your hands on.  ,5,8
MULDER: What's Modell's condition?  ,5,8
MULDER: Oh yeah?  ,5,8
MULDER: How did he recover?  ,5,8
MULDER: What about his brain tumor that was supposed to be killing him?  ,5,8
MULDER: Is there anybody on staff here we can talk to?  ,5,8
MULDER: As opposed to what? What's your point?  ,5,8
MULDER: Who?  ,5,8
MULDER: Did Modell ever get any other visitors besides the Little Sisters of Charity?  ,5,8
MULDER: Sounds like you got to know him pretty well.  ,5,8
MULDER: About what?  ,5,8
MULDER: He's a very considerate man.  ,5,8
MULDER: (to phone) Yeah.  ,5,8
"MULDER: I don't feel like playing your game right now, Modell.  ",5,8
"MULDER: Tell it to me in person, Modell.  ",5,8
"MULDER: No, you listen to me. Either you come back here on your own or I drag your sorry ass back on the bumper of my car.  ",5,8
MULDER: Outside!  ,5,8
MULDER: (motioning at the symbols) I'm going to take a wild stab here and guess this is a clue.  ,5,8
"MULDER: That's a little on the nose, don't you think?  ",5,8
MULDER: Was Nathan Bowman married?  ,5,8
"MULDER: Linda. Bet that's his wife, huh?  ",5,8
"MULDER: (to phone) Hi, Linda?  ",5,8
MULDER: Do you know the name of the client that Mrs. Bowman went to see?  ,5,8
"MULDER: Do you know where Mrs. Bowman went to meet Fox Mulder, a location?  ",5,8
MULDER: Yeah.  ,5,8
MULDER: Linda Bowman? Fox Mulder.  ,5,8
MULDER: Not since 6:00 this morning.  ,5,8
MULDER: Why didn't Modell just kill those two cops? What was to stop him?  ,5,8
MULDER: As in too tired?  ,5,8
MULDER: Maybe. I don't know. Something's just not making sense. (to a marshall) Can I borrow your radio?  ,5,8
"MULDER: (to radio) Scully, I got him. Come quick.  ",5,8
"MULDER: (to radio) North side of Channel, second floor. Some kind of company, some engineering company.  ",5,8
"MULDER: Shut up, Modell.  ",5,8
MULDER: I said shut up.  ,5,8
"MULDER: Shut up or I will shoot you, you son of a bitch.  ",5,8
"MULDER: I will shoot you, shut up.  ",5,8
MULDER: I will shoot you.  ,5,8
MULDER: He had to go.  ,5,8
"MULDER: Well, aside from the utter grinding humiliation that comes from knowing I let our suspect go, pretty good.  ",5,8
"MULDER: No, actually it couldn't have. I didn't find Modell. He sought me out. He wanted me to hear his message.  ",5,8
"MULDER: ""Don't play the game.""  ",5,8
MULDER: I don't think so. I'm not even sure he's playing a game.  ,5,8
"MULDER: Then why didn't he kill the cops? Or the prison guards? Or, hell, while we're at it, why didn't he kill me? Why didn't he make me eat a bullet out of my own gun? He could have.  ",5,8
"MULDER: Yeah, he was definitely there, but that doesn't prove that he did it.  ",5,8
MULDER: It's not like that.  ,5,8
"MULDER: Modell is involved. He's related to it somehow, but not the way you think.  ",5,8
"MULDER: Yeah, that's my opinion.  ",5,8
MULDER: What do we still agree on here? That Modell was pursuing Linda Bowman? I'd like to know why.  ,5,8
MULDER: We appreciate your help.  ,5,8
MULDER: Yes.  ,5,8
MULDER: How long did you know him?  ,5,8
"MULDER: No, you don't.  ",5,8
MULDER: He was true blue. (Linda Bowman nods) Thank you.  ,5,8
MULDER: She killed Nathan Bowman.  ,5,8
MULDER: Modell was there but for some other reason. She killed her husband.  ,5,8
"MULDER: Wait a minute, just hear me out. Her husband's brush with greatness, she doesn't want to paint him as being impulsive. Who the hell talks like that?  ",5,8
"MULDER: She was waving it under our nose, she was playing with us. Modell told me, he warned me not to play the game. I think it was her game he was talking about.  ",5,8
MULDER: Has she asked how her husband was murdered? Has she shown any interest in the details? An escaped serial killer is supposedly stalking her. Does she seem particularly fearful to you?  ,5,8
"MULDER: You heard it in there, Scully.  ",5,8
MULDER: But what if she can do what Modell does?  ,5,8
MULDER: You think I should go home?  ,5,8
MULDER: Who are you afraid I'm gonna point it at?  ,5,8
MULDER: I'll prove it.  ,5,8
MULDER: (annoyed) Go fetch her some water!  ,5,8
"MULDER: No, just anything at all that you might recall. Did he ever talk about his past? You know, mention anybody special, a woman, something like that.  ",5,8
MULDER: Anything remarkable he ever said that you can remember.  ,5,8
MULDER: Yeah? What was that?  ,5,8
MULDER: Was this the same nun that visited him the day before he escaped?  ,5,8
MULDER: How many times did she visit him?  ,5,8
"MULDER: Would you take a look at something for me? Is that the woman, is that the nun?  ",5,8
MULDER: Here ... glasses.  ,5,8
MULDER: Where did you leave them?  ,5,8
MULDER: No!  ,5,8
MULDER: I need help in here!  ,5,8
MULDER: Help!  ,5,8
"MULDER: (on phone) Hey, Scully, it's me.  ",5,8
MULDER: I'm at the prison.  ,5,8
"MULDER: It's a little late for that now. Modell's therapist just electrocuted herself right in front of me, and she was on the phone when she did it.  ",5,8
MULDER: It was Linda Bowman.  ,5,8
MULDER: The therapist would have identified her and verified that she visited Modell in the prison.  ,5,8
"MULDER: Listen, Scully, just trace the call and cut off any access that woman has to a phone. I'm heading back there right now.  ",5,8
MULDER: You're not?  ,5,8
MULDER: Why isn't anybody picking up at the safe house switchboard?  ,5,8
MULDER: What happened?  ,5,8
MULDER: What happened?  ,5,8
MULDER: He pointed a gun at you?  ,5,8
MULDER: He said to you that he had a gun.  ,5,8
MULDER: Modell was unarmed. He purposely drew Skinner's fire.  ,5,8
MULDER: To protect someone.  ,5,8
MULDER: To take the fall for her.  ,5,8
MULDER: Where is she?  ,5,8
"MULDER: No, it's not.  ",5,8
"MULDER: If Modell makes it through surgery, I want to be the first person that he talks to.  ",5,8
"MULDER: (annoyed) OK, look, you do me a favor, Scully. You give me a call when you think I've come to my senses, all right?  ",5,8
"MULDER: Call me if he wakes up, please.  ",5,8
"MULDER: Scully, what are you doing here?  ",5,8
MULDER: Scully.  ,5,8
MULDER: Where is she?  ,5,8
MULDER: (shouts) Linda Bowman!  ,5,8
MULDER: (shouts) Show yourself!  ,5,8
MULDER: (running toward her) No! No!  ,5,8
"MULDER: (to ""Linda Bowman"", pointing the weapon at her) I'm gonna kill you!  ",5,8
MULDER: What?  ,5,8
MULDER: What the hell are you talking about?  ,5,8
MULDER: You killed her!  ,5,8
MULDER: (shouting) Shut up!  ,5,8
MULDER: Shut up!  ,5,8
MULDER: Shut up!  ,5,8
MULDER: I think that covers it.  ,5,8
MULDER: How's that?  ,5,8
MULDER: I almost killed my partner.  ,5,8
MULDER: Then how come I feel like I lost?  ,5,8
MULDER: All that came out of his stomach?  ,5,9
"MULDER: Is it possible that he took the term ""mud pie"" literally?  ",5,9
MULDER: Is that what youve concluded?  ,5,9
"MULDER: Well, according to the same report the coroner had to hire a backhoe to remove the body, which was buried completely in a standing vertical position.  ",5,9
MULDER: That was some rainstorm.  ,5,9
"MULDER: Now that sounds like an exaggeration, dont you think?  ",5,9
"MULDER: How a 64"" 250-pound man was buried alive in less than five minutes by a 16-year-old kid whose classmates lovingly refer to as ""Dork-weed?""  ",5,9
"MULDER: (looking at one of BOBBYs posters) ""Ich bin ein auslander."" ""I am an outsider."" You know, when Kennedy told the Germans ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" he was actually saying ""I am a cocktail sausage.""  ",5,9
"MULDER: (after a second of ""Oh, man, Im old"" realization) Im not  Im not here to accuse you of anything, Bobby.  ",5,9
MULDER: I want to hear your story.  ,5,9
"MULDER: Well, the police arent entirely convinced that thats the truth.  ",5,9
"MULDER: Right. But you see, youre not making it very easy for them to believe otherwise. You understand that?  ",5,9
MULDER: Did he ever hurt you?  ,5,9
MULDER: Did you ever shove him back?  ,5,9
MULDER: Thats why some people thought you might have dug the hole. Or attacked him when he fell in the hole because he was down there.  ,5,9
MULDER: You remember what was going through your head at the time?  ,5,9
MULDER: So he pounds the kid. And the kid pounds back. Is that what she told you?  ,5,9
MULDER: Kid says his stepfather teed off on him regularly.  ,5,9
"MULDER: No, thats his explanation. He says hes innocent.  ",5,9
MULDER: I think hes a hard kid to love.  ,5,9
MULDER: Im still finding it hard to reconcile the facts with the physical evidence.  ,5,9
"MULDER: Well, then how did the victim swallow 12 pounds of this stuff?  ",5,9
MULDER: Did you ask if anybody else might be involved?  ,5,9
MULDER: That could be me.  ,5,9
MULDER: What is it?  ,5,9
MULDER: Who was it?  ,5,9
MULDER: Karin Matthews?  ,5,9
MULDER: Physical violence?  ,5,9
MULDER: Was his stepfather ever involved?  ,5,9
MULDER: So youre saying Bobby would have good reason to kill his father.  ,5,9
"MULDER: Youre free not to answer, Miss Matthews  or youre free to make these vague allusions  but your evasiveness is only going to land this kid in jail for a long, long time.  ",5,9
MULDER: You make it sound like a justification. Like Bobby did it. And I dont think he did.  ,5,9
MULDER: Did you get a look at the body?  ,5,9
MULDER: Pushed out?  ,5,9
MULDER: About what?  ,5,9
MULDER: Was Lisa another of you clients?  ,5,9
MULDER: Yeah.  ,5,9
MULDER: What were you treating her for?  ,5,9
MULDER: Have you asked her what happened?  ,5,9
MULDER: We gather that she had a fight with her father over Bobby Rich.  ,5,9
MULDER: Had you counseled her father?  ,5,9
MULDER: In what ways?  ,5,9
MULDER: Seems to be working.  ,5,9
MULDER: Does she think Bobby did it?  ,5,9
MULDER: I think were all quite capable.  ,5,9
"MULDER: Come here. (SCULLY joins him at the broken window.) Take a look at this. If Lisas father was pushed out, then all the glass would be outside. Look. Theres glass here on the inside. The paint on the mullions is cracked on the outside, not on the inside here.  ",5,9
"MULDER: Well, seems to me like some facts have been assumed. It looks to me like Lisas father was pulled out the window, not pushed.  ",5,9
MULDER: That I dont know.  ,5,9
MULDER: Thats my point exactly.  ,5,9
"MULDER: Yeah, but there was a substantial amount of blood loss, wasnt there?  ",5,9
MULDER: Have you determined if the neck injury was caused by the fall?  ,5,9
MULDER: Have you seen this? What do you make of this here?  ,5,9
MULDER: Scully?  ,5,9
MULDER: (pointing to the word on the bag) Evidence.  ,5,9
MULDER: (quietly) No. I think hes scared enough as it is.  ,5,9
MULDER: That splinter youre holding came from Mr. Baiocchis neck but it didnt come from the broken window.  ,5,9
"MULDER: Its greenwood, fresh from a living tree.  ",5,9
MULDER: Excuse me. Its been a few years.  ,5,9
"MULDER: Kind of begs the question, doesnt it? (up in the tree) Hey, Scully, is this demonstration of boyish agility turning you on at all?  ",5,9
MULDER: (from the tree) Scully.  ,5,9
MULDER: (from the tree) Scully   ,5,9
MULDER: What causes this?  ,5,9
"MULDER: Ms. Matthews, wed like to ask you a few questions.  ",5,9
MULDER: Your fathers death. We need to clarify a few details.  ,5,9
"MULDER: Yeah, under rather curious circumstances. His body was pulled from the mud of an orchard?  ",5,9
"MULDER: Well, we thought it was strange that you didnt bother to mention it.  ",5,9
"MULDER: We spoke to someone who thinks it does. Someone who worked for you father? According to the orchard man, Your fathers death brought about the end of a blight affecting the trees.  ",5,9
MULDER: Im not expecting it to be.  ,5,9
"MULDER: I dont think this was an act of grave robbing, Scully. (puts shovel in trunk of car)  ",5,9
MULDER: More like an act of nature.  ,5,9
MULDER: The orchard man said that the blight that plagues this town was caused by a man  implying a connection.  ,5,9
"MULDER: Between the people of this valley and their livelihood : the trees. Look at the victims, Scully.  ",5,9
"MULDER: And Karins father, 20 years ago: all men who worked in these orchards -- their lives and deaths tied to these trees. We removed a sliver of greenwood from Lisas fathers neck. And the bruise that you found on Bobbys fathers ankle could have been caused by a root -- The same root system that pulled Karins father from his grave.  ",5,9
MULDER: Who couldnt defend themselves.  ,5,9
MULDER: Something did it for them  or someone controlling nature. Karin said she was counseling Bobby and Lisa to empower them. I think we should talk to them.  ,5,9
MULDER: Then we should talk to Bobby.  ,5,9
MULDER: Maybe we havent asked him the right question.  ,5,9
"MULDER: Yes, you do. Maybe you hated your stepfather, but you didnt kill him. You dont have it in you.  ",5,9
"MULDER: No. You cant go until you tell me the truth. For the first time in your life people are taking you seriously and I think they should take you seriously. I think youre a serious kid. Not an outsider anymore, huh?  ",5,9
"MULDER: Why dont you give it up? Why dont you tell me what happened that night? You took the shovel to him, but you couldnt do it, so you ran, you ran to the orchard, but not because you dug a hole or laid a trap --  ",5,9
"MULDER:  because you were afraid, not of Phil.  ",5,9
"MULDER: You werent afraid of Phil Phil never hit you or hurt you in that way. In fact, I think you wanted to help Phil.  ",5,9
"MULDER: You wanted to save him. You didnt want Phil to die, did you?  ",5,9
"MULDER: What were you afraid of, Bobby?  ",5,9
MULDER: Couldnt do what?  ,5,9
MULDER: She who?  ,5,9
MULDER: Karin made you what?  ,5,9
"MULDER: She made you believe you were a victim but you werent, were you?  ",5,9
MULDER: Karin?  ,5,9
MULDER: Scully. Take a look at this.  ,5,9
MULDER: Talk about putting down roots.  ,5,9
MULDER: I think were looking at Karin Matthews father.  ,5,9
MULDER: The same way Bobbys father got pulled down into that mud.  ,5,9
"MULDER: This has to do with Karin, with her own fathers abuse. It was never Bobby that was locked in the cellar. Karin was. Karin caused all this.  ",5,9
MULDER: I think shes the killer and the victim.  ,5,9
MULDER: Lisa  Wheres Karin.  ,5,9
"MULDER: You stay with her, Scully.  ",5,9
MULDER: Karin! Stop!  ,5,9
MULDER: Stand up to him!  ,5,9
"MULDER: (trying to keep BOBBY from sinking into the mud, to KARIN) Make him stop, Karin! Tell him what you should have told him 20 years ago. Youre not going to take it anymore.  ",5,9
"MULDER: Coats Grove authorities conducted a detailed examination of the soil and root composition in the Rich family orchard, but could not explain what pulled Karin Matthews body into the Michigan mud. Nor could the authorities determine how the body of Karins father was pulled from its grave into her root cellar three years earlier. While the forensic data is inconclusive, I believe the explanation lies in hospital records dating back to Karins childhood, which suggests that she, herself was a victim of abuse.  ",5,9
"MULDER: (voiceover) Abuse exists, as does the blindness that accompanies it. The pleading cries in the night followed by the disturbing denial of culpability: ""If something bad happened, I didnt see it."" As witness to a horrific event, I am forced to question the frequently blurred line between right and wrong to weigh the guilt of one mans act against anothers to decide if justice was served or if a grievous injustice has prevailed. And if pressed on the subject of what happened that last night in the orchard, I will speak as truthfully as I can: If something bad happened, I didnt see it.  ",5,9
"MULDER: (on phone) Hey, Scully, its me.  ",5,10
"MULDER: (on phone) Right, right. I know. But I - I just received some information about - about a case. A classic X-files --- classic. I wanted to share it with you.  ",5,10
"MULDER: (on phone) You didnt rent a convertible, did you?  ",5,10
MULDER: (on phone) Are you aware of the statistics of decapitation?  ,5,10
MULDER: (on phone) You shouldnt talk and drive at the same time. Are you aware of the statistics .? Hello?  ,5,10
MULDER: (on phone) Mulder.  ,5,10
MULDER: (on phone) I thought you said you were on vacation.  ,5,10
MULDER: (on phone) I thought you said you didnt want to be disturbed. You wanted to get out of your head for a few days.  ,5,10
MULDER: (on phone) Its the Worlds Deadliest Swarms. (Fumbles with remote to stop the tape.) Um .. you said you were going to be unreachable. Whats going on?  ,5,10
"MULDER: (on phone, voice) A handle on what?  ",5,10
MULDER: (on phone) Towards who?  ,5,10
MULDER: (on phone) Themselves?  ,5,10
"MULDER: (on phone, voice) Dead? How?  ",5,10
MULDER: (on phone) Huh  it sounds to me like thats witchcraft or maybe some sorcery that youre looking for there.  ,5,10
MULDER: (on phone) Maybe you dont know what youre looking for.  ,5,10
MULDER: (on phone) Scully   ,5,10
MULDER: (on phone) Marry me.  ,5,10
"MULDER: (on phone) Well, you know, short of looking for a lady wearing a pointy hat riding a broomstick, I think you pretty much got it covered there.  ",5,10
"MULDER: (on phone, voice) Hey, morning, sunshine.  ",5,10
"MULDER: (on phone, voice) Yeah. I was a little worried about you. I was wondering if you needed my help up there.  ",5,10
"MULDER: (on phone, voice) I left you a message at the motel. You didnt get it?  ",5,10
"MULDER: (on phone, voice) Yeah?  ",5,10
"MULDER: (on phone) Im at home. Theyre doing construction right out the window. Hold on a second. (to imaginary construction workers) Hey fellas! Can you just keep it down for a second, maybe? (He bounces his basketball twice more and tosses it away from him. It crashes into some piece of furniture. MULDER pauses then picks up phone again.) Thank you. (to SCULLY) Yeah, hey. I was - I was thinking about this case. You know, maybe its not witchcraft after all. Maybe theres a scientific explanation.  ",5,10
"MULDER: (on phone) Yeah, St. Vituss dance.  ",5,10
MULDER: (on phone) It affect groups of people causing unexplained outbursts of uncontrollable jerks and spasms.  ,5,10
"MULDER: (on phone) Oh. (Spits juice back into bottle.) Youre obviously not a fan of American Bandstand, Scully.  ",5,10
MULDER: (on phone) Yeah?  ,5,10
MULDER: (on phone) Hello?  ,5,10
MULDER: (on phone) Hey. I thought you werent answering your cell phone.  ,5,10
"MULDER: (on phone) I, uh, I had a new thought about this case youre on. Theres a viral infection thats spread by simple touch   ",5,10
MULDER: (on phone) What types of objects?  ,5,10
MULDER: (on phone) You mean like Chuckie?  ,5,10
"MULDER: (on phone) Yeah, the talking doll myth is well established in literature, especially in New England. The-the fetish or Juju is believed to pass on magical powers onto its possessor. Some of the early witches were condemned for little more that proclaiming that these objects existed. The supposed witch having premonitory visions and things . Why do you ask?  ",5,10
"MULDER: (on phone) You didnt find a talking doll, did you, Scully?  ",5,10
MULDER: (on phone) I would suggest that you check the back of the doll for a - a plastic ring with a string on it.  ,5,10
MULDER: (on phone) That would be my first . Hello?  ,5,10
"MULDER: Oh, hey, Scully. How you doing? (Laces his fingers together smoothly to hide the row of pencils.) How are you feeling? Rested?  ",5,10
MULDER: What?  ,5,10
"MULDER: Oh, I got it down on ""M"" Street at some head shop about five years ago.  ",5,10
MULDER: Why?  ,5,10
MULDER: You do?  ,5,10
MULDER: Who?  ,5,10
MULDER: Who?  ,5,10
"MULDER: Yeah. Hey, does this have something to do with that case you were working on?  ",5,10
MULDER: Did you solve it?  ,5,10
"MULDER: Oh, God. Its amazing what I can accomplish without incessant meddling or questioning into everything I do. Its just   ",5,10
"MULDER: (embarrassed, but charming) Theres  got to be an explanation.  ",5,10
"MULDER: Charles Figgis, ten year veteran of the US Marshalls Service. Multiple gunshot wounds, high speed Teflon rounds. His partner, Gerald Boyce was DOA at Mercy General. Tried to catch a nine millimeter slug in his teeth.  ",5,11
MULDER: Figgis and Boyce had radioed in that they were coming here to apprehend Pico Salazar.  ,5,11
MULDER: The Colombian Cartels banking liaison. Salazar escaped from federal custody three months ago. Boyce and Figgis were on the offender transport squad that lost him. (MULDER is looking at other bodies.) They took his escape personally. A phone tip told them that Salazar was going to be here tonight.  ,5,11
MULDER: I dont think he is ... or was. But there were a lot of very photogenic gentlemen that were.  ,5,11
"MULDER: Yeah, not the type youd expect to associate with a cartel boss.  ",5,11
MULDER: Maybe it was for the pie.  ,5,11
MULDER: (Pulls back sheet over dead MAN with LAPTOP) Donald Gelman.  ,5,11
MULDER: Donald Gelman --- Silicon Valley software pioneer. Hes been missing since 1979.  ,5,11
"MULDER: He invented the internet. (SCULLY looks skeptical.) Well, he didnt quite invent it, but hes a Silicon Valley folk hero. He was writing internet software even before there was an internet.  ",5,11
MULDER: On the eve of the deal that was going to set him up as another Bill Gates he went hiking in the Sierras and said hed think about it. Never came back.  ,5,11
MULDER: (picks up GELMANS laptop which is still on) Maybe thats the point.  ,5,11
MULDER: I think somebody obviously wanted him dead.  ,5,11
"MULDER: Eight unconnected dealers all at the same place at the same time, all tipped off by phone looking for somebody, last call goes to the Marshalls, they arrive, place explodes, Gelman dies in the crossfire. Its genius.  ",5,11
"MULDER: Well, when youre talking about Donald Gelman you want to kill the brain, not the body.  ",5,11
"MULDER: Gee, I hope so.  ",5,11
MULDER: All except Gelman.  ,5,11
MULDER: And found himself under investigation by the NSA.  ,5,11
MULDER: That may be what got him killed.  ,5,11
MULDER: (holding CD) I found this in his CD ROM drive.  ,5,11
MULDER: What for?  ,5,11
MULDER: Standard ID. Shipping container.  ,5,11
MULDER: Frohike says this place is really proud of its accurate tracking.  ,5,11
MULDER: Yeah. Should be straight ahead. Three rows and to the right.  ,5,11
MULDER: Sounds like somebodys home.  ,5,11
MULDER: FBI. Come ....  ,5,11
MULDER: (in pain) Im all right! Go get her!  ,5,11
MULDER: Home sweet home.  ,5,11
"MULDER: Are you ""Invisigoth?""  ",5,11
MULDER: Donald Gelmans mailbox. You left a return address.  ,5,11
MULDER: Hey!  ,5,11
MULDER: We had just cause to come in.  ,5,11
MULDER: What is that?  ,5,11
MULDER: (watching monitor zero in on a geographical location) Scully ....  ,5,11
"MULDER: Scully, weve got to get out of here right now. (Runs out, pulling ESTHER behind him.)  ",5,11
MULDER: (at car) Its locked. Give me the keys.  ,5,11
MULDER: Give me the keys!  ,5,11
"MULDER: Get in the car, Scully!  ",5,11
"MULDER: When you said ""it"" was targeting us back there, you meant an artificial intelligence. Donald Gelman was trying to create a sentient AI. A program with its own consciousness. He succeeded, didnt he?  ",5,11
"MULDER: Wait, what do you mean, ""got loose?""  ",5,11
MULDER: (Starts to say something)  ,5,11
"MULDER: You saw what happened back there, Scully. You saw that container blow.  ",5,11
MULDER: What about Star Wars? Brilliant Pebbles?  ,5,11
MULDER: Then how did it know to target the container?  ,5,11
MULDER: Whos David?  ,5,11
MULDER: Where?  ,5,11
MULDER: And you cant find it?  ,5,11
MULDER: Donald Gelman is dead. He was killed in a café. What looks like a hit.  ,5,11
MULDER: We have Donalds computer.  ,5,11
"MULDER: Well, we have this. (Show CD) ""Twilight Time.""  ",5,11
MULDER: Dont let their looks fool you.  ,5,11
MULDER: (Crossing to remove the cuffs.) You dont want to take a vote.  ,5,11
MULDER: (referring to computer screen where ESTHER has pulled up a diagram) What is this?  ,5,11
"MULDER: Oh, all right. But if you load the Kill Switch, whats to stop it from playing another funny joke on us?  ",5,11
MULDER: Physically?  ,5,11
MULDER: Did he find it?  ,5,11
MULDER: (on phone) Scully?  ,5,11
"MULDER: (on phone) Yeah, Ive found something down in Fairfax County. A derelict chicken farm with a T3 connection, paid for by Aleph Industries, Palo Alto, of which theres no other record anywhere.  ",5,11
MULDER: (on phone) Where are you? Sounds like youre driving.  ,5,11
MULDER: (on phone) You have Esther with you?  ,5,11
MULDER: (on phone) Where are you going?  ,5,11
MULDER: (on phone) Where?  ,5,11
MULDER (into phone) Scully? Scully?  ,5,11
"MULDER: (from computer infrared, sound distorted perspective) FBI! Im a federal agent.!  ",5,11
MULDER: (lifting visor) David Markham.  ,5,11
MULDER: (groggy) Whats going on?  ,5,11
"MULDER: Whats that smell? (sees his badly burned arms) Oh, jeez ...  ",5,11
MULDER: Is it bad?  ,5,11
MULDER: My arms hurt.  ,5,11
"MULDER: No, wait .... (almost passing out) Call my doctor. You have to call ... my doctor. Call Dr. Scully. Please call Dr. Scully.  ",5,11
"MULDER: Call her. (groans as a nurse pushes his head back down on pillow.) No, no. No ... what are you doing?  ",5,11
MULDER: No. No.  ,5,11
MULDER: No-no-no-no! Ahhhhh!  ,5,11
MULDER: I feel sick.  ,5,11
"MULDER: I remember ... wires, and uh ...  ",5,11
MULDER: What do you mean?  ,5,11
"MULDER: Oh, my God. What did you do with my arm? What did they do with my arm?  ",5,11
MULDER: (almost panicking) Theyll come back for what?  ,5,11
MULDER: (high pitched) What do they want?!  ,5,11
"MULDER: This is crazy! You have to help me. You have to get me out of here ... please! (She pulls his head to her breasts.) Help me. Help me. Please, help me.  ",5,11
"MULDER: Oh, I had this terrible dream. (NURSE NANCY gives a knowing smile. MULDER smiles back) And then I had a good dream.  ",5,11
MULDER: Tell them what?  ,5,11
MULDER: Nobody asked me anything.  ,5,11
MULDER: No.  ,5,11
MULDER: I ...  ,5,11
MULDER: Scully!  ,5,11
MULDER: I didnt tell them anything!  ,5,11
"MULDER: (showing her his arms, pitifully) Look ...  ",5,11
MULDER: (realizing it cant really be her) Of course we do.  ,5,11
"MULDER: Scully? Scully? Scully, help! Help! (camera outside trailer) Help!! Sculleeee!!!  ",5,11
MULDER: (inside) Scully ...  ,5,11
MULDER: Im in here. Scully ...  ,5,11
MULDER: I wonder.  ,5,11
"MULDER: What if she managed to establish an uplink, Scully? A satellite transmission?  ",5,11
"MULDER: (voice) Artificial life. It could exist. It could be here among us, evolving.  ",5,11
"MULDER: (voice) Yeah, but what are we but impulses? Electrical and chemical through a bag of meat and bones. Youre the scientist. You tell me.  ",5,11
MULDER: Look at that. Huh... Huh?  ,5,12
"MULDER: Oh, shi...  ",5,12
"MULDER: Don't. (He cuts her off and points his finger at her) Don't even start with me. (He crinkles up a piece of paper and throws it across the room to the trash can. He misses, walks over and kicks the hell out of the can. Scully watches him. He stops jamming a foot down on the can and walks over to the deak.) I know what I saw.  ",5,12
MULDER: What do you mean what am I going to tell him? I'm going to tell him exactly what I saw. What are you going to tell him?  ,5,12
"MULDER: Now, how is that different? (She gives him a look that's mildly exasperated) Look, Scully, I'm the one who may wind up going to prison here. I got to know if you're going to back me up or what.  ",5,12
MULDER: I did not overreact. Ronnie Strickland was a vampire.  ,5,12
"MULDER: You're my proof. You were there. (She heavily exhales) OK, now you're scaring me. I wanna know exactly what you're gonna tell Skinner.  ",5,12
"MULDER: No, no, no, I didn't say that. I just want to hear it the way you saw it.  ",5,12
"MULDER: Prison, Scully. Your cell mate's nickname is going to be Large Marge. She's going to read a lot of Gertrude Stein.  ",5,12
"MULDER: All right, start at the beginning.  ",5,12
MULDER: Hope you brought your cowboy boots. (She picks it up and looks at it)  ,5,12
"MULDER: Yee-haw! Actually, a town called Chaney, about 50 miles south of there, population 361 ... by all accounts, very rustic and charming, but as of late, ground zero the locus for a series of mysterious nocturnal exsanguinations.  ",5,12
MULDER: How does that grab ya?  ,5,12
"MULDER: Dead cow! Exactly. Specifically, a dead 900-pound Holstein. Its body drained of blood as was this one, (He clicks through a series of slides of dead cows. Scully is wondering why this is important) ... this one, this one, this one, and so on. Six, all in all --approximately one a week over the past six weeks.  ",5,12
MULDER: Two small puncture wounds on the neck?  ,5,12
MULDER: Too bad. We got 'em. Check it out. (He clicks to the next slide. It's a close up picture of two puncture marks on the side of a cow's neck)  ,5,12
"MULDER: Yeah, that's probably it, satanic cultists. Come on, Scully.  ",5,12
"MULDER: El Chupacabra? No, they got four fangs, not two, and they suck goats, hence the name.  ",5,12
MULDER: Classic vampirism.  ,5,12
"MULDER: And one dead human last night - a vacationer from New Jersey. (She looks at him as he leaves) Come on, we got to go.  ",5,12
MULDER: Lock the door on your way out.  ,5,12
"MULDER: Yes. I'm ... Agents Mulder and ... (He snaps his fingers as if to remember) uh ... Scully. What do you say, we go take a look at your victim.  ",5,12
"MULDER: Come on, Scully, get those little legs moving. Come on. (Her pleasant smile turns to annoyance at Mulder and she walks to the door)  ",5,12
MULDER: Nice threads. (The corpse is wearing a Hawaiian shirt. Scully snaps on latex gloves and comes up behind Mulder to look at the victim)  ,5,12
MULDER: Your satanic cultists have some sharp little teeth.  ,5,12
"MULDER: Go ahead, tell him your, uh, (he makes his little fingers go into quotation marks with a goofy look on his face) ""theory.""  ",5,12
MULDER: What about the fang marks?  ,5,12
MULDER: Dana?! (he laughs) He never even knew your first name.  ,5,12
MULDER: No. Go ahead ..... Dana.  ,5,12
"MULDER: Sheriff, you say this man is exactly as you found him?  ",5,12
"MULDER: Have you noticed that this man's shoes are untied? (In a voice like ""Eureka! I've found the answer!)  ",5,12
"MULDER: This means something. Sheriff, do you have an old cemetery in town off the beaten path, the creepier the better?  ",5,12
MULDER: Take me there now. (he snaps his fingers at the sheriff)  ,5,12
"MULDER: Scully, we're going to need a complete autopsy on this man, the sooner the better.  ",5,12
MULDER: I don't know.  ,5,12
"MULDER: Come on, Sheriff Hartwell.  ",5,12
MULDER: The name of it was actually the Sam Houston Motor Lodge. (The name onscreen changes to Sam Houston Motor Lodge.)  ,5,12
MULDER: What? (He enters)  ,5,12
MULDER: Nothing. Chloral hydrate?  ,5,12
MULDER: Nothing. Who slipped him the mickey?  ,5,12
MULDER: What kind of vampire would do that?  ,5,12
MULDER: We got another dead tourist. You got to do another autopsy.  ,5,12
MULDER: I won't let it go to waste.  ,5,12
"MULDER: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.  ",5,12
MULDER: That's it?  ,5,12
MULDER: Who's the black private dick who's a sex machine with all the chicks? (falsetto) Shaft! Can you dig it? They say this cat Shaft is a bad mother ... (falsetto) Shut your mouth! Talkin' 'bout Shaft.  ,5,12
MULDER: I did not!  ,5,12
MULDER: That's what you're going to tell Skinner?  ,5,12
MULDER: You are afraid to tell the truth. (points his finger at her)  ,5,12
"MULDER: That's not the way it happened at all. I mean, what are you afraid of? That if you tell it the way it really happened, that you'll look like an idiot, like me?  ",5,12
MULDER: You're damn right. Yesterday morning began like any other morning. You arrived at the office characteristically less than exuberant.  ,5,12
MULDER: I hope you brought your cowboy boots.  ,5,12
"MULDER: Actually, it's a little town just south of there called Chaney, Texas. They've had some incidents down there recently, which I think you'll agree, are pretty unusual.  ",5,12
"MULDER: Well, I-I brought some slides with which to better illustrate. Here we go. (He turns to the first slide.)  ",5,12
MULDER: It's actually six dead cows. And here's the really interesting thing ...  ,5,12
"MULDER: Um, well, because of the manner in which they died. All six were mysteriously exsanguinated.  ",5,12
"MULDER: And two little puncture marks right here on the neck. Look, I got a slide of that. (He goes through each slide of the six dead cows, slowly, embarassed that she has to put up with all this. Scully looks at him to maybe speed it up and little. He finally gets to the puncture marks. She nods sharply, Yep, there it is) And, um, one dead human victim. Last night -- a vacationer from New Jersey. His body completely drained of blood and two little puncture wounds on his neck. Okay, look, Scully I-I don't want to jump to any hasty conclusions, but on the strength of the evidence that we have here, I think that what we *may* be looking at is what *appears* to be a series of vampire or *vampire-like* acts.  ",5,12
"MULDER: Uh ... well, on the corpses drained of blood and the fang marks on the neck. (She rolls her eyes and he gives a soft chuckle) But, as always, I'm very eager to hear your opinion.  ",5,12
"MULDER: Well, why not?  ",5,12
"MULDER: Well ... that's ... one opinion, and I respect that. Nonetheless, I'm thinking a murder has been committed here and we can go down there and help bring a killer to justice in whatever form -- mortal or ... immortal he may take.  ",5,12
MULDER VOICE OVER: Upon arriving at the funeral home I made an interesting observation. One which you apparently didn't hear.  ,5,12
MULDER TALKING TO MORTICIAN: That's a whole lot of caskets.  ,5,12
MULDER: Why would a town with a population of only 361 need that?  ,5,12
MULDER VOICE OVER: Apparently your mind was somewhere else. (Sheriff Hartwell walks in. Scully is dazzled)  ,5,12
MULDER: He had a slight over bite.  ,5,12
"MULDER: I'm just trying to be thorough. So, anyway, then we went to take a look at the body.  ",5,12
MULDER: (professionally) No exam has been done?  ,5,12
"MULDER: That depends on what you think it looks like, Sheriff Hartwell. Vampires have always been with us, in ancient myths and stories passed down from early man. (Scully stands behind Mulder, smiling, eyes wide, rocks from side to side, goofing around) From the Babylonian Ekimu to the Chinese Kuang-Shi to Motetz Dam of the Hebrews, the Mormo of ancient Greece and Rome to the more familiar Nosferatu of Transylvania.  ",5,12
"MULDER: Still, that leaves us in something of a quandary because there are as many different kinds of vampires as there are cultures that fear them. (Scully yawns and covers her mouth) Some don't even subsist on blood. The Bulgarian Ubour, for example, eats only manure.  ",5,12
"MULDER: To the Serbs, a prime indicator of vampirism is red hair. (raises his hand to Scully's head) Some vampires are thought to be eternal. Others are thought to have a life span of only 40 days. (Scully's pointing at her watch, rolling her eyes, carrying on.) Sunlight kills certain vampires while others come and go as they please, day or night.  ",5,12
"MULDER: My point is that we don't know exactly what we're looking for. What kind of vampire, or if you prefer, what kind of vampire this killer wishes himself to be.  ",5,12
MULDER: I'm getting to it.  ,5,12
"MULDER VOICE OVER: So, while you stayed behind to do the autopsy, the Sheriff drove me to the town cemetery.  ",5,12
"MULDER: Historically, cemeteries were thought to be a haven for vampires as are castles, catacombs and swamps, but unfortunately, you don't have any of those.  ",5,12
"MULDER: Yeah. So, we're out here looking for any signs of vampiric activity.  ",5,12
MULDER: Broken or shifted tombstones. The absence of birds singing.  ,5,12
MULDER: A faint groaning coming from under the earth. The sound of manducation -- of the creature eating its own death shroud.  ,5,12
MULDER: Manducation.  ,5,12
"MULDER: Now, Sheriff, I know my methods may seem a little odd to you, but..  ",5,12
"MULDER: It's just that my gut instinct tells me that the killer will visit this place. That it may well hold some fascination -- some kind of siren call for him, you know. (A horn honks)  ",5,12
"MULDER: Maybe after nightfall, Sheriff, but he'll come. Oh, he'll come.  ",5,12
"MULDER VOICE OVER: So, we staked out the cemetery.  ",5,12
MULDER: Hmm?  ,5,12
MULDER: I'm getting to it.  ,5,12
MULDER: Sunflower seed? (He accidently drops some) Sorry.  ,5,12
"MULDER: Historically, certain types of seeds were thought to fascinate vampires. Chiefly oats and millet, but you make do with what you have. Remember when I said before that we didn't know what type of vampire we were looking for?  ",5,12
"MULDER: Well, oddly enough, there seems to be one obscure fact which in all the stories told by the different cultures is exactly the same, and that's that vampires are really, really obsessive-compulsive. Yeah, you toss a handful of seeds at one, no matter what he's doing he's got to stop and pick it up. If he sees a knotted rope, he's got to untie it. It's in his nature. In fact, that's why I'm guessing that our victim's shoelaces were untied.  ",5,12
"MULDER: Well, he didn't actually pick them up. He counted them.  ",5,12
"MULDER: Well, if he had picked them up he would have been a vampire.  ",5,12
"MULDER: Well, that would be illegal, right?  ",5,12
MULDER: Yeah.  ,5,12
"MULDER VOICE OVER: Anyway, skipping ahead...  ",5,12
"MULDER VOICE OVER: Here's something you may not know: Shooting out the tires on a runaway RV is a lot harder than it looks. (Didn't slow it down at all) I then tried a different approach. Help! (Mulder's hanging on for dear life to the back ladder, body flat to the ground. That's how he got muddy!)  ",5,12
"MULDER: Help! (He lets go, the momentum rolls him away, landing in a mud puddle. The people walk to him)  ",5,12
"MULDER VOICE OVER: Finally, we prevailed.  ",5,12
MULDER: Right down to the shoes. (They are untied)  ,5,12
MULDER VOICE OVER: We interviewed everyone present. No one had seen anything.  ,5,12
"MULDER'S VOICE OVER: Tired, frustrated and lacking a solid lead, I just wanted to get cleaned up. I had the sheriff drop me at the motel, which is where I ran into you.  ",5,12
MULDER VOICE OVER: Finally... you left.  ,5,12
MULDER: She ordered a pizza from you? Excellent. How much?  ,5,12
MULDER: Let me get my wallet. (He goes into the bathroom and comes out with it) How much?  ,5,12
"MULDER: Okay, there's $13.  ",5,12
"MULDER: Ah, Scully.  ",5,12
"MULDER VOICE OVER: So, I ate your dinner. (The vibrating stops and he reaches behind him to deposit more money) And that's when I saw it. (He sees his shoes) But by then it was too late. (He realizes he's been drugged and reaches for the phone. He falls off the bed. He dials the phone)  ",5,12
"MULDER VOICE OVER: Then I was out cold. I don't know for how long, but when I finally came to ... (Ronnie is bent over him, eyes glowing, teeth flaring, ready to bite)  ",5,12
MULDER: Square in the chest. No effect.  ,5,12
"MULDER: Well, I don't think I'll use the phrase ""flying squirrel"" when I talk to Skinner, but ... yeah, that's what happened.  ",5,12
"MULDER VOICE OVER: You checked on me, then left to pursue Ronnie Strickland into the woods. Once I recovered I knew what I had to do. (He picks up a leg shaped like a stake as it broke off, splintered)  ",5,12
"MULDER VOICE OVER: I caught sight of him, chased him over hill and dale, and in the end... (He puts the stake through Ronnie's heart)  ",5,12
"MULDER: Well, they'll have to, once they examine Ronnie Strickland's body.  ",5,12
MULDER: Would you stop that?  ,5,12
MULDER: Stop it. (Skinner opens his door and sticks his head out)  ,5,12
MULDER: I was drugged!  ,5,12
MULDER: The coroner's dead?  ,5,12
MULDER: I noticed that.  ,5,12
"MULDER: I noticed that, too.  ",5,12
MULDER: Because tradition states that a vampire needs to sleep in his native soil.  ,5,12
MULDER: Yeah.  ,5,12
MULDER: Fangs are very rarely mentioned in the folklore. Real vampires aren't actually thought to have them. It's more an invention of Bram Stoker's. I think maybe you were right before when you said that this is just a guy who's watched too many Dracula movies. He just happens to be a real vampire. (She looks around)  ,5,12
MULDER: What about his family -- the ones who are going to sue us for 446 million?  ,5,12
MULDER: No home address? (A car pulls up) That's the sheriff.  ,5,12
"MULDER: Yeah, actually you can. You can stay behind here with Agent Scully and keep an eye on things while I check something out. (He puts his hand on her shoulder, says quietly in exaggerated Southern accent) Don't say I never did nothing for ya.  ",5,12
MULDER: Where might you be living if your mail came general delivery around here?  ,5,12
MULDER: You're good.  ,5,12
"MULDER: Hello? (He opens it. Ronnie's inside, headphones on and listening to something rocky) Sleeping late. (Ronnie bolts up. Mulder slams the cover shut and gets on top. The cover rocks up and down as Ronnie tries to get out.) Ronnie Strickland ... you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Come on, cut it out, Ronnie. (He looks out the window and sees the town folk walking to the motor home. Eyes glowing.) Oh damn... (He hooks his handcuffs on the handles to lock Ronnie in. He shines his flashlight around the trailer and spots some garlic bread sticks, grabs two and goes out. He shapes the bread sticks into a cross and thrusts it at the people) Back! (Doesn't work) Ahh! No!! Aaaaahh! (They all crowd around him, he's lost in a sea of vampires)  ",5,12
"MULDER: Scully, what happened?  ",5,12
MULDER: They pulled up stakes. (Mulder's all muddy and his shoes are untied. She stoops to tie them)  ,5,12
"MULDER: And I can neither confirm nor deny agent Scully's version of events, but, um...  ",5,12
"MULDER: That is ... essentially, exactly the way it happened.  ",5,12
MULDER VOICE OVER: Except for the part about the buck teeth.  ,5,12
"MULDER (V.O.): Before the exploration of space, of the moon and the planets, man hailed that the heavens were the home and province of powerful gods who controlled not just the vast firmament, but the earthly fate of man himself and that the pantheon of powerful, warring deities, was the cause and reason for the human condition, for the past and the future, and for which great monuments would be created on earth as in heaven. But in time man replaced these gods with new gods and new religions that provided no more certain or greater answers than those worshipped by his Greek or Roman or Egyptian ancestors. And while we've chosen now our monolithic and benevolent gods and found our certainties in science, believers all, we wait for a sign, a revelation. Our eyes turn skyward ready to accept the truly incredible to find our destiny written in the stars. But how do we best look to see? With new eyes or old?  ",5,13
"MULDER: All this conjecture - the ""ontological shock"" that you speak of, for which we are so ill-equipped - is not only false but dangerous. This woman ... this woman presents no good or credible testimony apart from the feel-good message that she promotes.  ",5,13
"MULDER: No, I don't think she's lying. I think that if you prepare people well enough to believe a lie, they will believe it as if it were true. And if you tell them a really big lie, like there are aliens from outer space, much more than a small one, they will believe in it. And if you suggest to them these aliens are doing bad things to them, the ... the power of the suggestion will be to make people believe that certain psychopathologies and neuroses that they're suffering from can now be attributed to that.  ",5,13
MULDER: No. I just question mindless belief.  ,5,13
"MULDER: What I've seen, I've seen because I wanted to believe. I ... if you look too hard, you can go mad, but if you continue to look, you become liberated. And you become awake, as if from a dream, realizing that ... that the lies are there simply to protect what they're advertising: a government which knows its greatest strength is not in defense, but in attack. It's strongly held by believers in UFO phenomena that there is military complicity or involvement in abductions, but what if there is no complicity? What if there is simply just the military, seeking to develop an arsenal against which there is no defense: biological warfare, which justifies - in their eyes - making an ass out of the nation with stories of little green men - a conspiracy wrapped in a plot inside a government agenda.  ",5,13
MULDER: Dr. Werber?  ,5,13
MULDER: Almost five years.  ,5,13
MULDER: A lot has changed.  ,5,13
"MULDER: Well, I've come to distrust a lot of things. I've - I've come to distrust those memories.  ",5,13
MULDER: For what?  ,5,13
"MULDER: I'm not questioning your methods, Dr. Werber. I'm questioning myself, and how I was tricked, how I was led to believe through an elaborate staging of events that my sister had been abducted.  ",5,13
MULDER: I don't think you understand. There's just too much evidence that it's all been a lie. The conspiracy is not to hide the existence of extraterrestrials. It's to make people believe in it so completely that they question nothing.  ,5,13
"MULDER: Yeah. Is Patient ""X"" any more credible?  ",5,13
MULDER: Hi.  ,5,13
MULDER: I am?  ,5,13
MULDER: You may not like me as much as you like that story.  ,5,13
MULDER: How's that?  ,5,13
MULDER: Cassandra ...  ,5,13
MULDER: Cassandra?  ,5,13
MULDER: Are you here voluntarily?  ,5,13
"MULDER: Whatever it is that you're afraid of, I suggest that you check yourself out of here as soon as you can and start living your life. Okay?  ",5,13
MULDER: The man you're talking about died because of what he believed in. He died in a room after I'd been interrogating him - after he received a visit from some men from our government.  ,5,13
MULDER: Cassandra ... there was a time when I would've believed what you're saying without a doubt.  ,5,13
MULDER: I'm not.  ,5,13
"MULDER: Do I look like I'm having fun, Scully?  ",5,13
MULDER: That makes sense. I've had my head up my rear end for the last five years.  ,5,13
MULDER: Cassandra Spender is living proof that the truth I've so boldly sought for the last five years is the truth of a madman.  ,5,13
"MULDER: One more anal-probing, gyro-pyro levitating-ecoplasm alien anti-matter story, and I'm gonna take out my gun and shoot somebody.  ",5,13
MULDER: How do you know about Cassandra Spender?  ,5,13
MULDER: Great.  ,5,13
"MULDER: You know, you try to reveal what's hidden, you try to incite people with the facts, but they'd rather believe some insane nonsense, refusing to believe what our government is capable of.  ",5,13
"MULDER: Yeah, and still nobody believes me.  ",5,13
MULDER: What?  ,5,13
"MULDER: The woman is a nut, Scully.  ",5,13
"MULDER: Where the government no doubt removed her brain. Isn't that what her son stopped you to say, Scully?  ",5,13
MULDER: Wish granted.  ,5,13
MULDER: Are there any survivors?  ,5,13
MULDER: From the smell ...  ,5,13
MULDER: Any preliminary theories?  ,5,13
MULDER: Self-immolation?  ,5,13
MULDER: And what was their relationship to each other? Were they families?  ,5,13
MULDER: And you think it's related to your abduction from the same place?  ,5,13
MULDER: You think this is some kind of abduction scenario?  ,5,13
MULDER: Do you have any evidence of that?  ,5,13
MULDER: That's what I'm asking you.  ,5,13
MULDER: No. I'm going to give you an explanation.  ,5,13
MULDER: You knew them?  ,5,13
MULDER: What would you like me to do?  ,5,13
MULDER: Stop who?  ,5,13
"MULDER: Oh, son of ... the prophet.  ",5,13
MULDER: There you have it.  ,5,13
MULDER: I'm sorry. We won't be bothering you or your mother anymore.  ,5,13
"MULDER: Are you ready for this? I've been going over the initial forensics and pathology reports from the incident at Skyland Mountain and, while the event itself remains unexplained, I think it's less than a mystery who's involved - at least for me, and certainly for you. Our pathologists here haven't finalized their reports, but I was able to have three victims selected at random for x-rays.  ",5,13
MULDER: That's how I found these - small pieces of what looks like metal in the charred cervical tissue here ... here ... and here. Implants.  ,5,13
"MULDER: I followed up with the families of the three victims and I found that none had any cult associations but two out of the three belong to the local mutual UFO networks, and both of them claimed abduction experiences, and both of them were being treated by a medical health practitioner over the past few months.  ",5,13
MULDER: Take a look.  ,5,13
MULDER: The implants triggered those responses. Those people were led to Skyland Mountain.  ,5,13
"MULDER: By the same government that put the implant in you, to function as a homing mechanism.  ",5,13
MULDER: Why not? A tracking system using military app satellite technology to monitor test subjects. Or to stage what people might otherwise believe are alien abductions.  ,5,13
MULDER: I don't know that yet.  ,5,13
MULDER: Mulder.  ,5,13
MULDER: Yes?  ,5,13
MULDER: Yes.  ,5,13
MULDER: No.  ,5,13
MULDER: Where are you?  ,5,13
MULDER: Marita? Mar ...  ,5,13
MULDER: Who's this?  ,5,13
MULDER: This is Fox Mulder.  ,5,13
"MULDER: I'm actually looking for Agent Scully. I haven't been able to reach her, and she said that -  ",5,13
MULDER: What are you talking about?  ,5,13
MULDER: Gone where?  ,5,13
MULDER: Was she here? Is she here?!  ,5,14
MULDER: She's alive?  ,5,14
MULDER: Scully?  ,5,14
MULDER: The answer just got loaded onto that chopper!  ,5,14
MULDER: Who?  ,5,14
MULDER: What time is it? It's time to thank your lucky stars.  ,5,14
"MULDER: I'm not laughing at you. I'm just very happy to be standing here talking to you, that's all.  ",5,14
MULDER: You were airlifted here in vasogenic shock.  ,5,14
MULDER: You've got some first-degree burns and scorching on your hands and face.  ,5,14
MULDER: You don't remember?  ,5,14
MULDER: Is any of this coming back to you?  ,5,14
MULDER: I was hoping you were going to answer that question for me.  ,5,14
MULDER: I'll come back.  ,5,14
MULDER: I'm sorry.  ,5,14
MULDER: What was I doing with her? What makes you think we have anything to do with this?  ,5,14
MULDER: Look -  ,5,14
MULDER: Your mother will be found.  ,5,14
"MULDER: Well, at least you're not alone. None of the other survivors have been able to give a cogent account, either.  ",5,14
MULDER: Do you remember when you last saw Cassandra Spender?  ,5,14
"MULDER: I ran more x-rays. I haven't told anybody yet what I found, though.  ",5,14
"MULDER: That would explain how you were directed to the site, and why you can't remember. It would explain the sensation Cassandra Spender was describing, her abduction fantasies. It would explain Skyland Mountain.  ",5,14
"MULDER: It all comes down to a question, Scully. One that hasn't been answered or I don't even think honestly addressed. Who made that chip in your neck? That chip was found in a military research facility. Our government made that chip, implanted it in your neck as part of a secret military project to develop a biochemical weapon, to monitor your immunity, or to destroy you like a lab rat, if the truth were to be exposed. Your cancer ... your cure ... everything that's happening to you now - it all points to that chip. The truth I've been searching for? That truth is in you.  ",5,14
MULDER: I don't trust those memories now.  ,5,14
"MULDER: If I could give you those memories, if I could prove that I was right and that what I believed for so long was wrong ...  ",5,14
MULDER: I'm familiar with the regression process and Dr. Werber's work. I've heard hundreds of those types of abduction scenarios.  ,5,14
"MULDER: The imagery is startling, but not atypical: bright lights, weightlessness, stolen memory, lost time expressed as a close encounter, an abduction, religious rapture as a kind of dark night of the soul.  ",5,14
"MULDER: Described and then interpreted into a linear narrative, a, uh, gestalt impression of a subjective, nonlinear experience.  ",5,14
MULDER: That Agent Scully witnessed a very powerful event. Not unlike the one I described on my regression tape of the false memory of my sister's abduction.  ,5,14
MULDER: It was staged.  ,5,14
"MULDER: To test a classified military project, or to cover it up.  ",5,14
"MULDER: Cassandra Spender was taken aboard a military aircraft, as part of the staging.  ",5,14
MULDER: Then I suggest you put that in your report.  ,5,14
MULDER: Isn't that how you like to beat yourself? If those are my last words I can do better.  ,5,14
"MULDER: Hey, thanks.  ",5,14
MULDER: What's stopping you?  ,5,14
MULDER: I thought you were serious.  ,5,14
MULDER: Serve who?  ,5,14
"MULDER: Krycek, you're a murderer, a liar and a coward. Just because you stick a gun in my chest, I'm supposed to believe you're my friend?  ",5,14
MULDER: Come in.  ,5,14
MULDER: Thinking.  ,5,14
"MULDER: Oh, the usual. Destiny, fate, how to throw a curve ball. The inextricable relationships in our lives that are neither accidental nor somehow in our control, either.  ",5,14
MULDER: I've been doing some reconsidering of my own.  ,5,14
MULDER: Maybe an answer ... to a question you and I seem to have been destined to ask.  ,5,14
MULDER: We're federal agents requesting permission to enter the base.  ,5,14
MULDER: It's Mulder. I wasn't aware that any special authorization was needed to enter.  ,5,14
MULDER: Are you aware there's been a leak and contamination in one of the labs and the personnel on site need immediate medical attention?  ,5,14
"MULDER: Why don't you go check on that, son? I'd hate for somebody to die because you were uninformed.  ",5,14
"MULDER: Buckle up, Scully.  ",5,14
MULDER: Who?  ,5,14
MULDER: Nooooooooo!  ,5,14
MULDER: I don't know.  ,5,14
MULDER: Arthur Dales?  ,5,15
"MULDER: (very nervous, very green, very cute) I'm a-a profiler with the behavioral sciences unit. (shows badge, clumsily) You are Arthur Dales, former special agent with the Bureau? I need to ask you some questions about a man named Edward Skur. You opened a-a file on him in 1952.  ",5,15
MULDER: I-I brought the case file here with me. (shows an OLD X-File 525652)  ,5,15
"MULDER: It's, uh... it's an unsolved case.  ",5,15
"MULDER: Mr. Dales, most of your report has been censored... as you can see. ( shot of the file which is half blacked out with magic marker) Now, if somebody's trying to bury this case. I'd like to know why. According to your report, Edward Skur disappeared 38 years ago, before you had a chance to arrest him for a series of stranger killings in which the victims' internal organs had all been removed.  ",5,15
MULDER: Yes. last week. Shot to death by a sheriff serving an eviction notice. A man was also found in his bathroom with all his soft tissue removed.  ,5,15
"MULDER: (stopping him) Sir, sir, m-my name is Mulder. (DALES reacts) You know that name... and so did Edward Skur. How?  ",5,15
"MULDER: Uh... I'm sorry, sir. (RING shot #2 as he brushes his hair again) I-I, uh... I don't, I don't see the connection.  ",5,15
"MULDER: (quietly, stopping the tape, recognizing the man) Dad.  ",5,15
"MULDER: (holding a styrofoam cup, RING shot #4) Good morning, Mr. Dales. I brought you some coffee.  ",5,15
MULDER: Edward Skur died saying a name--my name. My father's name.  ,5,15
MULDER: My father and I don't really speak.  ,5,15
"MULDER: (through the door) Mr. Dales, I want the truth, and I will subpoena you to get it, if I have to.  ",5,15
MULDER: The man that Edward Skur killed 38 years ago--was my father involved?  ,5,15
MULDER: How?  ,5,15
MULDER: (who is SMOKING!!!!!) The coroner wasn't able to determine how.  ,5,15
"MULDER: You said in your report that uh, Skur was suspected of being a communist?  ",5,15
"MULDER: (brushing hair out of face, Ring shot #6) I can't believe my father threw in with these men. He let them dictate his conscience.  ",5,15
MULDER: Skur died saying my father's name. Why?  ,5,15
"MULDER: (putting on jacket) Well, there was, um... there was one thing you didn't explain. It was, uh... how Skur was able to get away... how he was able to live in obscurity for the last 38 years.  ",5,15
MULDER: (VO) Why would anyone do that? Why let a killer go free?  ,5,15
MULDER: (looking at slide of dead guy) I have the same pair of pants. Who exterminated him?  ,5,16
"MULDER: Im going to assume the killer knew what he was doing and that ""C"" wasnt one of his initials?  ",5,16
MULDER: (reading) Shes been blind since birth.  ,5,16
"MULDER: ""Fraud ... petty theft .... aggravated assault.""  ",5,16
"MULDER: So, what, you think that uh, she caught Little Monster trying to snatch the pebble from her hand?  ",5,16
MULDER: Including how a blind girl could get the drop on an ex-con and bleed him out with surgical precision.  ,5,16
"MULDER: All right, so you really believe that she did this? You just dont know how.  ",5,16
MULDER: (nods)  ,5,16
MULDER: Well how soon can I meet her?  ,5,16
MULDER: (surprised) Special Agent Mulder.  ,5,16
MULDER: An innocent woman. I hope. (smiles at PENNOCK as they exit the cell)  ,5,16
MULDER: How did you know there was just one stab wound?  ,5,16
MULDER: Mmm hmm.  ,5,16
"MULDER: Im curious, Marty.  ",5,16
"MULDER: If you didnt kill him, why you were at the crime scene cleaning up and doing such a piss poor job of it.  ",5,16
"MULDER: Why dont we just stop playing games here, okay? I mean (laughs) you probably dont know a feather duster from a ducks ass, do you? I mean its ridiculous. Youre a blind woman, for Gods sake. So why dont you just tell us who did kill Paco Ordonez, and Agent Scully and I can go arrest him, and you can go home and work on your angry-young-blind-girl comedy routine.  ",5,16
MULDER: Or we can just ... (he grabs a glass and slams it down on the table in front of him) stay here and entertain each other for the next 48 hours.  ,5,16
MULDER: All I see is a woman whos adapted to her impairment admirably. Shes honed all her other senses around her blindness.  ,5,16
"MULDER: I dunno I - I think she just wants us to think shes strong, independent. (looking at SCULLY) Its important to her. (SCULLY looks up at MULDER)  ",5,16
MULDER: I dont think she did do it.  ,5,16
MULDER: Yeah.  ,5,16
MULDER: You go ahead. I want - I want to  I want to investigate something.  ,5,16
"MULDER: All right, let's, uh, get to it. (Glances up to examiner.)  ",5,16
MULDER: Did you see the murder?  ,5,16
MULDER: Did you see the murder?  ,5,16
MULDER: (On phone) Shes lying.  ,5,16
"MULDER: (on phone) She knew Paco Ordonez, but I dont think she murdered him.  ",5,16
MULDER: (on phone) Well I made her take a polygraph test. She passed on every question except one  did she *see* the murder.  ,5,16
"MULDER: (on phone) No, she cracked, Scully. She was lying. Im sure of it.  ",5,16
MULDER: (on phone) Not with her eyes.  ,5,16
"MULDER: (on phone, voice) I dont know.  ",5,16
"MULDER: Even if the gloves do fit, you can still acquit.  ",5,16
"MULDER: I dont think its that simple. Look at this. (opens a folder) She lives in poverty, but shes never taken advantage of the disability benefits that are available to her.  ",5,16
MULDER: I have no idea. I dont   ,5,16
"MULDER: I think thats the most accurate scenario available to us, right now.  ",5,16
MULDER: What?  ,5,16
MULDER: (disbelieving) You think shes faking it?  ,5,16
MULDER: Then what is that?  ,5,16
"MULDER: What is it, Marty? What do you see?  ",5,16
"MULDER: No. No, according to her examiner, she is completely without sight or any kind of light sensitivity.  ",5,16
"MULDER: She doesnt exactly fit the definition ""blind girl.""  ",5,16
"MULDER: Well, there is evidence of some kind of neurological activity which caused her pupils to dilate.  ",5,16
"MULDER: To me, it indicates some reaction to stimuli. Some kind physical response to images in her minds eye.  ",5,16
MULDER: I didnt say it did.  ,5,16
MULDER: Yes.  ,5,16
"MULDER: Well, she was examined. There were no cuts or wounds on her.  ",5,16
MULDER; Look at her. (They watch MARTY slowly walking) Do you really think shes capable?  ,5,16
MULDER: I read your *confession*. Detective Pennock is typing it up as we speak for you to sign.  ,5,16
MULDER: Youll make him a very happy man.  ,5,16
"MULDER: Just for me, Im a little puzzled by this sudden change of heart.  ",5,16
MULDER: I - I just ... why kill *them*. Paco Ordonez ... Susan Forester? (MARTY looks surprised.) Did you even know that was her name? Susan Forester. She was 30 years old. Native of Wilmington. She waitressed part-time. She lived alone with her two cats...  ,5,16
"MULDER: I *like* you, Marty. I *admire* you. And I dont want to see you confess to crimes you didnt commit.  ",5,16
"MULDER: No, I dont. Not the way you think I do.  ",5,16
"MULDER: I believe you witnessed both murders. You - you saw them, somehow. But you were way cross town when they happened. You were a $60 cab ride away.  ",5,16
"MULDER: I think you tried to stop them. You tried to, but you didnt get there in time.  ",5,16
"MULDER: Marty, whoever did this, theyre going to kill again. And you *can* help stop that.  ",5,16
"MULDER: Whos worth pleading guilty for, Marty?  ",5,16
MULDER: You didnt do it. And Im not going to let this happen. (Officer enters.) Do you hear me? Marty?  ,5,16
MULDER: Congratulations.  ,5,16
"MULDER: Well, all youve got is a signature. No lawyers going to let her go down based on that.  ",5,16
"MULDER: Doesnt it bother you, Detective, that you still have no clear motive?  ",5,16
"MULDER: Well, if you think about it, Detective, it actually proves nothing.  ",5,16
MULDER: Just like she *described.*  ,5,16
MULDER: Skeptical?!  ,5,16
"MULDER: Ive been called a lot of things. Skeptical, however, is not one.  ",5,16
"MULDER: (answers phone, to himself) Skeptical. (on phone)  ",5,16
MULDER: (on phone) What?  ,5,16
"MULDER: (on phone) Well, I know that, and you know that, and so does whoever Martys protecting, but Pennock is salivating right now. What we have to do is convince Marty. I got an idea. Ill get back to you. (hangs up)  ",5,16
"MULDER: I know who youre protecting, Marty. And I think I know why. Youre protecting the man who murdered your mother.  ",5,16
MULDER: I read the original police report from 1970. Your mother died from a single stab wound to the right kidney -- as did Paco Ordonez and Susan Forester. Dead at the hands of an unknown assailant.  ,5,16
MULDER: No. I know. But for once you were there when it happened. She was pregnant with you at the time. She died on the operating table as doctors were trying to save her. You were born ... just barely. But the interruption in blood flow you suffered most likely caused your blindness.  ,5,16
MULDER: I think that during that time ... as you lost one sense ... you gained another. That somehow ... a connection was formed between you and your mothers killer.  ,5,16
"MULDER: You see through his eyes. You always have. You dont want to, you just do. And because of that you feel responsible for his actions, but youre not. And youre sitting here in prison for crimes you didnt commit. It isnt going to accomplish anything, Marty.  ",5,16
"MULDER: Theres absolutely no point to you doing this, Marty. Were going to find him with or without your help.  ",5,16
"MULDER: Hi, Marty.  ",5,16
MULDER: Detective Pennock is with the warden right now arranging for your release.  ,5,16
MULDER: The charges against you are being dropped. Youre no longer a suspect in this case.  ,5,16
"MULDER: Yeah, well, confession is worthless if its a lie, and yours was a lie.  ",5,16
"MULDER: Just that youre innocent, which is something they would have found out on their own anyway. The locker you sent us to? It had prints on it, but they werent yours.  ",5,16
"MULDER: Yeah, well, somebody else wasnt so careful. Charles Wesley Gotts, an ex-con. Convicted in 1970 of aggravated assault. He was paroled three weeks ago and hes been missing ever since.  ",5,16
"MULDER: I happen to believe that, Marty. The PCR tests confirmed that it was his blood on the glove. The tests confirmed something else, Marty. Hes your father. (MARTY is shocked.) That was the connection. (MARTY is on verge of tears.)  ",5,16
"MULDER: (hard for him to say) Detective Pennock has agreed to not pursue aiding and abetting charges if you agree to help us ... if you agree to help us find him. We need your help, Marty. You can end it now.  ",5,16
MULDER: Im sure thats what youve always wanted.  ,5,16
"MULDER: All right, stand by.  ",5,16
MULDER: Just in time for the surprise party.  ,5,16
"MULDER: Yeah, she described this place perfectly, right down to the matchbooks.  ",5,16
MULDER; She wants to stop him.  ,5,16
MULDER: She didnt know his name. Theyve never met. Hes been in prison her entire life.  ,5,16
MULDER: I - I dont think she was sure exactly what she was seeing but it was more like a - a constant image in her mind that she learned to live with over time. Up until three weeks ago.  ,5,16
MULDER: He was paroled and everything changed.  ,5,16
"MULDER: Everythings changed for her, Scully. I dont think were going to find him in there.  ",5,16
MULDER: She doesnt want us to get him. She misdirected us on purpose.  ,5,16
"MULDER: No, shes not. She never was. (hangs up) Pennocks not picking up.  ",5,16
"MULDER: Its not him shes been protecting. If he goes back to prison, so does she. Until now, shes never had a choice. (Gets in drivers side of car.)  ",5,16
MULDER: Is it my cologne?  ,5,16
"MULDER: Marty, let me speak to the judge on your behalf.  ",5,16
MULDER: We found where hed been staying. It was a motel not far from where Paco Ordonez had been murdered.  ,5,16
"MULDER: Well, youre lucky he wasnt a fan of the Ice Capades.  ",5,16
"MULDER: (on phone, impatient) Hey, Scully. Im returning your call. (checks his watch)  ",5,17
MULDER: (on phone) Why? Whats going on?  ,5,17
"MULDER: (on phone) Hey, look, Im, uh  Im kind of tailing a possible suspect right now, so Im kind of rushed, so, uh   ",5,17
MULDER: (on phone) Who?  ,5,17
MULDER: (on phone) You want to give me a hint? Anything?  ,5,17
"MULDER: (on phone) All right, Ill talk to you later.  ",5,17
MULDER: Scully? Arent you the secret squirrel.  ,5,17
MULDER: Just got a look at that body they wheeled out of here. Youve been holding out on me.  ,5,17
MULDER: Dara Kernofs family?  ,5,17
"MULDER: No, those are her birth records. The adoption records have been sealed.  ",5,17
"MULDER: No. Actually she was a quadruplet  one of four girls. Was this, uh  cross found like this?  ",5,17
"MULDER: Its inverted. Upside down. Thats a protest, a sacrilege against the church.  ",5,17
"MULDER: Its your case, remember, Scully? Do you have any suspects?  ",5,17
"MULDER: Could the, uh, the victim have placed it?  ",5,17
MULDER: And they both died the same way?  ,5,17
MULDER: Their physical deformities could account for that.  ,5,17
"MULDER: Look, Scully. I know you dont really want my help on this, but can I offer you my professional opinion? (SCULLY nods.) Youve got a bona-fide, super-crazy, religious wacko on your hands.  ",5,17
"MULDER: The mote in the eye, the eyes as windows to the soul, an eye for an eye  hes working from ancient scripture  ancient text  Maybe even the Bible. He may even think hes doing Gods work.  ",5,17
"MULDER: Scully, look at this. (Begins thumbing through it.) The Gnostic Gospels, Book of Enoch  Book of J  Apocrypha  Im surprised theres nothing here from ""Jesus Christ Superstar"".  ",5,17
MULDER: Theres no telling.  ,5,17
MULDER: (suspicious) We hear you were very anxious to do so.  ,5,17
MULDER: Why adopt her?  ,5,17
MULDER: Why adopt her?  ,5,17
MULDER: You said you wanted to protect Paula. From what?  ,5,17
"MULDER: I know people in glass houses shouldnt throw stones, blah, blah, blah, but that guy is paranoid.  ",5,17
"MULDER: All that crap about the fight for All Souls, the literature we saw in there, the performance we just witnessed  it all fits. He thinks hes doing Gods laundry.  ",5,17
"MULDER: If he does, hes even more dangerous than he appears. Even if hes not your killer, he is hiding something.  ",5,17
"MULDER: Well, he says he knew the mother, but wont give up her name. Maybe shes still alive. I think you have enough to bring him in for questioning if not make an arrest.  ",5,17
MULDER: (slowly) What  do  you mean?  ,5,17
MULDER: And why would God allow this to happen. Why do bad things happen to good people? Religion has masqueraded as the paranormal since the dawn of time to justify some of the most horrible acts in history.  ,5,17
"MULDER: He may well have His reasons but He seems to use a lot of psychotics to carry out His job orders. You want to find out who did this? I suggest you autopsy the body of Paula Koklos before its interred, before the man who killed her has a chance to find her sisters. (Gets in driver's side of the car.)   ",5,17
"MULDER: (on phone, voice) Hey, Scully, its me. I did a little more digging on those adoption records.  ",5,17
"MULDER: (on phone, driving slowly - in sunglasses) I think I got a lead on that third sister.  ",5,17
"MULDER: (on phone) She was under county care ten years ago. Apparently, she wandered into a teen crisis center here in DC last week, homeless. That guy over at, uh, social services, Starkey  hes helping me canvas the area. (Stops the car and begins walking, followed by STARKEY.)  ",5,17
MULDER: (on phone) What did you find?  ,5,17
"MULDER: (on phone) Well, then, maybe she flew here, Scully.  ",5,17
MULDER: (on phone) Why dont you hold that thought and tell it to me and Father Gregory when you see us?  ,5,17
MULDER: Stop right there! Move into the light. Move into the light. Hands where I can see them!  ,5,17
MULDER: Wheres the girl?  ,5,17
MULDER: Where is she?  ,5,17
"MULDER: What are you asking for, Father? Mercy or forgiveness? You know they say when you talk to God its prayer, but when God talks to you, its schizophrenia. What is your God telling you, Father?  ",5,17
MULDER: You pray for their souls now. Thats convenient.  ,5,17
"MULDER: I am only interested in the truth. I would like to know why you did what you did to three defenseless, helpless young girls. What in your sick mind would possess you to burn their eyes out! Did they see you for who you are, like I do? (Pushes upside down cross pendant toward him.) What does this mean, Father?  ",5,17
"MULDER: (reentering) Scully, they think theyve found the fourth girl.  ",5,17
"MULDER: The fourth girl is Roberta Dyer. Transferred to Maryland Adoption Services in 1995 when her foster father got a job in Gaithersburg. Adoption services were called out to investigate allegations of child abuse in September of that year. Three more times in 96, then two more times in 97.  ",5,17
MULDER: Whats wrong?  ,5,17
"MULDER: Scully? Scully, dont let this guy get in your head. Thats the last thing you want. Sometimes the most twisted ones are the most persuasive.  ",5,17
"MULDER: Well, thats okay. As long as hes locked up here, it doesnt matter.  ",5,17
"MULDER: By who? Scully, I think youre the one whos being misled. Not just willingly, but willfully. Ive never seen you more vulnerable or susceptible or more easily manipulated and it scares me because I dont know why.  ",5,17
"MULDER: I think you should step away. Personal issues are making you lose your objectivity, clouding your judgement.  ",5,17
MULDER: Okay.  ,5,17
MULDER: We have a warrant to search the premises for your daughter.  ,5,17
MULDER: We checked at school. She hasnt been there in over a week. We have reason to believe that her life may be in danger. If you know something  (Tries door under stairs.) Whats behind this door?  ,5,17
"MULDER: Well, can you unlock it?  ",5,17
"MULDER: (angry) Is this her room? Where is she, Mr. Dyer? Where is she?!  ",5,17
MULDER: Where is she?!  ,5,17
MULDER: Who?  ,5,17
MULDER: Who?!  ,5,17
"MULDER: (on phone, voice) Yeah, hi, Scully. Its me.  ",5,17
"MULDER: (on phone, voice) Who?  ",5,17
"MULDER: (on phone, voice) We didnt find her. The fourth girl  she was here.  ",5,17
"MULDER: (on phone, voice) Hey, Scully. Scully, you there? Answer me. Scully? Scully!  ",5,17
MULDER: (running after HALEY) Im on him!  ,5,18
MULDER: Scully.  ,5,18
MULDER: I lost him.  ,5,18
MULDER: (not looking at her) He got away.  ,5,18
"MULDER: ""What happened?""  ",5,18
MULDER: (not looking at her) I dont know what youre talking about.  ,5,18
MULDER: Were late for the hearing.  ,5,18
MULDER: Were not all dead?  ,5,18
MULDER: Haleys extremely suspicious to the point of paranoia. Hes got military training and a guerrilla mentality.  ,5,18
MULDER: (on phone) Yeah?  ,5,18
MULDER: I saved your ass.  ,5,18
"MULDER: (on phone, voice) I didnt know about the operation.  ",5,18
MULDER: (on phone) No. The Justice Department got an anonymous tip. I found out a half hour before it went down. I did what I could.  ,5,18
"MULDER: (on phone) What else can I say? I-I got as much to lose here as you do. They catch you, youll flip me. Look, I believe in your ideals and your goals but the only reason I tolerate your methods is because the governments are worse.  ",5,18
"MULDER: (on phone) Hey, you came to me, remember? I mean, what more do you want from me? Ive risked everything. Ive given you information. My partner is seriously suspicious. If thats not enough for you, thats all Ive got. (hangs up)  ",5,18
MULDER: (on phone) Yeah?  ,5,18
"MULDER: (still wearing the hood) Ooh. Is this the Pepsi challenge? How bout some, uh, fresh air, boys?  ",5,18
"MULDER: Okay, deal me in.  ",5,18
"MULDER: Well, you might want to put that hood back on me unless you want to see a grown man cry.  ",5,18
MULDER: I told you on the phone.  ,5,18
"MULDER: I was set up. Im telling the truth. Wait, wait! Wait! I let you go!  ",5,18
MULDER: No. No. No.  ,5,18
MULDER: You want me to lie and say yes?  ,5,18
"MULDER: (to FBM) Im going to kill you, you son of a bitch! Im going to kill you! (to HALEY) If I set you up you think Id even get into the car with this Nazi piece of shi!  ",5,18
"MULDER: (in lots of pain) I risked everything! If I was lying, thered be federal agents descending on this place like the wrath of God right now. (to FBM) If you touch me again, youd better kill me!  ",5,18
MULDER: (weakly) Yeah.  ,5,18
"MULDER: No, I didnt set you up. If you got set up, it was one of yours.  ",5,18
"MULDER: (startled, then rubs his face tiredly with his good hand) Scully, get out of here.  ",5,18
MULDER: Get out of here!  ,5,18
MULDER: I dont know what youre talking about  ,5,18
MULDER: Nothing.  ,5,18
"MULDER: Yeah, if you keep pulling it around like that.  ",5,18
MULDER: 14 people? That doesnt make any sense.  ,5,18
"MULDER: (voice) Theyre testing me, too. Haleys paranoid  and spooked. I was sure he was going to kill me.  ",5,18
MULDER: (voice) They still need something from me  and Im sensing theres someone Haley trusts even less  The man giving him his orders. Someone I havent met yet. A guy named August Bremer.  ,5,18
MULDER: Terrorist lie detector.  ,5,18
"MULDER: Well, I must have. Im still here. They told me what they want. Documentation from the federal reserve bank. Fund transfer schedules for the eastern seaboard. Cash money.  ",5,18
MULDER: I think I convinced Haley that the near miss in Folger Park was due to a mole inside his own group. He wants surveillance files on them.  ,5,18
MULDER: Theyre waiting for my call.  ,5,18
MULDER: (leaving the room) If you dont hear from me by midnight  feed my fish.  ,5,18
MULDER: Tell the gimp to back off.  ,5,18
MULDER: I need that back by tomorrow.  ,5,18
MULDER: No.  ,5,18
MULDER: I have my beliefs.  ,5,18
MULDER: Id prefer it didnt come to that.  ,5,18
MULDER: Right.  ,5,18
MULDER: I got it!  ,5,18
MULDER: No. Hes still alive.  ,5,18
MULDER: What are you doing? What are you doing?  ,5,18
MULDER: The bank heist was a decoy. To contaminate the money you didnt take.  ,5,18
"MULDER: (taped) They're testing me, too. Haley's paranoid... and spooked. I was sure he was going to kill me.  ",5,18
MULDER: (taped) They still need something from me. And I'm sensing there's someone Haley trusts even less.  ,5,18
"MULDER: I dont need a car. You can just call me a cab, thatd be fine.  ",5,18
MULDER: Go where?  ,5,18
MULDER: (to the FINGER BREAKING MAN) You hear that?  ,5,18
MULDER: Who are you?  ,5,18
MULDER: FBI. Whos in charge? Whos in charge? I need everybody out of the bank!  ,5,18
MULDER: The money! They sprayed the money.  ,5,18
MULDER: How did you know it was this bank?  ,5,18
MULDER: With the ?  ,5,18
"MULDER: August Bremer, or whatever his real name is  hes working with us.  ",5,18
MULDER: Youre saying I was set up?  ,5,18
MULDER: I was being used? This whole operation? The people who died in that theatre?  ,5,18
MULDER: The hell they arent. Those were tests on us to be used on someone else.  ,5,18
MULDER: I want that money rechecked.  ,5,18
"MULDER: That moneys as dirty as you are, isnt it. Isnt it?  ",5,18
MULDER: I want people to know the truth.  ,5,18
MULDER: Why cant the Chicago field office take care of it?  ,5,19
MULDER: (challenging) Because the manifesto contains bizarre overtones  claims of a paranormal nature?  ,5,19
MULDER: (sarcastically) Monsters. Im your boy.  ,5,19
MULDER: I mustve done something to piss him off.  ,5,19
MULDER: Get stuck with this jerk-off assignment or have I finally reached that magic point in my career where every time somebody sees Bigfoot or the Virgin Mary on a tortilla I get called to offer my special insight on the matter? (rubs his forehead showing his still taped fingers)  ,5,19
"MULDER: Not yours, anyway. Theres no reason both of us should go to Chicago. Ill take care of it.  ",5,19
"MULDER: Im monster boy, right?  ",5,19
MULDER: You recognize the voice?  ,5,19
MULDER: Your company had a violent incident in its recent history?  ,5,19
MULDER: May I borrow the tape?  ,5,19
"MULDER: Well, its best to err on the side of caution. Can you hire security for the building?  ",5,19
MULDER: Use you best judgement. Ill be in touch.  ,5,19
"MULDER: (on phone) Its a phrase, ""Hiding in the light."" Its on this tape that Im looking into.  ",5,19
"MULDER: (on phone) Yes, and I didnt say that it wasnt. Uh, ""To hide in the light"" or ""Hiding in the light""  some form of that. I think its in an old case file somewhere that I got hidden away.  ",5,19
"MULDER: (on phone) Im not sure, but I appreciate it. (hangs up)  ",5,19
MULDER: (on phone) Mulder.  ,5,19
MULDER: (on phone) What was he describing?  ,5,19
MULDER: (on phone) He was trying to warn them?  ,5,19
"MULDER: (on phone) Scully, at the risk of you telling me ""I told you so"" I think its time for you to get down here and help me.  ",5,19
MULDER: Hello .. hello?  ,5,19
"MULDER: Why should we be afraid of Mr. Pincus, Gary? Id really like to hear what you have to say.  ",5,19
MULDER: My name is Mulder.  ,5,19
MULDER: Applying for a job.  ,5,19
"MULDER: I get that. Why should we be afraid of Mr. Pincus, Gary?  ",5,19
"MULDER: Gary, I want to believe that youre protecting us, but, uh, Im kind of afraid of that rifle. It makes it hard for us actual people to concentrate on what youre saying.  ",5,19
MULDER: Gary!  ,5,19
MULDER: Its just my cell phone. Let me get it.  ,5,19
"MULDER: Its not an it, Gary. Its a he. Its a man you just killed. What was his name?  ",5,19
"MULDER: Answer the phone, Gary.  ",5,19
"MULDER: No, Gary.  ",5,19
MULDER: Dont do this.  ,5,19
"MULDER: Dont do this, Gary.  ",5,19
MULDER: Put down the rifle.  ,5,19
"MULDER: No, Im fine.  ",5,19
MULDER: Do you have any idea why he fixated on you the way he did?  ,5,19
MULDER: You mentioned another incident with another employee at a plant in Kansas City in 1994.  ,5,19
MULDER: Were you at that plant at that time?  ,5,19
"MULDER: What about Lakeland, Florida. Have you ever lived there?  ",5,19
MULDER: (walking away from her) I dont know.  ,5,19
"MULDER: Close the door. There was a reason the phrase ""hiding in the light"" seemed so familiar to me. I found it or variations of it in five other X-Files. ""Hiding in plain view"" ""Hiding in the open"" ""Lurking in the open."" All to describe some sort of manifestation of evil which goes unnoticed be everyone except the claimant in each case.  ",5,19
MULDER: Seven cities in all dating back ten years. VinylRight has offices within 50 miles of 4 of those cities. Greg Pincus has worked for VinylRight for ten years.  ,5,19
MULDER: What if Gary Lambert was right?  ,5,19
"MULDER: Just bear with me for a moment. What if such a creature existed that could camouflage itself by clouding the minds of its victims? There are antecedents for it in nature. In the insect world, mantids are said to hypnotize their prey.  ",5,19
MULDER: What if it could induce a visual hallucination  a sort of temporary conversion disorder?  ,5,19
"MULDER: Only Gary Lambert could see through it somehow, as could the others  maybe because of some heightened adrenaline level of maybe just because he knew where to look somehow.  ",5,19
"MULDER: Yeah, but did he see it because he was disturbed, or was he disturbed because he saw it?  ",5,19
"MULDER: I saw it, too. (worried, really asking her) Does that make me disturbed? Demented? Does that make me sick, too?  ",5,19
"MULDER: Folie A Deux? Its not that, Scully. Its not Helsinki Syndrome either. What I saw was real, and there may be a way to prove it.  ",5,19
"MULDER: Lambert pointed out certain individuals he said had been victimized by Pincus, turned into zombies. The man he shot, Backus was one of them. If you would autopsy the body   ",5,19
"MULDER: Scully, if this is all in my mind I would be very grateful if you would prove that.  ",5,19
MULDER: Then Ill prove it without you. (gets up to leave the office)  ,5,19
MULDER: Ill know it when I see it.  ,5,19
MULDER: Lambert was tracking his bosss movements over the years.  ,5,19
MULDER: Gathering evidence.  ,5,19
MULDER: Did you see her? You see where she went?  ,5,19
"MULDER: (to PINCUS) You got to her, too, didnt you?  ",5,19
MULDER: I was too late. You changed her somehow. You infected her.  ,5,19
MULDER: You dont see whats going on here.  ,5,19
"MULDER: (to PINCUS) Lambert knew your secret. He knew you were sucking the humanity out of these people, feeding on them!  ",5,19
MULDER: (drawing his gun and pushing SKINNER out of the way) Get out of the way!  ,5,19
MULDER: Look at it!  ,5,19
MULDER: (drops gun) Look at it! Look at it!  ,5,19
"MULDER: Five years together, Scully. You must have seen this coming. (laughs softly) Did you examine Backus body? What did you find?  ",5,19
"MULDER: ""More or less?"" What is that supposed to mean?  ",5,19
"MULDER: Or, that Lambert was telling the truth and that man was dead before he was gunned down.  ",5,19
"MULDER: Scully .. When that monster, Pincus  whatever the hell you want to call it  when he attacked that woman last night he did something to the back of her neck. H-he bit her there, or he injected something in there. Theres got to be evidence of that. You got to check for that.  ",5,19
MULDER: (desperate) *You* have to be willing to see.  ,5,19
"MULDER: Scully, you *have* to believe me. Nobody else on this whole damn planet does or ever will. Youre my one in  five billion.  ",5,19
"MULDER: (innocently) We can do without these, huh? What do you say?  ",5,19
MULDER: Nurse. Nurse! Nurse! Its here! Nurse! Its here! (NURSE opens the curtain.) Its here! Its at the window!  ,5,19
MULDER: (trying to sound calm and rational) There is something  there is something at the window and its trying to get in here. Please unstrap me so that I can stop it.  ,5,19
MULDER: Undo my straps so I can check.  ,5,19
"MULDER: No, dont! No! Just please ! Please.  ",5,19
"MULDER: Okay. Just, uh  just untie me anyway please.  ",5,19
MULDER: What are you doing?  ,5,19
MULDER: (yelling) Help! Somebody help!  ,5,19
MULDER: Help! Help! Help!  ,5,19
MULDER: What did you tell him?  ,5,19
MULDER: Which is?  ,5,19
"MULDER: Wow, you know youre going places in the Bureau when the Assistant Director tidies up your office for you. Whats up?  ",5,20
MULDER: For anything special?  ,5,20
MULDER: My long term plans? You got them right there in your hands.  ,5,20
MULDER: Whatever I hope to find is in here. And maybe Ill know it when I find it. Is that what you came to ask me?  ,5,20
MULDER: You give it to him?  ,5,20
MULDER: (Mr. Congeniality) Please continue.  ,5,20
"MULDER: Im  sorry, can you rewind the tape? Please. Ill tell you where. Just take it back?  ",5,20
MULDER: I dont have any questions. No. I just think youre wrong.  ,5,20
MULDER: I dont think the Russian was the target. I think it was his opponent.  ,5,20
"MULDER: And a good chess player. Here, let me show you his best move, if youll just take it back.  ",5,20
"MULDER: Okay, stop it there. Look what the kid does right here, right before the kill shot. Play. Do you see what he does? He just pushes back. You see that?  ",5,20
"MULDER: You described a steep trajectory for the kill shot. If the kid doesnt push back at that precise moment he catches the bullet in the back of the neck, not the Russian.  ",5,20
"MULDER: More or less, yeah.  ",5,20
MULDER: Hi. My name is Fox. This is Dana and Diana. How are you doing?  ,5,20
MULDER: Whats wrong with Baywatch?  ,5,20
MULDER: How do you know I want to?  ,5,20
MULDER: Its not so cheap. Dont you want to see how fast you can beat it?  ,5,20
MULDER: Maybe because you cant.  ,5,20
"MULDER: Im right, arent I? You know what Im talking about. You knew the moment I came in. Thats how you win, isnt it  how you know what your opponents going to do? You get inside his head. You read his thoughts. Thats how you knew that man was going to shoot you  isnt it?  ",5,20
MULDER: Oh?  ,5,20
MULDER: This kids going to need round-the-clock protection.  ,5,20
"MULDER: The kids no chess master. Under controlled conditions, I could probably beat him.  ",5,20
MULDER: With the most unfair advantage. What hes doing amounts to a kind of parlor magic trick.  ,5,20
"MULDER: Weve seen a number of these cases before, Scully.  ",5,20
MULDER: Maybe thats why they want him dead.  ,5,20
MULDER: Im not the mind reader.  ,5,20
"MULDER: Well, lets test him. I think the kid will stand up. Lets run a brain scan and a psych evaluation on him. (looking away) You know what to do, Diana.  ",5,20
MULDER: I want to talk to the shooter.  ,5,20
MULDER: (reaching for the door) Okay. Let me see what I can do.  ,5,20
"MULDER: When I first met you I figured you were just ambitious. This morning, my opinion changed. I thought you were arrogant. Now Im beginning to wonder what youre protecting.  ",5,20
"MULDER: Youre insulting me when you should be taking notes. Somehow, you got the big assignment but just because youre wearing the suit doesnt mean it fits. Youre lucky youre not defusing some international incident kissing serious Russian ass and sending a lot of agents barking down a lot of bad leads. Now, the kid is the key to this and the shooter knows why. Excuse me.  ",5,20
MULDER: What does it take to kill a kid? Money? Or just evil stupidity?  ,5,20
MULDER: No  Thanks to the kid.  ,5,20
"MULDER: I wont tolerate that. Spender, you got to get this guy some food. Come on.  ",5,20
"MULDER: Yeah  I read your bio. Youve been trained. Special Forces. You were in Grenada, Zaire. You were inside Saddams palace with a hit squad when they started raining bombs down over it yet you failed to kill him as well.  ",5,20
"MULDER: (interrupting) Yeah, I know  you got nothing to say. (sits beside him on the bed) Thats okay. Im a pretty good guesser. The kid reads minds. Hows that? Why dont I tell him you told me that, and then lets see how safe and snug you feel in here.  ",5,20
"MULDER: I dont know. I might be able to get you immunity or, uh  get you into the witness protection program.  ",5,20
MULDER: Think about it.  ,5,20
MULDER: Just his attention.  ,5,20
MULDER: Hows little Karnac doing?  ,5,20
MULDER: Theres something else. Theres something were missing here.  ,5,20
"MULDER: (embarrassed, looking away) Oh, you would have caught it eventually.  ",5,20
"MULDER: Thats all I do. Thats all Ive been doing for the last five years. Been my life, such as it is. (smiles)  ",5,20
"MULDER: Ah, wed all be blown up by some terrorist bomb, no doubt, huh?  ",5,20
"MULDER: Oh, you mean Scully?  ",5,20
"MULDER: Shes a, uh ... shes a scientist. She just makes me work for everything.  ",5,20
MULDER: Ive done okay without you.  ,5,20
"MULDER: (on phone, voice) Mulder.  ",5,20
"MULDER: (on phone, voice, pause) Where are you?  ",5,20
"MULDER: (on phone) Well, Im at the psych facility with him right now. Why dont you come by and show me?  ",5,20
"MULDER: (on phone) Okay, what is it?  ",5,20
MULDER: (on phone) Im on my way.  ,5,20
"MULDER: Agent Spender! Agent Spender? (looks for CSM, but doesnt see him) Who were you talking to?  ",5,20
MULDER: You dont know who you were talking to? Youre lying.  ,5,20
MULDER: I was told he was dead.  ,5,20
MULDER: (to SCULLY) Tell him exactly as you told me.  ,5,20
"MULDER: There are corollaries  The individuals who have been responsible for great leaps forward in understanding in science. Newton, Galileo, Einstein, Stephen Hawking. All these men exhibited modes of thinking that are suggestive of access to special brain centers.  ",5,20
"MULDER: This kid may be the key not just to all human potential, but to all spiritual unexplained paranormal phenomena. The key to everything in the X-Files.  ",5,20
"MULDER: No, its bigger than that.  ",5,20
MULDER: I cant. But the shooter can. The assassin that you have locked up ... in exchange for immunity from prosecution.  ,5,20
"MULDER: If what Agent Scullys found is true and I have every reason to believe that it is, then the answers I might have spent a lifetime searching for may fall together like a million puzzle pieces.  ",5,20
MULDER: How soon can you call the Attorney General?  ,5,20
MULDER: The Attorney Generals heard my request for immunity.  ,5,20
MULDER: She needs something more. Something to convince her that youre not just playing games. Something that I can corroborate. I need answers from you.  ,5,20
MULDER: To what?  ,5,20
"MULDER: Hes genetic proof, isnt he?  ",5,20
MULDER: The kids not superhuman. Hes just more human than human.  ,5,20
"MULDER: Most of us have genes we dont use. They lie there dormant, turned off. Science doesnt know what theyre for, why theyre there or where they came from.  ",5,20
MULDER: Theres a long-held but unpopular theory tied to prehistoric evidence of alien astronauts.  ,5,20
MULDER: Wheres Spender?  ,5,20
MULDER: Who do you work for?! You work for him -- You and Old Smokey --- Is that who put this together?! Youre going down for this! Im going to see you prosecuted for murder! You watch me! Watch it happen! Your days are numbered!  ,5,20
MULDER: (not opening his eyes) Any news on Diana?  ,5,20
MULDER: What did Skinner have to say?  ,5,20
MULDER: (looking up at her) For who?  ,5,20
MULDER: This was all strategized  every move. I just couldnt see it. It was all of a plan.  ,5,20
MULDER: Using a process that restores moisture to the documents and by a reassembling of fragments I should be able to recover a large percentage of the case material that was destroyed in my office fire several months ago... And while this process will be tedious and ongoing what I've already recovered will allow Agent Scully and I to begin work on the X-Files immediately.  ,6,1
MULDER: Yes.  ,6,1
"MULDER: The ice had become superheated by the ship as it rose beneath us, causing the ice to collapse.  ",6,1
"MULDER: Well, I was hoping that you'd look more closely at the reports of mine and Agent Scully's medical conditions.  ",6,1
MULDER: (pause) I didn't see Men in Black.  ,6,1
MULDER: As much as this all may sound like science-fiction we can and will prove the validity of our report.  ,6,1
MULDER: A shadow conspiracy within our own government.  ,6,1
MULDER: Which we will prove now that the X-Files have been reopened.  ,6,1
MULDER: I'm not sure I understand.  ,6,1
"MULDER: (the big speech) Agent Scully was assigned to the X-Files as a scientist, was stung by one of these bees and was infected with this virus. She is here today with hard and incontrovertible evidence... Scientific proof that the virus she was infected with is, in fact, extraterrestrial.  ",6,1
"MULDER: Next time, I'll wear a clown suit and do balloon tricks.  ",6,1
MULDER: The only reason I was in there was because you assured me there was a scientific basis for what we saw.  ,6,1
"MULDER: Look, Scully, that excuse is not going to work this time. You were there and you were infected with that virus.  ",6,1
MULDER: I saw what that virus did. I saw it generate a new being... An alien being inside a human body.  ,6,1
MULDER: You need evidence to justify our reassignment. I've just got to bring it back from the ashes.  ,6,1
MULDER: (angry) How can it be denied? We're the only reason the X-Files were reopened in the first place. There's no other reason to reopen them.  ,6,1
"MULDER: Well, then, who is?  ",6,1
MULDER: Was there a vote?  ,6,1
MULDER: (coldly) Excuse me.  ,6,1
"MULDER: Inside or out, I don't see that there's a damn thing you can do for me.  ",6,1
MULDER: I don't have that proof just yet.  ,6,1
"MULDER: (setting the file down) Yeah, if you're doing my filing.  ",6,1
"MULDER: What are you doing in my office, Agent Spender?  ",6,1
MULDER: If you're about to tell me that you were sent down here to work on the X-Files I think the failure is simple judgment. I don't care what patronage got you this job. I put my life in here. I'm not going to let some brown-nose just slide in and take it all away from me.  ,6,1
MULDER: No? Who is?  ,6,1
"MULDER: (giving a weak thumbs-up) Diana, back on your feet. (picks up his box of files and heads out the door) I guess that's the only way you could stab me in the back.  ",6,1
"MULDER: (from the hall) Scully, come here and take a look at this. Ever seen anything like this?  ",6,1
MULDER: According to the investigator's notes in the file they're from an attack by a Native American man on a scientist.  ,6,1
MULDER: It says in the file he used his bare hands.  ,6,1
MULDER: Uh-huh.  ,6,1
MULDER: Aw. Somebody broke a nail.  ,6,1
MULDER: It ain't RuPaul. (reading) The body of the other victim was found here on the sofa his viscera torn from his torso. But the MEs report says that the times of death were hours apart which means that this victim was dead hours before the second attack.  ,6,1
MULDER: There wasn't an attack. I think it was celebrating its birthday. The first victim must have gotten infected with the virus somehow. Right here on the sofa was where the creature was born.  ,6,1
MULDER: That would account for the violence done to the man's torso. The virus producing an extraterrestrial biological entity that ripped away his chest as it birthed itself right here. Look.  ,6,1
MULDER: That's exactly what I'm saying.  ,6,1
MULDER: I don't see there's any argument here. You admit yourself that the crime report is a lie.  ,6,1
"MULDER: What does it take? For this thing to come up and bite you on the ass? I saw these creatures. I saw them burst to life. You would've seen them, too but you were infected with that virus. You were passed out over my shoulder.  ",6,1
"MULDER: I'm talking about extraterrestrial life alive on this planet in our lifetime. Forces that dwarf and precede all human history. I'm sorry, Scully, but this time your science is wrong. (walks away from her)  ",6,1
MULDER: What happened here?  ,6,1
MULDER: Let us through.  ,6,1
"MULDER: Diana, let us in here.  ",6,1
MULDER: A man was murdered.  ,6,1
MULDER: Then why are you here?  ,6,1
MULDER: There is a connection.  ,6,1
"MULDER: I hope you know what you're doing, Diana. I hope you know whose errand you're running.  ",6,1
"MULDER: It's here, Scully, and they know it.  ",6,1
MULDER: Give me the keys and get in the car.  ,6,1
MULDER: They were butchers.  ,6,1
MULDER: How did you get in our car?  ,6,1
MULDER: Why are you here?  ,6,1
MULDER: The kid could find this thing.  ,6,1
MULDER: We could get his fever down.  ,6,1
MULDER: We don't have the X-Files.  ,6,1
"MULDER: (not wanting to deal with her) Diana, what are you doing here?  ",6,1
MULDER: I'm listening.  ,6,1
MULDER: Who sent you?  ,6,1
MULDER: Why? To convince me of your noble intentions?  ,6,1
MULDER: You take Gibson.  ,6,1
MULDER: To find this thing.  ,6,1
MULDER: With who?  ,6,1
MULDER: Who removed it?  ,6,1
MULDER: Maybe that's why it's there. It wants heat. It needs heat. This thing gestated abnormally fast. What if heat activates it? It could spur on the virus and the rapid development of the entity. But it's still seeking heat. Why?  ,6,1
MULDER: No.  ,6,1
MULDER: It's hot in here.  ,6,1
MULDER: Maybe somebody's got the flu.  ,6,1
MULDER: There's something in there.  ,6,1
MULDER: (on phone) Yeah.  ,6,1
MULDER: (on phone) Ditto.  ,6,1
MULDER: (on phone) The same virus you were exposed to?  ,6,1
"MULDER: (on phone) What does that mean, Scully?  ",6,1
MULDER: (on phone) I'll call that bet and raise you.  ,6,1
MULDER: (on phone) Never mind. Just take care of Gibson.  ,6,1
"MULDER: Open the door, you son of a bitch! Open the door! Open it! Open it! Open the door, you...  ",6,1
MULDER: Open it! Open the door!  ,6,1
MULDER: Gibson! Gibson! Gibson!  ,6,1
MULDER: Gibson! Gibson! Gibson! Gibson!  ,6,1
MULDER: It would help if you'd shut the door. It would make it harder for them to see that I'm totally disregarding everything I was told.  ,6,1
"MULDER: They can't take away the X-Files, Scully. They tried.  ",6,1
MULDER: (not looking at her) Agent Fowley's report was a means to an end. Trying to protect the work. Protect the X-Files.  ,6,1
"MULDER: Agent Fowley took me to that plant at great risk to herself where I saw something that you refuse to believe in. Saw it again, Scully. And though it may not say it in her report, Diana saw it, too. And no matter what you think she's certainly not going to go around saying that just because science can't prove it isn't true.  ",6,1
MULDER: You asking me to make a choice?  ,6,1
MULDER: I can't accept that. Not if it refutes what I know to be true.  ,6,1
MULDER: That's the connection.  ,6,1
MULDER: Wait a minute. I don't understand. You're saying that Gibson Praise is infected with the virus?  ,6,1
"MULDER: So if that were true, that would mean that Gibson is in some part extraterrestrial.  ",6,1
MULDER: But we do have a free copy of the Watchtower for you if you'd like.  ,6,2
"MULDER: (quietly to SCULLY) So routine, it numbs the mind.  ",6,2
"MULDER: Hey, Scully, take a look at this.  ",6,2
"MULDER: (on phone) Thank you, Captain. That's no problem. We'd be happy to help. Mm-hmm.  ",6,2
MULDER: (on phone) See you soon. (hangs up)  ,6,2
"MULDER: Come on, Scully. Just one quick side trip.  ",6,2
"MULDER: Running down people that buy fertilizer? This is scut work, bozo work-- the FBI equivalent of being made to wear an orange jumpsuit and pick up trash by the side of the highway-- they mean to humiliate us.  ",6,2
MULDER: You saw that news report. What did you make of that?  ,6,2
"MULDER: In the words of their captain ""she just sort of popped."" And what about this guy who supposedly tried to take her hostage, her husband? Looked to me like he was trying to warn the cops before she died. Now, the sun will rise in America tomorrow regardless of whether or not we're at yet another farm investigating yet another enormous pile of doo-doo. We can be in and out in a day. Nobody has to know.  ",6,2
MULDER: Why can't we see him?  ,6,2
MULDER: 40-year-old roofer. No history of mental illness. No prior record.  ,6,2
MULDER: What do you think?  ,6,2
MULDER: I'm going to stay here and see if I can see Crump.  ,6,2
"MULDER: Captain, where's Montello?  ",6,2
MULDER: So that's where it started. That's Crump's home. Then he headed east in this direction on the 5 about ten miles to the Utah border where he stole the car.  ,6,2
"MULDER: Yeah, but you caught up with him in Wells. Where's that?  ",6,2
"MULDER: So that means that he started off in this direction. Then all of a sudden, he turned around and he headed west... To Wells. Why?  ",6,2
"MULDER: (on phone, voice) Yeah.  ",6,2
"MULDER: (on phone, voice) Yeah.  ",6,2
"MULDER: (on phone, voice) Uh-huh.  ",6,2
"MULDER: (on phone, voice) (sighs)  ",6,2
"MULDER: (on phone) Well, that's going to be a little tough, Scully.  ",6,2
"MULDER: How about if we just pull over and let me out, too, huh? I must be cramping your style.  ",6,2
MULDER: What figures?  ,6,2
"MULDER: Hey! No! (furious) That is... so stupid, Crump.  ",6,2
MULDER: That is so stupid.  ,6,2
MULDER: What? What am I doing?  ,6,2
MULDER: (sarcastically) I'm composing a sonnet. I'm slowing down for a light.  ,6,2
"MULDER: Crump? Is this what happened to your wife? This same thing? If you stop moving, you die? I think I saw this movie. Why didn't you tell anybody? Why didn't you tell the police?  ",6,2
MULDER: I don't know how well you recall the last 30 seconds but your life is in my hands regardless of whether or not you hold that gun.  ,6,2
MULDER: Just tell me everything you know. That may be the only way I can help you.  ,6,2
MULDER: Shut up. I'm guessing we got two or three miles before the roadblock.  ,6,2
MULDER: Check your window.  ,6,2

"MULDER: ""Mister."" I got you.  ",6,2
"MULDER: I can think of something else I'd like to call you. I could put ""mister"" in front of that, too if you'd like.  ",6,2
MULDER: (disbelieving) Excuse me?  ,6,2
"MULDER: (mad) It's Mr. Mulder to you, you peanut-picking bastard. Now, Mr. Crump what can you tell me about what's happening to you?  ",6,2
MULDER: What?  ,6,2
MULDER: What do you mean?  ,6,2
MULDER: I can't... I can't go... I can't go left. There's only trees there. Crump.  ,6,2
"MULDER: Crump... It's west. Huh, west? You got to head west. It's just like you did with your wife. You took her and you headed west. It's not just motion; it has to be in one direction. Is that right? What the hell happened to you?  ",6,2
MULDER: One more time. You woke up this morning then what?  ,6,2
MULDER: You woke up this morning but you didn't go to work. Why?  ,6,2
MULDER: What was your wife doing?  ,6,2
MULDER: You looked up.  ,6,2
MULDER: What caused it?  ,6,2
MULDER: I'm sorry about your wife.  ,6,2
MULDER: Crump...  ,6,2
MULDER: You think the government did this to you?  ,6,2
"MULDER: Well, on behalf of the international Jewish conspiracy I just need to inform you that we're... almost out of gas.  ",6,2
"MULDER: Okay, Crump, we got about one more mile. I'll make it fast. You ready? Here goes nothing.  ",6,2
"MULDER: Hey, turn on the pump! Number four! Three! Number three! Turn it on!  ",6,2
MULDER: I'm doing 70.  ,6,2
MULDER: Okay.  ,6,2
"MULDER: (sarcastic) That was an apology, right? Gee, I don't know if I can see to drive my eyes are tearing up so bad.  ",6,2
MULDER: Why am I doing what?  ,6,2
MULDER: It's not in your best interest to make me question that right now.  ,6,2
MULDER: I guess you don't.  ,6,2
"MULDER: Hey, you got to stay alive if you want to stick it to the government. If you die, you let them off the hook. Am I right? Huh?  ",6,2
MULDER: We'll figure this out.  ,6,2
MULDER: Crump?  ,6,2
MULDER: Mr. Crump...  ,6,2
"MULDER: (on phone) Yeah, aside from terminal cell phone withdrawal... That, and I got to pee. Where are you?  ",6,2
MULDER: (on phone) Headed where?  ,6,2
"MULDER: (on phone) I'm guessing wherever the hell route 36 ends but we can't stop, Scully. I'm kind of at a loss as to what to do next.  ",6,2
"MULDER: (on phone) Well, lay it on me.  ",6,2
"MULDER: (on phone) Yeah. It uses an antenna, like, 50 miles long. The military uses it to communicate with the trident submarines, Project Seafarer, Project Haarp.  ",6,2
"MULDER: (on phone) Not to mention that as a potential weapons application it's been referred to as ""electrical nerve gas"" or may be behind the so-called ""Taos Hum.""  ",6,2
MULDER: (on phone) But with constant movement somehow ameliorating that pressure making it bearable. But why only westward movement?  ,6,2
"MULDER: (on phone) The big question, Scully, is what do we do about it?  ",6,2
MULDER: (on phone) We'll be there.  ,6,2
"MULDER: Well, whether they did this to you intentionally or not, you were right. They did it to you.  ",6,2
"MULDER: Your one chance is that we meet my partner at the end of the highway. There, she will insert a long, large-bore needle into your inner ear hopefully relieving the pressure. Now, when we get there she's going to have to work fast. She's only going to have one chance. She's not going to be able to use any anesthetic and it will probably leave you deaf.  ",6,2
MULDER: Sure.  ,6,2
MULDER: Why don't you bill me?  ,6,2
MULDER: Okay. So are we done here? Back to the bozo work investigating huge piles of manure?  ,6,2
MULDER: (weakly) Hey   ,6,3
MULDER: My name's not Jerry.  ,6,3
MULDER: My name's Mulder. Fox Mulder.  ,6,3
MULDER: I got ID in my pocket.  ,6,3
MULDER: (surprised) Never heard of it?  ,6,3
MULDER: You never heard of the FBI?  ,6,3
MULDER: Where are you taking me?  ,6,3
MULDER: What are you talking about?  ,6,3
"MULDER: (confused) ""Deutschland Uber Alles""? Wait a second.  ",6,3
MULDER: What?  ,6,3
MULDER: I think there's been a mistake. I think the mistake is mine.  ,6,3
"MULDER: This is the Queen Anne, isn't it?  ",6,3
"MULDER: Hey, just about enough of that. I came looking for this ship.  ",6,3
MULDER: Hold on a second. I think I can explain what's going on.  ,6,3
MULDER: What's our current position?  ,6,3
MULDER: I'll tell you. I'll tell you. We're two degrees above the 30th parallel. Sargasso Sea. Just above the Tropic of Cancer. 64 degrees West by Southwest. Off the Plantagenet bank 60 miles South-southwest off Bermuda. How would I know that if I'd been in the water?  ,6,3
"MULDER: Tell me I'm wrong. Tell me that you haven't been able to get accurate compass readings. That navigation's been a real bitch. It's because you've been caught in something called ""The Devil's Triangle."" I can show you on the chart here. (crosses to wall chart) It goes from Bermuda down to Puerto Rico and back up to Florida. The Queen Anne is stuck here on the Eastern edge of it. You've been caught in some kind of time warp. In some kind of limbo dimension and now you've popped out the other side into 1998.  ",6,3
"MULDER: (laughing) You can relax. There's no war going on. The world is at peace. There's a little trouble over at our White House but that'll blow over, so to speak.  ",6,3
"MULDER: (showing them the date on his watch like they would believe him) No, no. It's not September 3rd. It's November 16th. Look.  ",6,3
MULDER: It's okay. The war's over. Let them take you to Germany. They make nice cars.  ,6,3
"MULDER: (to himself, grinning, thrilled) This is unbelievable.  ",6,3
"MULDER: (into radio) Mayday, mayday. This is Special Agent Fox Mulder with the FBI. I'm on the SS Queen Anne. (tries another channel) Ship in distress. Mayday, mayday.  ",6,3
"MULDER: Oh, sh.  ",6,3
MULDER: What the hell is going on? Spender?  ,6,3
MULDER doesn't answer or turn around. The NAZI SOLDIERS are no longer friendly.)  ,6,3
MULDER: (quietly to himself looking up at the pretty blonde singer) Hi.  ,6,3
MULDER: Scully?  ,6,3
"MULDER: (lifting the bill of his cap so she can see him) Scully, it's me, Mulder.  ",6,3
"MULDER: (offended, not understanding why she doesn't recognize him) I'm not a Nazi.  ",6,3
MULDER: I had to steal this uniform. (putting his hands on her back) Scully?  ,6,3
"MULDER: (to 1939 SCULLY) You see, I told you.  ",6,3
MULDER: You're all big men now but wait until you get into Russia. Hope you fellas like the cold.  ,6,3
"MULDER: Same to you, Adolf!  ",6,3
MULDER: You...  ,6,3
MULDER: No sprechen.  ,6,3
MULDER: I don't speak Nazi.  ,6,3
MULDER: (slight panic) Wait a minute. Why are you shooting me? Why are you killing me? What have I done? I don't understand what you're asking me.  ,6,3
"MULDER: (off screen) Skinner? Where are they taking me? Help me, Skinner!  ",6,3
"MULDER: I got two words for you, buddy-- Pearl Harbor.  ",6,3
"MULDER: After Poland, Hitler's on his way to Denmark, Holland and France with a few stops in between. The French all but roll over on us, the Italians seize their opportunity and the Japanese come through the back door. It's a long, bloody story. It fortunately has a happy ending.  ",6,3
"MULDER: Yeah, you come out on the side of history with no small amount of help from us. Not much to apologize over the next 50 years except for maybe the Spice Girls.  ",6,3
MULDER: You speak German. What was that shouting about up there?  ,6,3
MULDER: Are we?  ,6,3
MULDER: But the Captain knew something. He wouldn't give up the wheel.  ,6,3
"MULDER: Hey, this ship can't go to Germany.  ",6,3
MULDER: I got news for you-- you're not carrying munitions. It's something far more deadly.  ,6,3
"MULDER: Thor's Hammer isn't a weapon. It's a man, a man who will help build a weapon-- a bomb that'll win the war for whoever has it.  ",6,3
MULDER: I saw him in the ballroom.  ,6,3
MULDER: Listen to me! Listen to me! You can't take this ship to England. You'll never make it.  ,6,3
"MULDER: You can't take the ship to Jamaica, either. The Germans will hunt you down no matter what course you steer.  ",6,3
MULDER: My name's Mulder.  ,6,3
"MULDER: No, I want you to take this ship and turn it back around the way you came.  ",6,3
MULDER: You've got to turn the ship around.  ,6,3
MULDER: The future.  ,6,3
"MULDER: Actually, the past.  ",6,3
"MULDER: Well, I can explain it to you.  ",6,3
"MULDER: (to the SAILORS and CREWMEN) Turn the ship around or Hitler rises, Germany wins and your children will never know what freedom is!  ",6,3
MULDER: (quietly) I don't know.  ,6,3
MULDER: (quietly) I don't know.  ,6,3
MULDER: None.  ,6,3
MULDER: I'll answer the question.  ,6,3
MULDER: That man is the scientist.  ,6,3
"MULDER: (pointing down) I told you, this man is the scientist.  ",6,3
"MULDER: John Brown. Ask me again, and I'll knock you down.  ",6,3
MULDER: Puddintame. Ask me again and I'll tell you the same.  ,6,3
MULDER: (whispering sarcastically to 1939 SCULLY) That's great.  ,6,3
MULDER: What'd he say?  ,6,3
MULDER: Uh...I think I know what he said.  ,6,3
MULDER: The engines shut down.  ,6,3
MULDER: Hey!  ,6,3
MULDER: Come with me.  ,6,3
MULDER: 'Cause you're the only one who can save this ship. Come on.  ,6,3
MULDER: (taking her hand) Come on.  ,6,3
MULDER: Come on... Come on!  ,6,3
MULDER: I'm going to tell you how to save this ship.  ,6,3
MULDER: I can't stay. I got to get back to history.  ,6,3
MULDER: (holding her arms) And you got to rescue it. Wait. Listen to me. This ship's been caught in something called the devil's triangle. It's some kind of time warp-- a rift in space.  ,6,3
"MULDER: You know Einstein, right? He predicts the theoretical possibility. He also predicts an atomic weapon that will destroy the world.  ",6,3
MULDER: If you don't go back and convince the crew of this ship to turn this ship around and head back into the devil's triangle everything Einstein predicted will become true-- except for the outcome of history.  ,6,3
"MULDER: In all likelihood, I won't exist.  ",6,3
MULDER: And neither will you.  ,6,3
"MULDER: So, in case we never meet again...  ",6,3
MULDER: I was expecting a left.  ,6,3
MULDER: (waking) Where am I? (tries to sit up)  ,6,3
MULDER: Ooooo.  ,6,3
MULDER: I feel... Like hell.  ,6,3
MULDER: What happened to me?  ,6,3
MULDER: What did I do?  ,6,3
MULDER: Say that again?  ,6,3
MULDER: You were there.  ,6,3
"MULDER: You were there, Scully.  ",6,3
"MULDER: (referring to SKINNER) And he was there, too.  ",6,3
"MULDER: No, you were there with the Nazis.  ",6,3
"MULDER: You saved the world, Scully.  ",6,3
"MULDER: No, no, no.... The Queen Anne-- I found it. You were there with Thor's Hammer. I told you you had to turn the ship around and then I jumped overboard.  ",6,3
"MULDER: No, no, no. You and I were on that ship, Scully. In 1939.  ",6,3
MULDER: I would've never seen you again. But you believed me.  ,6,3
MULDER: Mmm. ( chuckles )  ,6,3
"MULDER: Hey, Scully. (leans up on his elbow)  ",6,3
MULDER: I love you.  ,6,3
MULDER:   (pointing at a sign)   Milepost 134.  Two miles to go.  ,6,4
MULDER:    Because of where this particular crackpot works.  Groom Lake. Area 51.  Where the military has conducted...  ,6,4
MULDER:    It's all our questions.  The proof that we've suspected but never been able to hold in our hands.  That... that proof is here.  ,6,4
MULDER:    What is your point?  ,6,4
MULDER:    (defensive)  This *is* a normal life.  ,6,4
MULDER:    I don't know if we're going to meet that crackpot after all.  ,6,4
MULDER:    Why? It's a public highway.  ,6,4
MULDER:    What are you doing out here?  ,6,4
"MULDER (as MORRIS) is David Duchovny playing Mulder.  We see him as he really is - Mulder, but everyone else sees Morris. MORRIS (as MULDER) is Michael McKean playing Morris but is perceived as Mulder.  ",6,4

MULDER (as MORRIS):    No! No. Let them go.  Let them go.  ,6,4

"MULDER (as MORRIS):   (not happy to be here)  There it is, huh?  Home sweet home.  ",6,4
MULDER (as MORRIS):   (getting out of the car)   All right.  ,6,4
MULDER (as MORRIS):    Ciao.  ,6,4

MULDER (as MORRIS):   (on phone)    No. Thank you.  Good night.  ,6,4
"MULDER:    Oh, if I had the name, I'd give it to you.  (SCULLY looks at him sharply)  Some whistle-blower working inside the so-called Area 51.  Said he had some ""big deal"" information.  I got to tell you... The whole thing turned out to be just one gigantic mistake on our part.  ",6,4
"MULDER:    Sir, you're absolutely right.  And on behalf of Agent Scully and myself, I'd like to apologize for our blatant disregard of your direct order. You have our word.  We will never ever do that again.  ",6,4

"MULDER (as MORRIS):    Well, yeah, but I mean, how do we reverse it?  How do we get the lizard out of the rock?  ",6,4
MULDER (as MORRIS):    What?  ,6,4
MULDER (as MORRIS):    No.  No. It's not... It's not that you're disgusting. I-i-it's just that...  ,6,4
MULDER (as MORRIS):    Does Scully sound like a woman's name to you?  ,6,4
"MULDER (as MORRIS):    Oh, Joanne, I'm sure I've told you many times in the past that there are things about my work that unfortunately, I have to keep a secret.  ",6,4
"MULDER (as MORRIS):     My point is that there are a lot of things you don't know about me.  And... I've just... I've been under a lot of pressure lately. I mean, up is down and black is white.  I don't know where I stand anymore.  I don't even know... who I am really anymore.  I just... I know for sure that I am not the man you married.  I'm just not.  And I'm sorry.  I'm truly sorry.

MULDER (as MORRIS):    I think that that was the doorbell.  ,6,4
"MULDER (as MORRIS):    (quietly)   Scully, it's me.  It's Mulder.  ",6,4
"MULDER (as MORRIS):    I'm Mulder.  I'm really Mulder.  I switched bodies, places, identities with this man Morris Fletcher the man that you think is Mulder, but he's not.  (sees his reflection in the car window - of MORRIS)  Of course you don't believe me.  Why was I expecting anything different?  Your full name is Dana Katherine Scully.  Your badge number is... Hell! I don't know your badge number.  Your mother's name is Margaret.  Your brother's name is Bill Jr.  He's in the Navy and he hates me.  (no response from SCULLY) Lately, for lunch, you've been having this six-ounce cup of yogurt, plain yogurt, into which you stir bee pollen because you're on a bee pollen kick even though I tell you you're a scientist and you should know better.

"MULDER (as MORRIS):    Even that yogurt thing?  That is so you. That is so Scully.  Well, it's good to know you haven't changed.  That's somewhat comforting.  ",6,4
MULDER (as MORRIS):    I'll prove it to you.  ,6,4
MULDER (as MORRIS):    Scientific proof about what happened to us on that road two nights ago.  Fair enough?  ,6,4

"MULDER (as MORRIS):    Scully, I got it.  I got the proof.  ",6,4
MULDER (as MORRIS):   (betrayed)   Scully? You?  ,6,4
"MULDER (as MORRIS):   (to MORRIS) You!  You son of a bitch!  You orchestrated this whole thing! He's not me, Scully!  Would I do this?!  Would I do this?! Scully...!  Scully!  ",6,4

MULDER AS MORRIS: (confused)  Meaning?  ,6,5
"MULDER AS MORRIS: (faking it)   I didn't know if I could trust you.  We have a security leak, gentlemen and for all I knew it was one of you.  That's why I decided I should approach Agent Scully alone to find out who her contact is.  Unfortunately, her partner Agent (said with disgust) Mulder screwed everything up.  ",6,5
MULDER AS MORRIS: I knew that you wouldn't believe it until you figured it out for yourself.  ,6,5
"MULDER AS MORRIS: Oh, yeah. Absolutely.  ",6,5
MULDER AS MORRIS:   (laughing)   Of course.  ,6,5
"MULDER AS MORRIS: (trying to be friendly)  Hey, Chris.  Hey, I like the, uh... The, uh... The nose... (he touches the ring and she jerks back)  ",6,5

MULDER AS MORRIS: Joanne...  ,6,5

MULDER AS MORRIS: Dana Scully- Special Agent Dana Scully.  ,6,5
"MULDER AS MORRIS: She's my partner, Joanne.  ",6,5
"MULDER AS MORRIS: My name is not Morris Fletcher.  It's Fox Mulder. Special Agent Fox Mulder with the FBI.  Dana Scully is my FBI partner.  I am not your husband we are not married, we are complete strangers and I have a whole other life that I'm desperately trying to get back to.  ",6,5
"MULDER AS MORRIS: I want you to look out the window.  Will you just look out the window with me for a second?  See that car down there?  See the two men in it?  They're surveilling me. They're spying on me.  I don't know if your husband ever told you this but he has a very dangerous job and those two men in that car, like you, think that I'm him only they don't trust me.  So, one false move and I'm history.  Which means that your husband will also be history because I won't be able to get back and set things the way they're supposed to be.  Do you understand what I'm saying to you?  ",6,5
MULDER AS MORRIS AS MULDER: Maybe I like to read the New York Times backwards.  ,6,5
MULDER AS MORRIS: Where can we go?  ,6,5
MULDER AS MORRIS: You're right. We should get out of the house.  Go someplace with a lot of people.  ,6,5
MULDER AS MORRIS: Mm-hmm.  ,6,5
MULDER AS MORRIS: (smiling and stroking her face)   What do you say?  ,6,5
"MULDER AS MORRIS: No, I'm not expecting someone.  ",6,5
"MULDER AS MORRIS: Joanne, have another white wine.  ",6,5
"MULDER AS MORRIS: Whoa, ooh, that beer, it went right through me.  I got to... I'll be right back.  ",6,5

MULDER AS MORRIS:  (getting in the car with her)  What are you doing here?  ,6,5
MULDER AS MORRIS: I guess I make a lousy husband.  ,6,5
"MULDER AS MORRIS: Yeah, I do.  ",6,5
MULDER AS MORRIS: So what?  ,6,5
MULDER AS MORRIS: You take that to Scully right now.  ,6,5
MULDER AS MORRIS: His buddy?  He doesn't trust me as far as he can throw me.  You saw to that.  ,6,5

"MULDER AS MORRIS: Hey, guys.  ",6,5
"MULDER AS MORRIS: It's, uh... Beer.  ",6,5
"MULDER AS MORRIS: No, it's beer.  ",6,5
MULDER AS MORRIS: Morris Fletcher.  ,6,5
MULDER AS MORRIS: I'm hoping this'll be our last meeting.   Agent Scully's flying back with the analysis of that flight data recorder.  ,6,5
MULDER AS MORRIS: I know.  The real Morris Fletcher knows you're the leak.  ,6,5
MULDER AS MORRIS: Why'd you do it?  ,6,5
"MULDER AS MORRIS: Well, why?  ",6,5
MULDER AS MORRIS: What is the truth?  ,6,5
MULDER AS MORRIS: Don't know what?  ,6,5
"MULDER AS MORRIS: Well, if you don't know, why'd you call me?  ",6,5
MULDER AS MORRIS: You don't look too happy.  Don't tell me I'm going to have to put two kids through school.  ,6,5
MULDER AS MORRIS: And how do I get back?  ,6,5
MULDER AS MORRIS: I might wind up with my head in a rock.  ,6,5
"MULDER AS MORRIS: (depressed)   What about him?  I mean, me. Whatever. Whoever he is.  ",6,5
"MULDER AS MORRIS: What do you mean, ""just tagging along""?  ",6,5
MULDER AS MORRIS: No. You can explain it to them like you explained it to me.  You have the data.  You can make them understand.  You can get your job back.  ,6,5
MULDER AS MORRIS: (through clenched teeth) If I... shoot him is that murder or suicide?  ,6,5
"MULDER AS MORRIS: Hey, Scully...  ",6,5
MULDER AS MORRIS:   What are you doing here?  ,6,5
"MULDER AS MORRIS: Joanne, I told you-- I'm not your husband.  (points to MORRIS)  This man is.  ",6,5
"MULDER AS MORRIS: Come on, Morris.  Let's go.  ",6,5
"MULDER AS MORRIS: We got to get back to that highway, back to the exact spot where this all began.  It may be our only chance.  ",6,5
MULDER AS MORRIS: This isn't what it looks like.  ,6,5
MULDER AS MORRIS: The warp that  started this is snapping back like a rubber band.  ,6,5
MULDER: (to HOWARD)  Why are you doing this?  ,6,5
MULDER AS MORRIS: It'll be like the last few days never happened.  You won't remember any of this.  ,6,5
MULDER:   (on phone)   Mulder.  ,6,5
"MULDER:   (on phone)   Oh, yeah?  ",6,5
"MULDER:   (on phone)   Well, I guess you were right, Scully.  Just another crackpot who watches too much Star Trek.  ",6,5
"MULDER:   (on phone)   Hey, Scully?  I, uh, know it's not your normal life, but...  Thanks for coming out there with me.  ",6,5
"MULDER:    Oh, Mulder. Fox Mulder.  Though I ask you not to make that known to anybody.  The FBI likes to keep our work on these cases very hush-hush.  ",6,6
"MULDER:   Oh.  No, no, no. I'll thank him for you because I have to call in my, uh, progress report.  ",6,6
"MULDER:    Oh, me, too.  All right.  ",6,6
"MULDER:    Not many.  Certainly not in the way yours did,  Mrs. Weinsider.  ",6,6
"MULDER:    You mentioned a fire in the room, in your account and a, uh... a devil that held your legs...  ",6,6
MULDER:    But according to your statement  your baby... was not a normal baby.  ,6,6
MULDER:    Um... You were right there in bed with your wife the whole time Mr. Weinsider?  ,6,6
"MULDER:    But according to... your wife's statement, at one point she... she reached over for you in the bed and you weren't there.  ",6,6
MULDER:    (suspicious)  Yeah.  Mind if I use your phone... Wayne?  ,6,6
"MULDER:  (on phone)    Hey, Scully, it's me.  ",6,6
"MULDER:  (on phone)    I, uh... Before I tell you  I-I'm going to ask you to keep an open mind.  ",6,6
MULDER:  (on phone)    Call it what you like. Here in Roanoke they're calling it a demon baby snatching.  ,6,6
"MULDER:  (on phone)    Look,  I want you to look at this woman's charts. Strange in utero deformities were detected. I'm going to courier them to you, all right?  ",6,6
"MULDER:  (on phone)    Scully, Spender just round filed this case-- it's unconscionable.  ",6,6
MULDER:  (on phone)    Like that's any different from the assignment we're stuck with.  ,6,6
"MULDER:  (on phone)    Scully, this is a classic case of demon fetal harvest- what they called in the middle ages atum nocturnem-- the impregnation of an unwitting woman by a dark lord of the underworld...  ",6,6
MULDER:  (on phone)    Exactly.  ,6,6
"MULDER:  (on phone)    Yeah, but this is the real deal.   You check that woman's charts, you'll get hard evidence.   Check her prenatal ultrasound.  ",6,6
"MULDER:  (on phone)    Just humor me, Scully. Take a look at those medical records.  I think they'll prove my theory.  ",6,6
MULDER:  (on phone)    Mulder.  ,6,6
MULDER:  (on phone)    What'd you find?  ,6,6
MULDER:  (on phone)    Describe them to me.  ,6,6
"MULDER:  (on phone)    ""Protuberances?""   You mean, like horns?  ",6,6
MULDER:  (on phone)    Do you think this is something that could be passed along by the father?  ,6,6
MULDER:  (on phone)    What are you talking about?  ,6,6
"MULDER:  (on phone)    ""Mandrake?""  ",6,6
MULDER:  (on phone)    You think Mrs. Weinsider self-prescribed?  ,6,6
MULDER:  (on phone)    Yeah? What? Yes?  ,6,6
"MULDER:  (on phone)    All right, thank you.  ",6,6
MULDER:    Mandrake.  ,6,6
"MULDER:    Hey, why don't you just let your sister talk?   It might clear things up.  ",6,6
MULDER:    She's not under arrest.  ,6,6
MULDER:    Wayne-- Mr. Weinsider-I-I don't want to arrest Laura.  I'm sure you'd hate like the devil for that to happen as well.  ,6,6
MULDER:    So why don't you tell Deputy Stevens that it's okay to search the premises so we can clear up any misunderstanding about who's responsible for what happened here?  ,6,6
MULDER:    Whatever else we find I know everybody in this house is regular.  ,6,6
MULDER:    I know what you are.  ,6,6
"MULDER:    Hey, Wayne.  Where you going?  ",6,6
MULDER:    You seem like you're in an awful big hurry.  ,6,6
MULDER:    Really? An appointment?  Appointment with who?  ,6,6
"MULDER:    Right, you're in the insurance business.  That must take you out on the road an awful lot, huh?  ",6,6
MULDER:    So where is our appointment?  How far do we have to go?  ,6,6
"MULDER:    Come on, Wayne, I'll race you.  ",6,6
"MULDER:    Okay, speed racers.  That's enough driver's education for today.  ",6,6
MULDER:  (on phone)    Yeah.  ,6,6
MULDER:  (on phone)    What?  ,6,6
MULDER:  (on phone)    Tell him I'm down here doing a background check on somebody.  (hangs up)  ,6,6
MULDER:    I was down in the basement at county records doing a background check.  ,6,6
MULDER:    That's where I was. I was piecing together the history of the man that did this to her.  ,6,6
MULDER:    Perfect.  ,6,6
MULDER:    Not a shred of evidence is exactly the evidence I'd hoped you'd find.  Check this out.  ,6,6
"MULDER:    Wayne Weinsider. He's a Czech national, emigrated in 1994.  He's also known as Bud Hasselhoff, also known as Gordy Boitano.  ",6,6
MULDER:    There's  more. Read on.  ,6,6
MULDER:    I'm not suggesting anything.  I think the facts speak for themselves.  ,6,6
MULDER:    I don't know why; I'm not a psychologist but this is the best explanation for how that I've heard.  ,6,6
"MULDER:    You're going to find discrete osteopathic deformities to the upper vertebrae, two bony protrusions between the parietal and occipital lobes of the skull.  ",6,6
MULDER:    Put out an APB for your brother-in-law.  He's not going to come back here.  ,6,6
MULDER:    Just find him.  ,6,6
"MULDER:    He's done this to other women here, Scully just like in Czechoslovakia.  My guess is that baby we just dug up belonged to one of Wayne's other wives.  ",6,6
MULDER:    He's exercising his biological imperative and he'll do anything or say anything he has to to succeed.  ,6,6
MULDER:    Because they're demons and he wants a normal child.  ,6,6
MULDER:  (on phone)    15527 Leahy.  That's in Cave Spring.  It's West Roanoke.  Cave Spring. Thank you.  Thank you very much for your help.  ,6,6
"MULDER:    Scully, hold on.  ",6,6
MULDER:    Harmony Mutual Insurance has a second address for Wayne Weinsider all  the way across the other side of Roanoke County.  ,6,6
"MULDER:    Well, think about it, Scully.  He meets or screens prospective women through work. That's probably why he came to this country in the first place-- bigger gene pool more women-- then he plants as many seeds as he can. Let's just hope he hasn't been able to harvest many more of them.  ",6,6
MULDER:    Wayne!  It's over.  ,6,6
"MULDER:    Where's the baby, Wayne?  ",6,6
MULDER:    Put the shovel down.  Your lies won't work anymore.  ,6,6
MULDER:    Where's the baby?  ,6,6
MULDER:    You can't blame anyone else like you did with Laura.  ,6,6
"MULDER:   (pulling him back)  Hey, cut it out!  Come on.  You're in enough trouble as it is.  You don't want to complicate your situation further by endangering his life again, do you?  ",6,6
MULDER:    I think the why is directly related to the how.  ,6,6
MULDER:    We should just go talk to this other wife of his.  This woman Betsy. Come on.  ,6,6
MULDER:    (to SCULLY)   How many?  ,6,6
MULDER:    I know.  ,6,6
MULDER:    I don't think he did anything with it.  ,6,6
"MULDER:    These weren't Wayne's babies, Scully.  ",6,6
MULDER:    I think Wayne realized something last night.  That's why he was out here digging.  He realized that he'd met someone even more evil than he was-- who would sacrifice what he desperately wanted for himself.  ,6,6
MULDER:    It was no coincidence that she ran into us last night.  We were taken in by her just like Wayne was-- by a woman who would say anything or do anything to get what she wanted-- who was even more driven than he was.  ,6,6
MULDER:    To have what only Wayne could give her.  ,6,6
"MULDER:    Nice to meet you, sir.  ",6,7
"MULDER:    Come on, Scully.  You act like I intentionally misled you.  Over the past 30 years this town has had more tornadoes heat waves and hailstorms than any other town in the country.  It's like ground zero for extreme weather.  ",6,7
"MULDER:    Well, if that's true-- if Daryl Mootz is controlling the weather for profit-- then that is a crime and that should be investigated.  ",6,7
"MULDER:    Yeah, but how many scapegoats lease office space?  ",6,7
MULDER:    (holding out his badge)  Agents Mulder and Scully with the FBI. We're looking for Daryl Mootz.  ,6,7
MULDER:    We want to see the king.  ,6,7
"MULDER:    Well, when you say ""on business"" you mean he's making it rain?  ",6,7
"MULDER:    (still interested in the TV)   This, uh, TV station-- is that far from here?  ",6,7
MULDER:    (smiling at SCULLY)  It's like looking in a mirror.  ,6,7
"MULDER:    Well, from what I've read about Kroner you've had more than your fair share of unusual weather.  ",6,7
"MULDER:    No, no, um... What about the rain?  ",6,7
MULDER:    (holding the list they got from CINDY)   I have a list of over 40 names here-- people in four different counties-- who claim that Daryl Mootz has made it rain for them.  ,6,7
MULDER:    According to his schedule the King should have been here by now.  ,6,7
MULDER:    How do you explain your unique ability?  ,6,7
MULDER:    Try me.  I watch the Weather Channel.  ,6,7
"MULDER:    Well, this is not without historical precedent.  The Old West was full of traveling men who claimed to be rainmakers.  The Pueblo Indians even had a rain dance.  ",6,7
"MULDER:    Scully, I don't think it's a coincidence that a cow gets hurled at me just as we're down here investigating the weather.  ",6,7
"MULDER:    I'm telling you, that cow had my name on it.  ",6,7
MULDER:    Are you saying that you're somehow responsible for the...  ,6,7
MULDER:    What's your connection to Daryl Mootz?  ,6,7
"MULDER:    And ever since then, the rain's been following him.  ",6,7
MULDER:    No.  I can tell you without a doubt that you're not responsible for any of that weather.  ,6,7
MULDER:    Agent Scully and I specialize in these types of cases and-and-and although you may have had some bad luck you didn't cause any of it.  ,6,7
"MULDER:    Yeah, yeah, I'm... I'm sure.  Scully, you have any doubts?  ",6,7
MULDER:    You see?  ,6,7
MULDER:    You're welcome.  ,6,7
MULDER:    What are you talking about?  ,6,7
"MULDER:    Look at this, Scully  (holds up newspaper)   September 20, 1991, it rained rose petals for nearly an hour.  ",6,7
"MULDER:    She's not. Neither is Daryl.  Check this out-- on the same day that it rained rose petals.  ""Irene Hardt, beloved wife and devoted mother passed away yesterday afternoon... She's survived by one son, Holman Hardt.""  ",6,7
"MULDER:    Holman Hardt is manufacturing the weather.  Did you see how relieved he was when he learned that Daryl was drunk?  I've been doing some checking. Holman Hardt has been hospitalized five times with nervous exhaustion, each time coinciding with a major meteorological event.  ",6,7
"MULDER:    Most people will admit that the weather plays a significant role in the way they feel, right?  There's even that disorder.  ",6,7
"MULDER:    Mm-hmm, yeah.  Well, who's to say that it doesn't work the other way around-- that the way someone feels can affect the weather... that the weather is somehow an expression of Holman Hardt's feelings or-or-or better still, the feelings that he's not expressing?  ",6,7
"MULDER:    Hey, Holman.  ",6,7
"MULDER:    I've come to say good-bye, Holman.  ",6,7
MULDER:    Yeah.  But I want you to get some help before you kill somebody.  ,6,7
"MULDER:    You know what I'm talking about.  You're not just a weatherman, you're the weatherman.  You're the person who's been affecting the weather.  ",6,7
"MULDER:    I don't think it works that way.  I don't think you don't do it on purpose.  I just think you bottle up your emotions-- anger, grief, or love or whatever-- and then, as a response, it rains or hails or there's a flying cow.  ",6,7
"MULDER:    And whatever it is, you got to let it out.  ",6,7
"MULDER:    Yeah, you can.  (sits beside him)  It's Sheila, isn't it?  You love her.  You've always loved her.  That, uh, tornado at the high school... that was you, wasn't it?  ",6,7
MULDER:    And you've never told her the way you feel?  ,6,7
"MULDER:    Well, you better tell her or you're going to kill somebody. (crosses to the door)  ",6,7
MULDER:    I got a plane to catch.  ,6,7
MULDER:    I am meeting my partner at the airport.  ,6,7
MULDER:    Excuse me. Hold on.  (into phone)  Mulder.  ,6,7
MULDER:   (on phone)   I'm on my way.  ,6,7
MULDER:   (on phone)   Fog?  (looks accusingly at HOLMAN)  Holman!  ,6,7
MULDER:   (on phone)   Yeah... he wants advice.  Dating advice.  ,6,7
"MULDER:   (on phone)   Yours truly.  (VERRRRY LOOOONG pause)  Hello?  Hey, Scully.  Scully, you there?  ",6,7
"MULDER:   (on phone, one word at a time)   I will talk to you later.  ",6,7
"MULDER:    This is about you, Holman.  I'm here to help you.  I'm perfectly happy with my friendship with Agent Scully.  ",6,7
MULDER:    (straightens HOLMAN's tie)  Just tell her how you feel.  ,6,7
MULDER:    And Holman.  I do not gaze at Scully.  ,6,7
MULDER:    Well?  ,6,7
"MULDER:    (grinning at HOLMAN)   Oh, you did it.  ",6,7
MULDER:    What are you talking about?  ,6,7
"MULDER:    (entering)   Hey!  Hey, Daryl.  Cut it out, man.  ",6,7
MULDER:    Daryl.  ,6,7
"MULDER:    (looking through a window at a weather monitor)  Scully, do you know anything about, um... weather radar?  ",6,7
MULDER:    What does red mean?  ,6,7
MULDER:    Looks like we're not going to be able to catch our plane.  ,6,7
"MULDER:    If she's here, he'll be here.  ",6,7
"MULDER:    Come on, Holman, now make it stop.  ",6,7
MULDER:    My fault?  ,6,7
"MULDER:    Yes, he was.  ",6,7
"MULDER:    (desperate)   Tell her, Holman.  ",6,7
"MULDER:    I'll build the ark, you gather the animals.  ",6,7
MULDER:    (calling after her)   I was kidding.  ,6,7
MULDER:    Where's your leg?  ,6,7
MULDER:    You might want to take a look at the king-- make sure he's all right.  Whatever happened to Sheila?  ,6,7
MULDER:    I didn't know reunions could be so...  ,6,7
"MULDER:    Well, how'd it go?  ",6,7
MULDER:    (happy to see her)  I almost gave up on you.  ,6,8
MULDER:    Stakeout.  ,6,8
MULDER:    It's an important date.  ,6,8
MULDER:    Important to why we're here.  Why don't you turn off your car and I'll fill you in on the details.  ,6,8
MULDER:    Oh.  ,6,8
"MULDER:    Look, if you've got Christmas stuff to do I don't want to... you know...  ",6,8
MULDER:    I just thought you'd be more... curious.  ,6,8
MULDER:    No one.  ,6,8
MULDER:    The former occupants.  ,6,8
MULDER:    That's the story.  ,6,8
MULDER:    No. Actually that was a left cheek sneak.  ,6,8
MULDER:    Technically speaking they're called apparitions.  ,6,8
MULDER:    I'll make it fast.  I'll just give you the details.  ,6,8
"MULDER:    (mysteriously)   Christmas, 1917.  It was a time of dark, dark despair.  American soldiers were dying at an ungodly rate in a war-torn Europe while at home, a deadly strain of the flu virus attacked young and old alike. Tragedy was a visitor on every doorstep while a creeping hopelessness set in with every man, woman and child. It was a time of dark, dark despair.  ",6,8
MULDER:    But here at 1501 Larkspur Lane for a pair of star-crossed lovers tragedy came not from war or pestilence-- not by the boot heel or the bombardier-- but by their own innocent hand.  ,6,8
"MULDER:    His name was Maurice.  He was a... a brooding but heroic young man beloved of Lyda, a sublime beauty with a light that seemed to follow her wherever she went.  They were likened to two angels descended from heaven whom the gods could not protect from the horrors being visited upon this cold, grey earth.  ",6,8
MULDER:    Driven by a tragic fear of separation they forged a lovers' pact so that they might spend eternity together and not spend one precious Christmas apart.  ,6,8
MULDER:    And their ghosts haunt this house every Christmas Eve.  ,6,8
MULDER:    I just gave myself chills.  ,6,8
MULDER:    You don't believe in ghosts?  ,6,8
MULDER:    Well... Yeah.  I thought everybody believed in ghosts.  ,6,8
MULDER:    My best to the family.  ,6,8
MULDER:    I'm just going to take a look.  ,6,8
MULDER:    Change your mind?  ,6,8
MULDER:    No.  ,6,8
MULDER:    Why would I take your car keys?  ,6,8
MULDER:    Maybe it was a ghost.  ,6,8
MULDER:    That's a cold wind.  ,6,8
MULDER:    I think the spirits are among us.  ,6,8
MULDER:    Sounds like there's somebody walking around upstairs.  ,6,8
MULDER:    There. You hear that?  ,6,8
MULDER:    There's nothing to be afraid of.  ,6,8
MULDER:    Ghosts are benevolent entities.  ,6,8
MULDER:    Mostly.  ,6,8
MULDER:    Shh!  What was that?  ,6,8
MULDER:    (trying another locked door)  Mm-hmm.  ,6,8
MULDER:    Tell me you're not afraid.  ,6,8
MULDER:    (not moving)   I got your back.  ,6,8
MULDER:    No one lives here.  ,6,8
MULDER:    Must have been some kind of electrical surge.  ,6,8
MULDER:    Is it?  ,6,8
MULDER:    Yeah.  ,6,8
MULDER:    Why would anyone want to live in a cursed house?  ,6,8
MULDER:    Every couple that's ever lived here has met a tragic end. Three double murders in the last 80 years.  All on Christmas Eve.  ,6,8
MULDER:    Whoa... There's that sound again  ,6,8
MULDER:    (chuckling)  I think there's a hiding space under the floorboards.  ,6,8
MULDER:    There may be somebody trapped under there.  ,6,8
MULDER:    I got to get them out.  ,6,8
"MULDER:    Hey, you have a gun, right?  Rationally, you've been in much more dangerous situations.  ",6,8
MULDER:    I was half right.  ,6,8
"MULDER:    Hey, Scully...  Look at this.  ",6,8
MULDER:    Yeah.  ,6,8
MULDER:    What?  ,6,8
MULDER:    How embarrassing.  ,6,8
MULDER:    Oh... Scully...  ,6,8
"MULDER:    (realizing)  Hey, Scully...  ",6,8
MULDER:    All right.  I'm beginning to... Get this.  ,6,8
MULDER:    I should come out... This door.  ,6,8
MULDER:    Scully!  ,6,8
MULDER:    Scully!  ,6,8
"MULDER:    Hey, Scully.   Scully, can you hear me?  ",6,8
MULDER:    Hey!  Who are you?  ,6,8
MULDER:    No.  ,6,8
MULDER:    That's very funny.  ,6,8
MULDER:    Have you looked at the door?  ,6,8
MULDER:    Tell me what you see.  ,6,8
MULDER:    That's a door with a brick wall behind it.  ,6,8
MULDER:    You're playing tricks on me.  ,6,8
"MULDER:    Yeah? That's a trick in itself, isn't it?  You've been playing tricks on us since we got here.  ",6,8
"MULDER:    Ah, that's very funny coming from a ghost.  ",6,8
MULDER:    Strange folks?  ,6,8
MULDER:    Like those folks under the floorboard  ,6,8
MULDER:    How did you do that?  ,6,8
MULDER:    There were corpses here-- bodies buried under the floorboards.  ,6,8
MULDER:    No.  ,6,8
MULDER:    No.  ,6,8
MULDER:    Wow.  I didn't know such a thing existed.  ,6,8
MULDER:    And what category is that?  ,6,8
MULDER:    That's a category?  ,6,8
MULDER:    I don't think that pegs me exactly.  ,6,8
MULDER:    Because I have seen them?  ,6,8
"MULDER:    ""Paramasturbatory""?  ",6,8
"MULDER:    All right, now just, uh... Just back off for a second.  ",6,8
MULDER:    (confident)   I'm not alone.  ,6,8
"MULDER:    No, I came here with my partner. She's somewhere in the house.  ",6,8
MULDER:    I'd just like to find my partner.  ,6,8
"MULDER:    Who are you, now?  ",6,8
MULDER:    I'm trying to get out of this room.  ,6,8
MULDER:    Excuse me.  ,6,8
MULDER:    Frump.  ,6,8
MULDER:    You're a ghost.  ,6,8
MULDER:    What happened to the star-crossed lovers?  ,6,8
"MULDER:    (realizing)   It's you.  You're Lyda, and that was Maurice. But you've aged.  ",6,8
MULDER:    To all what?  ,6,8
MULDER:    We came here looking for you.  ,6,8
MULDER: (chuckling)  No.  ,6,8
MULDER:    Why?  ,6,8
MULDER:    (crossing his arms over his chest)  What about her?  ,6,8
MULDER:    Yeah.  ,6,8
MULDER:    What experience?  ,6,8
MULDER:    I thought you had a lovers' pact.  ,6,8
MULDER:    (shocked)   Oh...!  ,6,8
MULDER:    (rather disgusted)   Why are you showing it to me?  ,6,8
"MULDER:    Oh, you're trying to tell me that Scully's going to shoot me. Scully is not going to shoot me.  ",6,8
MULDER:    I wouldn't shoot her.  ,6,8
MULDER:    (confidently)   I wouldn't let her.  ,6,8
MULDER:    (sighing with a smile)  We're not lovers.  ,6,8
"MULDER:    (outside door)   Hey, Scully!  ",6,8
MULDER:    (outside door)   Scully?!  ,6,8
"MULDER:    (outside door)   Scully... Scully, are you there?!  ",6,8
"MULDER:    (outside door)   Open the door, Scully!  ",6,8
MULDER:    Where's Scully?  ,6,8
"MULDER:    There's no getting out of here, Scully.  There's no way home. (fires)  ",6,8
MULDER:    You going to shoot me?!  ,6,8
MULDER:    (maniacal)   It's me or you... You or me. One of us has to do it.  ,6,8
"MULDER:    Oh, yes, we do.  ",6,8
MULDER:    Even if we could what's waiting for us?  More loneliness! And then 365 more shopping days till even more loneliness!  ,6,8
"MULDER:    Merry Christmas, Scully.  ",6,8
MULDER/LYDA:    Let me go!  ,6,8
MULDER/LYDA:    Let me go!  ,6,8
MULDER:    Scully!  ,6,8
MULDER:   Scully?  ,6,8
MULDER:    What did you do?  ,6,8
MULDER:    You didn't believe what?  ,6,8
MULDER:    (not pulling away)  What are you doing?  ,6,8
MULDER:    Scully?  ,6,8
MULDER:    (gasping)   Scully...  ,6,8
"MULDER:    (holding his gun on her)   No, you're not... Not without me, you're not.  ",6,8
"MULDER:    I am, too.  ",6,8
MULDER:    You should have thought of this.  ,6,8
MULDER:    (accusing)   You shot me first!  ,6,8
MULDER:    Scully...  ,6,8
MULDER:    Get up.  ,6,8
MULDER:    Get up... You're not shot.  ,6,8
MULDER:    Come on.  It's a trick.  It's all in your head.  ,6,8
MULDER:    Come in.   Aren't you supposed to be opening Christmas gifts with your family?  ,6,8
MULDER:    (unsure of what to say)   I-it must have been.  ,6,8
MULDER:    When have you proved me wrong?  ,6,8
MULDER:    You didn't want to be there?  ,6,8
"MULDER:    (self-analyzing)  Oh, that's, um... That's self-righteous and... narcissistic of me to say, isn't it?  ",6,8
"MULDER:    Now, um... I know we said that we weren't going to exchange gifts but, uh... I got you... a little something.  ",6,8
MULDER:    Merry Christmas.  ,6,8
"MULDER:   (on phone)   Yeah, in the time that you worked with... Ms. Ermentrout did you find her to be a trustworthy person? (very bored) Punctual.  Punctual is good.  ",6,9
"MULDER:    (hand over the receiver)  Hey, Scully maybe if we get really lucky next time they'll let us clean toilet bowls.  ",6,9
MULDER:    No. That would make way too many people way too happy.  ,6,9
"MULDER:    (surprised)   Just you?    (loudly calling out after her)   Don't forget your toilet brush.   (then quickly into the phone which he hadn't covered)  No. No, ma'am, not you.  ",6,9
MULDER:    Hmm?  ,6,9
MULDER:    Being nosy.  (looking up at her wistfully)  Eating my heart out. They're sending you on an X-File.  ,6,9
MULDER:    That's not what I'm reading.  I'm thinking murder by telekinesis. I'm thinking maybe a shamanistic death touch.  I'm thinking about the Muslim superstition that to photograph someone is to steal their soul.  ,6,9
"MULDER:    So they're splitting us up, huh?  ",6,9
MULDER:    No?  ,6,9
"MULDER:    Who told you that?  Obviously, if you do a good job they're not going to stick you back here.  ",6,9
MULDER:    Right?  ,6,9
"MULDER:    (polite, but unenthusiastic)   A pleasure to meet you,  Peyton.  ",6,9
"MULDER:   (on phone, disguising his voice Thurston Howellishly - very cute) Hi. My name is Fox Mulder.  We used to sit next to each other at the FBI.  ",6,9
"MULDER:   (on phone, normal voice)   How's your X-File coming?  ",6,9
MULDER:   (on phone)   You can't hold him?  What about the stabbing?  ,6,9
MULDER:    I told you I'm nosy.  Why are you letting him go?  ,6,9
"MULDER:   (on phone)   But you still think Fellig's a murderer, huh?  ",6,9
"MULDER:   (on phone)   As in he, uh, plugs up like a cork when you stab him?  ",6,9
"MULDER:   (on phone)   Well, young man Ritter has been sending progress reports to Kersh.  My computer may have inadvertently intercepted a few of those.  He's got nice things to say about you, though... mostly.  Why don't you let me do a little background check on Fellig for you.  ",6,9
"MULDER:   (on phone)   Come on. It's, you know... it's what I do now.  I'm getting good at it.  ",6,9
"MULDER:   (on phone)   Hey, Scully, uh, how's that X-File coming?  And before you tell me that it's not an X-File...  ",6,9
MULDER:   (on phone)   What happened?  ,6,9
"MULDER:   (on phone)      Oh, yeah?   Well, that's not surprising, given that he's reached the ripe old age of 149.  ",6,9
MULDER:   (on phone)   I did a little low-tech  background check on him. This stuff is so old that they don't even keep it on record on the computer but Alfred Fellig doesn't exist before 1964 but one Henry Strand does. He applied for a press pass from the Jersey City police in 1939 at the age of 53.  His prints match Fellig's.  ,6,9
"MULDER:   (on phone)   You think? Because this Henry Strand does not exist before 1939.  However, one L.H. Rice is on record as having sat for the New York State civil service exam.  Now, the records don't show whether he passed or not but his thumbprint? Fellig's.  Want to know what L.H. Rice's birthday is? April 4, 1849.  I'm not good at math, but I'm figuring that's a whole lot of candles on the cake.  ",6,9
"MULDER:   (on phone)   I-I think that's what he wants you to think.  Now we're talking about a guy for whom the phrase ""life in prison"" carries some seriously weighty connotations.  I think you should get to him before he vanishes and becomes someone else.  ",6,9
MULDER:   (on phone)   Mulder.  ,6,9
MULDER:   (on phone)   Hi.  ,6,9
MULDER:   (on phone)   Yeah. Henry Srand and L.H. rice.  ,6,9
"MULDER:   (on phone)   Uh, no, but there's a... there's, like, a big gap before 1939.  ",6,9
"MULDER:   (on phone)   Absolutely, yeah.  ",6,9
"MULDER:   (on phone)   Agent Ritter, it's Agent Mulder.  Is Agent Scully there with you?  ",6,9
"MULDER:   (on phone)   Me neither, and D.C. Cellular says her phone is turned off.  ",6,9
"MULDER:   (on phone)   Well, you can find her for me.  ",6,9
"MULDER:   (on phone)   Good, because that's where I think she is. And you were right, Fellig is a murderer.  Under the name of Louis Brady, he suffocated two patients in a Connecticut hospital. He says he meant to catch up with death. One year into his prison sentence he walked off a work detail.  The manhunt never officially ceased.  ",6,9
MULDER:   (on phone)   1929.  ,6,9
"MULDER:   (on phone)   Look, Ritter,  don't sweat the math. It's him. Just get there and find Agent Scully.  ",6,9
MULDER:    (flatly)  You're a lucky man.  ,6,9
"MULDER:    Coroner's report came back on Fellig.  Says he died of a single gunshot wound.  That's all it said.  (sits on the bed beside her)   Well, I, uh... talked to your doctor and... he says you're doing great.  You're making the fastest recovery he's ever seen.  ",6,9
"MULDER:    No, no, I-I... I think he would have.  I-I just think that  that death only looks for you... once you seek its opposite.  ",6,9
"MULDER:    I just, uh... I thought I'd poke my head in and say hey.  ",6,10
"MULDER:    (smiling)   What, are you sleeping one off?  ",6,10
"MULDER:    You going to be all right, sir?  ",6,10
MULDER:    He's going to tell you he's all right.  ,6,10
MULDER:    He's having trouble with his eyes.  He's also got a nasty bruise on his ribcage.  ,6,10
MULDER:    That was the second opinion.  The first was unsolicited.  A phone call at the hospital.  A scrambled voice telling him he had 24 hours to live.  ,6,10
MULDER:    To scare you.  See what you'd do.  Who you'd turn to.  ,6,10
MULDER:    Or about the X-Files.  ,6,10
MULDER:    What happened today?  Anything out of the ordinary?  ,6,10
"MULDER:    This morning, you woke up...  ",6,10
MULDER:    Alone?  ,6,10
MULDER:    And how'd you get to the office?  ,6,10
MULDER:    Just slow down.  One step at a time.  How'd you get from the parking garage to your office?  ,6,10
MULDER:    And then what?  ,6,10
MULDER:    Now think.  There's got to be something.  ,6,10
MULDER:    Did he touch you?  ,6,10
MULDER:    What time was it?  ,6,10
MULDER:    There you are.  ,6,10
MULDER:    (reading the log)  He signed in here as a visitor to the office of Assistant Director Walter Skinner.  ,6,10
MULDER:    St. Katherine's.  ,6,10
"MULDER:    Dr. Orgel, you visited the FBI this morning.  You came to see Mr. Skinner.  ",6,10
MULDER:    Go around back.  ,6,10
MULDER:    Drop the gun.  Drop it!  ,6,10
"MULDER:    Yeah, so's your mom.  ",6,10
"MULDER: Hey, give it a rest, huh?!  ",6,10
MULDER:    What?  ,6,10
MULDER:    (looking at the veins on SKINNER's neck)   You need to get to a hospital.  ,6,10
MULDER:    This is a crime scene.  What would you rather I be doing?  ,6,10
"MULDER:    I'd be a lot more concerned with the preservation of Dr. Orgel. (In the trash, MULDER finds a picture of DR. ORGEL and SENATOR MATHESON - MULDER's patron from first season - smiling as they hold a official looking folder between them.)   Hello, Senator...  ",6,10
"MULDER:    Actually, time is my only consideration, Senator.  (shows him picture)  This was taken only three days ago.  It's of you and Dr. Kenneth Orgel holding a Senate Resolution-S.R. 819, I think it's called.  What is that?  ",6,10
"MULDER:    A friend of mine is going to die because of S.R. 819.  I don't know how, I don't even know why but I'm betting you do.  ",6,10
"MULDER:    I don't even really know yet; all i have are a few pieces: a Tunisian diplomat, this Dr. Kenneth Orgel, this health bill, S.R. 819-- all leading up to a plot to kill an Assistant Director of the FBI.  Does that make sense?  ",6,10
MULDER:    This man may die; he may only have a few hours to live.  ,6,10
"MULDER:    Hey, do you have the key to this drawer?  ",6,10
MULDER:    AD Skinner's in the hospital.  Somebody poisoned him.  ,6,10
MULDER:    For doing his job.  ,6,10
"MULDER:    I'm looking for anything that relates to a Senate Resolution: S.R. 819. If you want to save his life, you'll help me open this drawer.  ",6,10
MULDER:    You have a letter opener?  In your desk?  Something?  ,6,10
MULDER: What's his condition?  ,6,10
"MULDER:    Well, can you fight it?  ",6,10
MULDER:    Maybe we do.  ,6,10
MULDER:    I found this with Skinner's morning mail.  He was doing a security check on a Senate bill for violation of trade laws involving sensitive technology.  ,6,10
MULDER:    No. This bill was going to vote in the Senate.  All it was waiting on was Skinner's review and an analysis by Dr. Kenneth Orgel.  ,6,10
MULDER:    No. Orgel didn't poison anybody.  Orgel came to the FBI to tell Skinner what he knew-- that there was a gross violation of export laws involving new technology.  ,6,10
MULDER:    You know what that means?  ,6,10
MULDER:    That's not me.  ,6,10
MULDER:    Thank you.  (into phone)  Hello.  ,6,10
MULDER:    It's a computer synth voice.  ,6,10
MULDER:    Somebody that must know he's here.  ,6,10
MULDER:    Federal agent!  Stop right there!  ,6,10
MULDER:    Hey!  ,6,10
MULDER:    What other forensic evidence were you able to lift?  ,6,10
MULDER:    (looking at the hairs)  Don't hate me 'cause I'm beautiful.   What else?  ,6,10
MULDER:    From where?  ,6,10
MULDER:    Where is he?  Where's Orgel?  ,6,10
MULDER:    I don't believe you.  You lied to me this morning; you're lying to me now.  ,6,10
MULDER:    Where is Orgel?!  I need to know what he knows.  A friend of mine is dying.  ,6,10
"MULDER:    Tell me what you know, Senator.  This is about S.R. 819 isn't it? What the hell did they put in Skinner?  ",6,10
MULDER:    It's the same technology that S.R. 819 will export.  ,6,10
"MULDER:    Nanotechnology.  Microscopic, atom-sized machines?  Machines can be stopped.  ",6,10
MULDER:    I don't believe that.  ,6,10
MULDER:    Not before I expose you and your role in this.  ,6,10
MULDER:    I will stop this!  ,6,10
"MULDER:    The man who poisoned you was at the FBI that day.  Scully was able to pull these off the security video tapes. (hands two pictures of the BEARDED MAN to SKINNER)   Hopefully, it might jog your memory.  Maybe you can identify this man.  ",6,10
MULDER:    S.R. 819 was withdrawn by committee late last night.  Without explanation.  ,6,10
"MULDER:    If that was his true motive.  If he wanted to poison you to prevent you from investigating S.R.  819, why call you to tell you that?  This man worked for the government that was to receive this technology.  He drove one of their cars and he killed one of his own to save you.  ",6,10
"MULDER:    Yes. Yes, I do.  And I have an idea who may be behind all this. But I'd need your authority to continue the investigation.  ",6,10
MULDER:    Game.  ,6,11
"MULDER:    Hey, Homegirl, word up.  ",6,11
"MULDER:   Oh,  Scully, I got game.  ",6,11
"MULDER:    No, I'm ready to J-O-B just not on some jagoff shoeshine tip.  ",6,11
MULDER:    (smile)  No background checkin' jagoff shoeshine tip.  ,6,11
MULDER:    (more serious)  About what?  ,6,11
"MULDER:    You looking for work, Agent Spender?  'Cause if you are, I got a whole pile in that middle drawer that I'd love to shove down someone's throat.  ",6,11
MULDER:    They found your mother.  ,6,11
MULDER:    I didn't hear the magic word.  ,6,11
"MULDER:    Are you asking me, Agent Spender?  ",6,11
"MULDER:    The truth is out there, Agent Spender.  Maybe you should find it for yourself.  ",6,11
MULDER:    Where did you expect to find me?  ,6,11
MULDER:    It wasn't exactly an offer.  ,6,11
MULDER:    It is an opportunity made to order for the powers that be.  ,6,11
MULDER:    This is exactly the kind of mistake they've been waiting for to come down on me full force.  ,6,11
MULDER: LIKE I SAID: not exactly.  ,6,11
"MULDER:    (looking at her, gently)  I know.  ",6,11
MULDER:    I have no doubt that what Cassandra would tell us would expose more than just what happened to her.  ,6,11
MULDER:    Shh.  Shhh.  Shhhh.  ,6,11
MULDER:    (nervous chuckle)   Don't... don't do that.  ,6,11
MULDER:    Look at you.  ,6,11
"MULDER:    Well, I had reasons for doubt when I met you, Cassandra.  ",6,11
MULDER:    Then where is she?  ,6,11
MULDER:    What?  ,6,11
MULDER:    What are they here for?  ,6,11
MULDER:    It's the virus--  the black oil.  ,6,11
MULDER:    And you know who these men are?  ,6,11
"MULDER:    They're going to be monitoring any work on our machines, in or out. We need access to files.  And a name that'll raise flags.  ",6,11
MULDER:    Smokey's got a name.  ,6,11
MULDER:    Who?  ,6,11
MULDER:    What's that?  ,6,11
MULDER:    What's it stand for?  ,6,11
"MULDER:    Scully, you want to go one-on-one?  We got nothing but time now that we're on administrative leave.  ",6,11
MULDER:    Nothing you could ever find would be accurate or credible.  ,6,11
MULDER:    That's C.G.B. Spender and my father.  ,6,11
MULDER:    That's the same night as my sister.  ,6,11
MULDER:    The project is still going on.  ,6,11
MULDER:    (quietly)  Thanks for coming.  I know it's late and you've been forbidden to have any contact with us.  ,6,11
MULDER:    Her life's been in danger going on 30 years... just not the way I think it is now.  ,6,11
MULDER:    Men who've conducted medical experiments in what began as a secret government project but what is now the most private global enterprise.  ,6,11
MULDER:    To develop alien/human hybrids that will survive the viral apocalypse when aliens colonize the earth.  ,6,11
"MULDER:    Files that Agent Scully dug up that make all the right connections to Dr. Eugene Openshaw to my sister, to my father... to Agent Spender's father.  ",6,11
MULDER:    The Smoking Man.  ,6,11
MULDER:    I know that Agent Scully has her doubts about the purposes of these experiments but I also know that she herself believes she was a test subject when she was abducted four years ago.  ,6,11
MULDER:    Because I believe Cassandra Spender represents the final stages of these experiments-- that she may very well be the first successful alien/human hybrid.  ,6,11
MULDER:    Because... the men who created her would rather kill her than let her expose the enterprise.  ,6,11
MULDER:    Assigned by Agent Spender?  ,6,11
MULDER:    Cassandra?  ,6,11
MULDER:    How did you get here?  How did you get out of your room?  ,6,11
MULDER:    Let go!  ,6,11
"MULDER:    Stand away, Scully.  ",6,11
"MULDER: (voiceover)  Two men, young, idealistic - the fine product of a generation hardened by world war.  Two fathers whose paths would converge in a new battle - an invisible war between a silent enemy and a sleeping giant on a scale to dwarf all historical conflicts.  A 50-years war, its killing fields lying in wait for the inevitable global holocaust.  ",6,12
"MULDER:    (voiceover)   Theirs was the dawn of Armageddon.  And while the world was unaware, unwitting spectators to the hurly-burly of the decades-long struggle between heaven and earth there were those who prepared for the end; who measured the size and power of the enemy, and faced the choices: stand and fight, or bow to the will of a fearsome enemy.  Or to surrender - to yield and collaborate. To save themselves and stay their enemy's hand.  Men who believed that victory was the absence of defeat and survival the ultimate ideology... No matter what the sacrifice.  ",6,12
MULDER:    Who are you!  ,6,12
MULDER:    Who are you?!  ,6,12
MULDER:    What's going on?!  ,6,12
MULDER:    Who are you?!  ,6,12
MULDER:    Who are you?!  ,6,12
MULDER:    There must be some kind of mistake.  I signed up for the aroma therapy treatment.  ,6,12
MULDER:    Where the hell do you think we are?  ,6,12
MULDER:    Who called you?  ,6,12
MULDER:    (patiently)  Scully...  ,6,12
MULDER:    (firmly)   Scully...  ,6,12
MULDER:    Hey... I heard gray is the new black.  ,6,12
"MULDER:    (sarcastic)  No. Actually, you hide your feelings very well.  ",6,12
MULDER:    Apparently not. I just spoke to AD Skinner.  He was at the hospital when Cassandra went missing.  He heard Spender make the phone call to the CDC.  ,6,12
"MULDER:    Well, then why did she come to my apartment demanding to be killed?  ",6,12
"MULDER:    No. It won't continue.  It doesn't have to anymore.  She knows what she is, Scully.  That's why it's so dangerous for her to be alive.  That's why she came to my apartment asking to be killed.  ",6,12
"MULDER:    I think she's the one, Scully.  ",6,12
"MULDER:    Hello?  Hello?  Oh, oh, Ma'am.  These shoes?  They're, they're two sizes too small.  I was wondering if I could get a ...  ",6,12
"MULDER:    (frustrated)   A pair that fit, maybe?  ",6,12
MULDER:    Marita?  ,6,12
MULDER:    Who?  ,6,12
MULDER:    What have they done to you?  ,6,12
MULDER:    Like the tests on Cassandra Spender?  ,6,12
MULDER:    Then what were the tests on you?  ,6,12
MULDER:    In secret from the alien colonists.  The hybrid program was in cooperation with the aliens but the conspirators never intended to succeed... to finish the work.  ,6,12
MULDER:    To make a vaccine and build a weapon.  ,6,12
"MULDER:    She's the first, isn't she? She's the first successful alien/human hybrid.  ",6,12
MULDER:    The latest in home security.  ,6,12
MULDER:    I got a call from Scully.  Said it was urgent.  ,6,12
MULDER:    (sigh)  I don't have time for this.  ,6,12
"MULDER:    I know her, Scully. You don't.  ",6,12
MULDER:    (gives a sarcastic melodramatic gasp)  I hope you've got something more than that to indict her with.  ,6,12
MULDER:    For the purpose of what?  ,6,12
MULDER:    MUFON.  ,6,12
MULDER:    So she's collecting data.  Big deal.  ,6,12
"MULDER:    Scully, you're reaching.  ",6,12
MULDER:     So you're suggesting that Diana is monitoring these abductees? Monitoring these tests?  ,6,12
MULDER:    Because you've given me no reason here to do otherwise.  ,6,12
"MULDER:    Scully, you're making this personal.  ",6,12
MULDER:    Diana?  Diana?  ,6,12
MULDER:    (aiming gun at CIGARETTE SMOKING MAN)    Sorry.  Nobody home. What are you doing here?  ,6,12
MULDER:    Interesting company you keep.  ,6,12
"MULDER:    You feeling smug, C.G.B.?  Yeah, I know your name.  I know your game and I got nothing to lose.  ",6,12
MULDER:    Why?  ,6,12
MULDER:    That presumes my cause is wrong.  ,6,12
"MULDER:    I'm not the one using innocent people - innocent women - as lab rats, trying to create a hybrid - an alien/human hybrid - so that I might save my own sorry ass when they finally come knocking...  ",6,12
MULDER:    You find that funny?  ,6,12
MULDER:    He didn't give up my sister.  He was forced to.  You made him do it.  ,6,12
MULDER:    Towards your own selfish end.  ,6,12
"MULDER:    No, you only managed to postpone it.  ",6,12
MULDER:    You put those lives on hold so you alone could survive.  ,6,12
MULDER:    You gave them your children! You gave them your wife! You sent them away... like they were things.  ,6,12
MULDER:    You sent them away to be tested on.  ,6,12
MULDER:    You're a liar.  My sister wasn't taken from any hangar.  She was abducted from our home right in front of me.  ,6,12
"MULDER:    (lowering the gun, walking away)   And now you've succeeded?  ",6,12
MULDER:    To work secretly on a vaccine.  ,6,12
MULDER:    You can't do that.  ,6,12
MULDER:    (standing)   Stop it now or I will stop it.  ,6,12
MULDER:    You stop it... or everyone dies.  ,6,12
MULDER:    I'm sorry.  I didn't  mean to scare you.  ,6,12
MULDER:    Nothing.  Not a damn thing.  ,6,12
MULDER:    I came here looking for evidence.  ,6,12
MULDER:    Evidence that you'd lied to me-- that you had loyalties other than to me or to the X-Files.  ,6,12
MULDER:    I didn't find anything Diana.  But something found me.  ,6,12
MULDER:    Fate.   Destiny.  Whatever it's called when you... when you realize the choices you thought you had in life were already made.  ,6,12
MULDER:    You were being paid a visit by young Jeffrey Spender's father.  The Cigarette-Smoking Man came looking for his son who has now taken up the futile cause that used to be mine-- against his father.  ,6,12
"MULDER:    Because there's nothing to be done.  And at some point, you just have to accept that the only way those you love are going to survive is if you give up.  ",6,12
MULDER:    That's where it all begins. That's where we need to be if we want to survive it.  ,6,12
"MULDER:   (on phone)   Hey, Scully. It's me.  ",6,12
MULDER:   (on phone)   I'm with Diana.  ,6,12
MULDER:   (on phone)   No. We're coming to get you.   You're coming with us.  ,6,12
"MULDER:   (on phone)   Cassandra's gone, Scully.  ",6,12
"MULDER:   (on phone)   Scully, it's no use.  ",6,12
MULDER:   (on phone)   Going where?  ,6,12
MULDER:   (on phone)   Who gave you this information?  ,6,12
MULDER:    All right.  I'm going to send you on ahead.  ,6,12
MULDER:    This may be our last chance to stop them.  ,6,12
"MULDER:    Turn around.  Turn around, Scully.  ",6,12
MULDER:    I think this is him.  ,6,12
MULDER:    Our lives are in danger.  We don't have much time.  ,6,12
"MULDER:    If somebody overheard us, it might create mass panic.  ",6,12
MULDER:    El Rico Air Base.  ,6,12
MULDER:    I've had answers for years.  ,6,12
MULDER:    No one would ever listen.  ,6,12
MULDER:    They burned themselves.  With a choice made long ago by a conspiracy of men who thought they could sleep with the enemy.  Only to awaken another enemy.  ,6,12
"MULDER:    It means the future is here, and all bets are off.  ",6,12
"MULDER:    Wow.  Take a look at this. Honey, what do you think?  Is this place us or what? [Closed captioning also has: ""Check this out, sweetie.""]  ",6,13
"MULDER:    (shaking her hand)   I'm Rob...  (puts his hands affectionately on SCULLY's shoulders)  ... and this is my lovely wife, Laura.  ",6,13
MULDER:    Like the dish.  ,6,13
MULDER:    Wow.  The photos did not do it justice.  ,6,13
MULDER:    The previous owners left it so clean.  ,6,13
"MULDER:    (big grin, putting his arm around SCULLY's shoulders and hugging her)   Yeah, I, uh... I work mostly at home which is great for Laura because she gets me all to herself.  ",6,13
MULDER:    Yep.  ,6,13
"MULDER:    Hi, Win. Nice to meet you.  ",6,13
"MULDER:    Thank you.  Thanks.  Oh, thank you.  Thanks.  Thank you.  Thank you.  ",6,13
"MULDER:    Uh, you can put that in the driveway.  ",6,13
"MULDER:    Stand out, Win?  ",6,13
MULDER:    (unsure what else to say)  Just... put it in the garage.  ,6,13
"MULDER:    Oh, yeah.  Nothing weird going on around here.  (following SCULLY) Hey... ooh, wait a minute.  You didn't let me carry you over the threshold.  ",6,13
"MULDER:    Let's get it on, honey.  ",6,13
MULDER:    Not that it makes much difference.  This place is so clean you could build computer chips.  ,6,13
MULDER:    That's pretty surprising considering how nutty this bunch is about being neighborly.  ,6,13
MULDER:    (seductively)   You want to make that honeymoon video now?  ,6,13
"MULDER:    ""Pee-trie.""  ",6,13
MULDER:    Fine.  ,6,13
MULDER:    I'm taking it seriously.  I just don't understand why we're on it. It's our first catch back on the X-Files.  This isn't an X-File.  ,6,13
MULDER:    Wow.  Admit it: you just want to play house.  ,6,13
"MULDER:    (demanding)  Woman, get back in here and make me a sandwich!  ",6,13
MULDER:    Did I not make myself clear?  ,6,13
MULDER:    The name ... is Rob.  ,6,13
MULDER:    Looks like whoever cleaned this place maybe missed a spot.  That look like blood to you?  ,6,13
MULDER:    Morning.  ,6,13
"MULDER:    (looking fondly at SCULLY)   Oh, it was wonderful.  We just spooned up and fell asleep like little baby cats.  Isn't that right, Honeybunch?  ",6,13
MULDER:    (indicating the box of dishes)   I'll just leave this here then.  ,6,13
"MULDER:    Be more aesthetically pleasing, huh?  ",6,13
"MULDER:    Oh, Win uh, you mentioned, uh...  that I could talk to someone about putting up my basketball hoop?  Who was that again?  Mr. Gogolak, was it?  ",6,13
MULDER:    You're kidding?  ,6,13
"MULDER:    In other words, anarchy.  ",6,13
MULDER:    Oh.  ,6,13
"MULDER:    (eating)  You've got to love those dolphins ... although they're pretty tasty, too.  ",6,13
"MULDER:    Actually, it was at a UFO conference.  ",6,13
"MULDER:    (putting his arm around SCULLY)   Well, it's not me so much as Laura.  She's quite the New-Ager.  I mean, she's into those magnetic bracelets and crystals and mood rings, what have you. I mean, God bless her she's a sucker for all that stuff.  ",6,13
"MULDER:    Yeah. You know, Win, uh, when you, uh... when you told me this morning that Big Mike was out of town on business ... I don't think that's true.  ",6,13
"MULDER:    Mmm. No, 'cause we called his office, didn't we, Honey?  ",6,13
MULDER:    Yeah.  ,6,13
"MULDER:    We're thinking about getting a dog so we wanted to call him and ask him his advice, whatever,  and see if maybe his office had a forwarding number and they said, you know...  ",6,13
MULDER:    Yeah.  ,6,13
"MULDER:    Mmm.  It's got to be something really freaky-deaky, hunh?  I mean, for him to lie about it like that?  Maybe he's got some wild secret life going on.  ",6,13
MULDER:    But every community has its dark underbelly don't you think?  ,6,13
MULDER:    (whisper)  Here.  Caduceus.  ,6,13
"MULDER:    Yeah, there's no sign of him in his house.  I didn't see him in the storm drain, either.  I take it he's dead, Scully.  ",6,13
"MULDER:    (looking at the bagged handkerchief)  Mmm, maybe Win cleaning up.  ",6,13
MULDER:    I don't know.  ,6,13
"MULDER:    Hey, what do we know about this stuff?  ",6,13
MULDER:    All right.  ,6,13
MULDER:    Why kill Big Mike?  ,6,13
MULDER:    Whoa!  ,6,13
"MULDER:    Compulsive neatness, or a lack thereof.  Have you noticed how everybody around here is obsessed with the neighborhood rules and the CC&Rs? You know what?  You fit in really well here.  ",6,13
"MULDER:    (adjusting the pillows to make himself more comfortable)  Well, anyway, tomorrow I got a, uh, a surefire way of testing out my theory.  ",6,13
"MULDER:    (coaxing)   Come on, Laura, you know... we're married now.  ",6,13
MULDER:    The thrill is gone.  ,6,13
MULDER:    Bring it on.  ,6,13
"MULDER:    Hey, Win.  Want to play ""horse""? (tosses the ball to him)  ",6,13
MULDER:    What am I doing?  ,6,13
MULDER:    (stepping on the goal to keep it upright)    What are you doing?  ,6,13
MULDER:    Why?  What's going to happen if we don't?  ,6,13
"MULDER:    It's just a basketball hoop, Win.  I don't understand why you're getting all bent out of shape.  ",6,13
MULDER:    What's the worst thing that could happen?  I get fined?]  ,6,13
MULDER:    Warned about what?  ,6,13
MULDER:     Stop!  ,6,13
MULDER:    Cami... you all right?  ,6,13
MULDER:    Scull...!  ,6,13
"MULDER:    Tidying up.  Whoever it was, they put away my basketball hoop. Somebody's looking out after us, Scully which may not be a bad thing.  ",6,13
MULDER:    I got a look at that thing that's been scaring everybody and I take it back.  This is an X-File.  ,6,13
MULDER:    Here we go.   Yeah...I'm guessing there's one of these in every yard.  I think this is how this thing travels-- where it lives.  ,6,13
MULDER:    (not quite sarcastic)   Always.  ,6,13
MULDER:    A landfill?  ,6,13
"MULDER:    It does. Somehow, it's one and the same. The Klines?  ",6,13
MULDER:    What if they're still here  ,6,13
MULDER:    Putting in a pool.  ,6,13
MULDER:    (putting his finger to his lips)  Ah... It's not a swimming pool. It's a reflecting pool.  I checked the rules.  (gets the book for reference) There's no rule against putting in a reflecting pool.  It's very tranquil. You'd like it.  ,6,13
"MULDER:    Tasteful, isn't it?  ",6,13
"MULDER:    Gogolak.   Hey, can you get an excavation team out here?  ",6,13
MULDER:    We need to dig deeper.  ,6,13
MULDER:    To price some rattan furniture.  ,6,13
MULDER:    (pushes him into a chair)  Let's start with the Klines.  You're responsible for them being in little pieces in my front yard.  You gave them that lawn ornament.  The guy with the axe?  ,6,13
"MULDER:    Yeah, whirligig.  It's tacky enough to break your rules and your CCRs-- tacky enough to mark the Klines for death.  ",6,13
"MULDER:    (considers for a moment, looks around, then picks up a black statuette)  A tulpa.  It's a Tibetan thought-form.  It's a living, breathing creature willed into existence by someone who possesses that ability-- an ability I think you picked up on your whirligig-buying excursions to the Far East.  Why'd you do it?  I mean, is it so damn important for everybody to have the same color mailbox?  ",6,13
"MULDER:    But you didn't know exactly what you were getting into, did you?  I mean, you can summon its existence, but ... you can give it life, but you can't control it.  The best you can hope for is to stay out of its way.  ",6,13
MULDER:    Scully?  Scully?  ,6,13
MULDER:    Scully?  ,6,13
MULDER:    Scully?  ,6,13
"MULDER:    Scully, hang on.  ",6,13
"MULDER'S ANSWERING MACHINE:   Hi, this is Fox Mulder.  You can leave me a message after the beep.  ",6,14
"MULDER:    Mr. Dales, there's a reason that people don't head out into hurricanes.  ",6,14
"MULDER:    Mr. Dales, can we come in?  ",6,14
MULDER:    She's my partner.  ,6,14
"MULDER:    (crossing to stand beside DALES)   Yes, but she's... she's not the type that's easily persuaded.  ",6,14
"MULDER:    Well, she knows your reputation your early work on the X-Files and she has a knack for getting to the bottom of things.  ",6,14
MULDER:    It was your description that caused Agent Scully's... (smiles)   dubiousness.  ,6,14
"MULDER:    She's missing, too?  ",6,14
MULDER:    It's not a night that anybody should be out in.  ,6,14
MULDER:    Hello!  Mrs. Shipley!  ,6,14
MULDER:    Got the place all boarded up.  It's from the inside.  It makes you wonder how they got out.  ,6,14
MULDER:    There's something on the drainpipe.  I can't get it off.  ,6,14
MULDER:    I don't know if I'm going to need my gun or a harpoon here.  ,6,14
MULDER:    Maybe he was taking a dip... After he finished boarding up the windows.  ,6,14
MULDER:    Must be the bathroom.  Dales told me the wife told him that the... the husband was grabbed from the bathroom.  ,6,14
MULDER:    (flashlight in his mouth)   Can you give me a hand with this?  ,6,14
MULDER:    You can put the gun down.   We're FBI.  ,6,14
MULDER:    We're out here like you.  We're...  ,6,14
"MULDER:    We're out here looking for the Shipleys, too.  ",6,14
MULDER:    Arthur Dales called us.  ,6,14
MULDER:    Does that name mean anything to you?  Arthur Dales?  ,6,14
MULDER:    All right.  ,6,14
"MULDER:    No, I'm not, but I'd like to.  ",6,14
"MULDER:    No, no, no. Not before you help me finish what you interrupted.  ",6,14
MULDER:    Come on.  ,6,14
MULDER:    No one in the bathroom.  The deputy helped me pull off the plywood. There's no sign of anything except more of that slime in the bathtub and maybe three inches of water on the floor.  It's weird. It's like somebody left the taps running before they boarded up the door.  ,6,14
MULDER:    Aren't you even curious what happened to these people?  ,6,14
MULDER:    Don't dismiss him so easily.  He discovered the X-Files 40 years ago.  He's seen things that I've only read about.  ,6,14
MULDER:    (in nature documentary narrator voice)   If the sea is where life began-- where our ancestors first walked ashore-- then who's to say what new life may be developing in its uncharted depths.  ,6,14
"MULDER:    (slight pout)  Well, we should at least tell him that we're giving up... shouldn't we?  ",6,14
"MULDER:    What's the problem, officer?  ",6,14
"MULDER:    (talking over her and rolling up the window)  Thank you very much, sir.  I appreciate the concern.  ",6,14
MULDER:    I was just one howdy do over the line.  ,6,14
"MULDER:    The good thing about zero visibility, Scully?  Can't get any worse.  ",6,14
MULDER:    Nance Road... N-A-N-C-E Road.  ,6,14
MULDER:    (ready to be out of the car)   Not a moment too soon.  ,6,14
"MULDER:    You know, Scully, someday we're going to look back on this and we're going to laugh. We'll just think of it as, uh... you know man pitted against the forces of nature. Think of it as a test of our mettle.  ",6,14
MULDER:    I think that was a-a tree branch. Debris is starting to fly.  ,6,14
"MULDER:    We're not going to dodge any trees in a parked car.  At least if we're driving, we're a moving target.  ",6,14
"MULDER:    (looking out the window)   There's somebody, I think who's about to give us directions.  Who says there's never a cop when you need one?  ",6,14
MULDER:    Forrest Gump.   [Closed captioning said: Yup. Sherlock's patrol car.]  ,6,14
MULDER:    (to himself)   I've heard of passing the time... Ouch.  ,6,14
MULDER:    Looks like he was attacked or stung.   (looking at marks)   What are those?  ,6,14
"MULDER:    Whatever it was, I think it came through the plumbing, through the toilet.  ",6,14
MULDER:    If it's in the plumbing I got to make sure nobody else is in this building.  ,6,14
"MULDER:    Excuse me, sir.  Is everything okay in your apartment?  ",6,14
MULDER:    Do you need some help...  with your television?  ,6,14
MULDER:    No. Do you need medical help?  ,6,14
MULDER:    Who's we?  Who are you talking about?  ,6,14
"MULDER:    You don't know this man, mister...?  ",6,14
"MULDER:    Yeah. Everything in your pockets, too.  ",6,14
MULDER:     Mulder.  ,6,14
"MULDER:    Stay there, Mrs. Suarez.  We're going to make sure your baby makes it safely into the world.  ",6,14
"MULDER:    Walter, Angela... I'm going to have to ask you to leave your apartment and come downstairs with me.  ",6,14
"MULDER:    Right now, I just want to get you someplace where I know you'll be safe.  ",6,14
MULDER:    I don't know but it may have seriously injured a sheriff's deputy.  ,6,14
MULDER:    In the manager's apartment.  It could be in the complex's plumbing now.  ,6,14
MULDER:    (to WALTER)   Kid's going to be a fighter.  (WALTER laughs nervously)   Anybody else in the complex that you know of?  ,6,14
MULDER:    George?  ,6,14
MULDER:    He's going to want to listen to me.  ,6,14
MULDER:    It's for you.  ,6,14
MULDER:    Mr. Vincent!  George Vincent!  ,6,14
"MULDER:    I'm a federal agent, Mr. Vincent.  I'm asking you to open the door.  ",6,14
"MULDER:    Mr. Vincent, your life may be in danger if you refuse to leave your apartment.  ",6,14
"MULDER:    Well, that's great.  But you may not be armed for what it is I'm talking about.  ",6,14
MULDER:    All the nuts roll down to Florida.  ,6,14
"MULDER:    Scully, can I talk to you for a second?  ",6,14
MULDER:    We got to out of here as soon as possible.  ,6,14
MULDER:    We can put the deputy in his car and take him to the hospital.  ,6,14
MULDER:    You mean we're stuck here?  ,6,14
"MULDER:    Well, either he's got no temperature or he's about to spontaneously combust.  ",6,14
MULDER:    Mr. Vincent?  ,6,14
MULDER:    Drop your weapon!  Put it down!'  ,6,14
MULDER:    You didn't see it?  ,6,14
MULDER:    That looks like the four- inch tie-in to the second floor. Whatever it is didn't just rip through the ceiling.   Looks like it ripped right through the pipe.  ,6,14
MULDER:    I don't know.  It must still be in the building.  It's probably in the outflow system.  ,6,14
MULDER:    Someone's already got him by the nugs.  ,6,14
"MULDER:    Scully, that's how this thing is here.  The hurricane is sitting offshore dredging up god knows what and this thing must have been driven into the city's reclamation system through some offshore outfall pipe.  From there it  gained access to the sewer pipes in this building.  ",6,14
"MULDER:    Scully, something welled up out of the uncharted depths of the ocean--  something that had been lying there undiscovered for ages, probably.  ",6,14
MULDER:    He's gone.  ,6,14
MULDER:    No.  He's gone.  The deputy.  ,6,14
MULDER:    I think the deputy went out with the bathwater.  ,6,14
"MULDER:    No, I don't think he was.  ",6,14
"MULDER:    I'm sure she did.  Look, Scully, I think I know why nobody's ever seen this thing before.  It, it just doesn't live in water.  It is water, taking shape only when it attacks, like it did when the hurricane backed seawater into the plumbing.  Virtually unseeable until then.  ",6,14
MULDER:    Maybe you just impeded its reproductive process.  Maybe it needs time to complete its cycle like it had with the Shipleys.  ,6,14
"MULDER:    No, they were when they were attacked just like the deputy was here-- using their bodies to lay its own spawn-- using the body's water content to reproduce itself-- to make itself anew.  ",6,14
MULDER:    We got to get out of here.  ,6,14
MULDER:    We got to get to another building.  ,6,14
"MULDER:    We can use the deputy's Prowler.  How many people?  We got two, four... (realizes DOUGIE THE LOOTER is missing and runs out of the room)   son of a bitch.  ",6,14
MULDER:    Yeah?  ,6,14
"MULDER:    (laughing)  Oh, no.  ",6,14
"MULDER:    She didn't save my life, really...  ",6,14
MULDER:    No. No no no no  I-I saw the Shipley's cat.  ,6,14
"MULDER:    I saw the cat, which had been saved which had been in the washing machine.  And the Shipleys had boarded up their house which means that the only way they could have vanished was if the creature came up through the plumbing in a backwash of seawater  seawater.  And then the deputy who vanished from a bathtub full of Epsom salts.  ",6,14
MULDER AND SCULLY:    (together)   No.  ,6,14
"MULDER:    Son of a... (grunts what sounds like ""Damn it."")  ",6,15
MULDER:    (disgusted)  Yes... Yes.  ,6,15
MULDER:   (on phone)   Hello?   .  It's coming through down there?  Ugh!  It's my damn waterbed.  My damn waterbed sprung a leak.  I-I-I know I'm not supposed to have a waterbed.   I don't know what to tell you.   I-I think it was a gift.   All right.  ,6,15
MULDER:    I know.  I missed the meeting.  ,6,15
MULDER:    What are you doing down here?  ,6,15
"MULDER:    (sarcastically)  I'm having the best damn day of my life.  Any moment I'm about to burst into song-- ""Zip a dee doo dah.""  My, uh, waterbed sprung a leak and shorted out my alarm clock.  (SCULLY blinks in surprise.) My cell phone got wet and crapped out on me and the check I wrote my landlord to cover the, uh, damages is going to bounce if I don't deposit my pay.  You ever have one of those days, Scully?  ",6,15
"MULDER:    Bank's just down the street.  I'll be back in ten.  Cover for me, will you?  ",6,15
MULDER:    (kneeling)  You're the boss.  ,6,15
MULDER:    (quietly to the WOMAN)  It's all right.  ,6,15
"MULDER:    (disgusted, to himself)   Zip a dee doo dah.  ",6,15
"MULDER:    (to BERNARD)   Hey, lock the doors. You forgot to lock the front door.  ",6,15
"MULDER:    Oh, son of a...  ",6,15
MULDER:    Son of a bitch.  ,6,15
MULDER:    Oh...  that's great.  ,6,15
"MULDER:    (on phone)  Yeah?  It's coming through down there?   It's my damn waterbed.    It sprung a leak.    Yeah, I know I'm not supposed to have a waterbed.    I don't know what to tell you.    I... I... I'm sorry.  I mean, I...  ",6,15
MULDER:    Aw...  Damn it.  ,6,15
MULDER:    I know.  I missed the meeting.  ,6,15
"MULDER:    What are you doing down here, then?  ",6,15
"MULDER:    Scully, did you ever have one of those days you wish you could rewind and start all over again from the beginning?  ",6,15
MULDER:    So you think it's all just fate?  We have no free will?  ,6,15
"MULDER:    And all the rest is just preordained?  I don't buy that.  There's too many variables.  Too many forks in the road.  I meant to be on time to work this morning but my waterbed springs a leak flooding my apartment (SCULLY looks surprised)  and the apartment below me so that makes me late for the meeting. Then I realize I got to write a check to cover the damages to my landlord but, as I'm walking to work, I realize that that's gonna bounce unless I deposit my pay.  So now I got to go to the bank, which makes me even later.  ",6,15
"MULDER:    I might just as easily not have a waterbed then I'd be on time for this meeting.   You might just as easily have stayed in medicine and not gone into the FBI, and then we would never have met.  Blah, blah, blah...  ",6,15
"MULDER:    Free will. With every choice, you change your fate.  ",6,15
MULDER:    (amazed at his own stupidity)    I endorsed my damn check stub.  ,6,15
MULDER:    Excuse me?  ,6,15
MULDER:    I'm sorry.  Do I know you?  ,6,15
MULDER: .  I pass you... and then we die.  ,6,15
MULDER:    Drop your weapon!  ,6,15
MULDER:    What do you think I'll do then?  ,6,15
"MULDER:    Bernard... that's your name, right?  ",6,15
MULDER:    You can end this the right way.  ,6,15
MULDER:    Noooo!!!  ,6,15
"MULDER:   (on phone, impatiently)   Yeah, I know.  Yeah, I know.  I-I know already.   I'll pay for it.  ",6,15
"MULDER:    Oh, hey.  ",6,15
MULDER:    Did I miss the meeting?  ,6,15
"MULDER:    Wow, that is so strange.  ",6,15
MULDER:    I just got the weirdest sensation of deja vu.  I've been having it all morning.  ,6,15
"MULDER:    Yeah, but never to this degree.  I mean, I woke up, I opened my eyes I was soaking  wet...  ",6,15
MULDER:    It's a long story but I had the distinct sensation that I had lived that moment before.  ,6,15
MULDER:    I wonder what it means.  ,6,15
"MULDER:    Well, you know, some Freudians believe the deja vu phenomenon to be repressed memories escaping the unconscious.  That it represents a desire to, uh, have a second chance to set things right.  ",6,15
MULDER:    Whatever's wrong.  ,6,15
"MULDER:    Yeah? Well, but what if it were?  ",6,15
MULDER:    Yeah-- so that I could right some wrong or change fate.  ,6,15
"MULDER:    No.  Actually, I'm fated to go to the bank.  ",6,15
MULDER:    Cradock. Right down the street.  ,6,15
MULDER:    What?  ,6,15
MULDER:    What did she look like?  ,6,15
MULDER:    I'll use the ATM machine.  I don't want to tempt fate.  ,6,15
"MULDER:     You match a description.  You're the, uh...you're the woman that gave a warning to my partner, aren't you?  (She nods.)  Uh... Have we met?  ",6,15
MULDER:    What always ends the same?  ,6,15
MULDER:    We go inside the bank... and we all die.  That's what you told my partner.  Is... is something going to happen inside the bank?  Is there going to be a robbery?  ,6,15
MULDER:    You're saying this day repeats over and over again.  ,6,15
"MULDER:    If what you're saying is true, how come I don't remember it?  How come you're the only one?  ",6,15
MULDER:    51. What's the answer?  ,6,15
"MULDER:    (interrupting)  Um, excuse me uh... Agent Arnold.  Um, where's Scully?  ",6,15
"MULDER:    Uh, excuse me.  Um...  ",6,15
MULDER:    Drop your weapon!  ,6,15
MULDER:    (quietly repeating to himself)  He's got a bomb.  He's got a bomb. He's got a bomb.  He's got a bomb.  He's got a bomb.  He's got a bomb.  He's got a bomb.  He's got a bomb.  ,6,15
"MULDER:    I know, I know.  I missed the meeting.  ",6,15
"MULDER:    (touching her shoulder familiarly and leaving the office)   The bank's just down the street.  Cover for me, will you?  ",6,15
MULDER:    Do I know you?  ,6,15
"MULDER:    Yeah, you just look really familiar to me.  ",6,15
"MULDER:    Yeah.  No?  Uh, all right.  I'm-I'm sorry to bother you.  ",6,15
MULDER:    (whispering): ...He's got a bomb.  He's got a bomb.  He's got a bomb.  He's got a bomb.  ,6,15
"MULDER:   (quietly, on phone)   I'm at the bank.  ",6,15
"MULDER:   (on phone)   Scully, I need you to do something for me right now.  ",6,15
MULDER:    (quietly)  Take it.  I'm a federal agent.  I don't want us all to die in here.  ,6,15
"MULDER:    You've got a girlfriend outside in the car and you've got a bomb. Something very bad is going to happen here today and I want you to know that I'm not going to let it happen. But if you walk out that door right now I'm not going to stop you.  You're in charge here, Bernard.  ",6,15
MULDER:    You could change your fate.  ,6,15
"MULDER:    If you don't believe me, ask her.  ",6,15
"MULDER:    Listen to me, Bernard...  ",6,15
"MULDER:    You get her out of here.  You're dooming her.  You're making her live this day over and over again-- her, you, me, all of us.  ",6,15
MULDER:    Every day you die in here and every day it starts all over again. You can't want this for her.  It's hell!  ,6,15
"MULDER:    Put your gun down, Scully.  Trust me, it's the only way to get out of here.  You got to put your gun down and let them out. He's got a bomb.  ",6,15
MULDER:   (on phone)   Yeah?  ,6,15
"MULDER:   (on phone)   I'm late again, aren't I, Scully?  ",6,15
MULDER:   (on phone)   I'll be there in an hour.  ,6,15
"MULDER:   (on phone)  Well, you were there, Scully.  ",6,15
MULDER:   (on phone)   Call it a feeling.  ,6,15
"MULDER:   (on phone, looking at the paper)   I don't think she was an accomplice. I think she was just trying to get away.  ",6,15
MULDER:   (on phone)   I'll be there in an hour.  ,6,15
MULDER:    (not turning around)   I am home.  I'm just feathering the nest.  ,6,16
MULDER:    Two merchant marines found dead this morning in San Pedro  in the hold of their cargo ship.  ,6,16
"MULDER:    (casually, trying to peak her interest, very cute)   On the crime report it says multiple bite wounds.  ",6,16
MULDER:    The Hong Kong manifest has the cargo listed as a dog.  ,6,16
MULDER:    Yo quiero Taco Bell.  That alone is not what drew me to this case. (turns and holds the file out to her)  The two men were found inside the container.  It was locked from the outside.  ,6,16
MULDER:    (sitting close to her)   Dog gone.   Dog gone    (proudly) Doggone.  ,6,16
MULDER:    Local PD wrote it up.  Department of Fish and Wildlife is on the case.  I got an outside source says it was a dog.  ,6,16
MULDER:    Yeah.  ,6,16
MULDER:    Mm-hmm.  ,6,16
MULDER:    A bad dog.  ,6,16
"MULDER:    Officer Jeffrey Cahn?  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:   Yeah?  MULDER:    (showing badge)   I'm Special Agent Fox Mulder with the FBI.  This is my partner, Dana Scully.  I think the LA field office would have contacted you that we were coming down today.  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:    Oh, yeah.  I hope you don't mind -  I had to look around the ship with my men.  We were pretty thorough.  SCULLY:    (looking in the crate)   What did you find?  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:    Nothing conclusive, really, but I can tell you the dog's not likely still on the ship.  MULDER:    How did you determine that?  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:    You ever owned a dog, sir?  MULDER:    Yeah.  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:    Had to clean up after it?  (MULDER smiles, raises his hands in agreement, then claps them together and goes to look at the crate.)  SCULLY:    I don't suppose you can tell us what kind of dog this is.  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:    I'm not really sure.  The man it was shipped to's name is Detweiler.  Dr. Ian Detweiler.  Calls himself a ""cryptozoologist.""  MULDER:    (interested)   Cryptozoologist?  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:    They deal with animals thought to be extinct.  MULDER:    Animals that aren't supposed to exist like Sasquatch and the Ogopogo and the Abominable Snowman and - - -  SCULLY:    (interrupting)   Don't mind him.  He'll go on forever.  Did you have a chance to talk to this Dr. Detweiler?  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:    About five minutes ago.  (DETWEILER enters the hold.)  DETWEILER:    Officer Cahn, any progress?  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:    Agents, this is Dr. Detweiler.  DETWEILER:    Are you from the FBI?  MULDER:    Yes.  DETWEILER:    Who should I be speaking to about the theft of this animal?  MULDER:    Theft? What do you mean theft?  DETWEILER:    This is a very valuable animal that's disappeared.  A rare breed and arguably a priceless specimen.  SCULLY:    A breed of what?  DETWEILER:    Wanshang Dhole. It's a canid.  MULDER:    That's an Asian dog.  Supposed to have been extinct for the last 150 years.  DETWEILER:    (impressed)   Yes. That's right, actually.  SCULLY:    And you have one of these?  DETWEILER:    I was on the expedition that caught it.  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:    Be that as it may-- we now have an unquarantined animal loose.  MULDER:    Loose? Sounds a little more than loose.  It seems to have killed two people.  DETWEILER:    No.  No.   Let me assure you this is not a predatory animal. Chinese folklore has imbued it with mythic qualities.  But it doesn't even hunt-- it scavenges.  (COP calls from the top of the stairs.)  COP:   Where's Officer Cahn?  Hey, Jeff, I just got a report on the radio. Some kind of vicious dog attack in Bellflower.  SCENE 5 BELLFLOWER 9:32 AM  (JAKE CONROY's house.  Crime scene.   MULDER carefully walks across the yard to the fence, avoiding the piles of dog poo.  He looks over the fence just as JAKE CONROY did earlier.  SCULLY walks over to him.  She is carrying an umbrella.)  MULDER:    (indicating the dog poo)  Watch your step.  SCULLY:    Jake Conroy, age 30.  He was employed as a customs agent by the Federal Government.  The bite marks match those of the victims on the Chinese freighter.  In this case, it bit off the man's hand.  There's some talk in the house that he may be involved in the theft of the animal and that it turned on him.  MULDER:    Talk about biting the hand that feeds you.  SCULLY:    Well, it does make sense.  I mean, a victim and his dog are attacked inside of a house with all the doors shut.  It couldn't have happened unless the dog was being kept inside.  MULDER:    If all the doors were shut, how did it get out?  SCULLY:    Well, then what?  MULDER:    I think we're speaking in too common terms about an animal we're calling a dog but which displays none of the behavior of man's best friend.  SCULLY:    You mean covering up crime scenes?  MULDER:    (smiles)  You get a biscuit, Scully.  SCULLY:    So, you're talking about a dog that has human intelligence. (MULDER looks innocent.)  Well, even if there were such an animal where would we even begin to look for one?  MULDER:    With a human that thinks like an animal.  SCENE 6  (MULDER and SCULLY drive up to BERQUIST KENNELS and park in the driveway. Sound of dogs barking.  They approach a young woman digging postholes for a fence near the driveway.)  MULDER:    Karin?  Karin Berquist?  STACY MUIR:    No. Stacy Muir.  Just putting up this fence for her.  She's been having some coyote problems.  You two looking for Karin about boarding?  MULDER:    No, it's actually more of a behavior problem.  SCULLY:    (glancing up at MULDER)  Yeah, he doesn't listen and he chews on the furniture.  (STACY MUIR chuckles.)  MULDER:    (smiling and showing his badge)  Just... can you tell her the FBI's here to see her?  STACY MUIR:    Right this way.  (STACY MUIR leads them into a very dimly lit office.  There are lots of books and artifacts on the walls and the many tables.  All the blinds are closed.)  STACY MUIR:   Karin will be out in a moment, all right?  (STACY MUIR leaves and closes the door behind her.  MULDER and SCULLY are left in the near darkness.)  SCULLY:    You sure this woman's not an authority on bats?  MULDER:    Karin Berquist knows more about canine behaviorisms than anybody on the planet.  She's lived with wild canids and wolves in the wilderness on five different continents.  (opens the blinds on one of the windows)  SCULLY:    How is it that you know so much about her but you don't know what she looks like?  MULDER:    I never actually met her.  SCULLY:    But you assume that she's going to help us?  MULDER:    No, actually, it's not an assumption.  She is the one who told me about his case.  SCULLY:    (curious)  Oh, so you two are chummy?  MULDER:    Well, I've read her books.  SCULLY:    (reading some of the titles)  Ah. The Wolf Inside...  Dogs Don't Lie...  Better Than Human...  Better Than Human?  MULDER:    She's not a real people person.  (SCULLY crosses to a desk, turns on the lamp and aims it at the ""I Want to Believe"" poster on the wall.  It is identical to the one in MULDER's office that burned.)  SCULLY:    Well, she seems to have made a connection to you.  (She and MULDER look at each other.  The door opens and a group of dogs enter followed by KARIN BERQUIST.  She is mid-thirties, dressed all in black and avoids eye contact.)  KARIN BERQUIST:    (to the dogs)  All right... Settle down.  Settle.  (The dogs all sit on the furniture.  KARIN BERQUIST crosses to the window and closes the blinds that they had opened.)  MULDER:    Karin, I'm Fox.  Fox Mulder.  This is my partner, Dana Scully. It's nice to finally meet you.  (shakes her hand)  KARIN BERQUIST:     I wish I'd known.  I don't get many visitors.  Stacy tells me you have a question about behaviorism?  MULDER:    Yeah, it's about the animal I'm tracking.  The one you mentioned in your e-mail - about its intelligence.  KARIN BERQUIST:    Canids' intelligence is far superior to ours if that's what you want to know.  SCULLY:    Intelligence enough to murder?  KARIN BERQUIST:    Murder takes no intelligence.  It's a human behaviorism.  MULDER:    What about hunting?  KARIN BERQUIST:    Coyotes use elaborate trickeries to draw out their prey. Many canids do... alone or in packs.  SCULLY:    What about a Dhole?  KARIN BERQUIST:    If you mean the Wanshang Dhole, it's extinct.  Is there any other reason you came here?  (She looks up at MULDER- SCULLY watches them intently.)  MULDER:    No. Thank you, Karin.  KARIN BERQUIST:    (to the dogs)  Come on.  (The dogs follow her out of the room and she closes the door.)  SCULLY:    Mulder... She's a friend of yours?  MULDER:    We met on-line.  SCULLY:    On-line...  MULDER:    Two professionals exchanging information.  SCENE 7  (Night.  Police truck pulls up to a dark alley.)  OFFICER FIEDLER:   (on radio)   This is Fiedler.  I'm at an alley just south of Cooper in Signal Hill.  Looks like something's been scavenging.  I'm going to check it out.  DISPATCHER:   Copy that.  (He gets out of his truck, gets a long stick out of the back, and heads into the alley.  Using the stick, he roots through some garbage and finds a severed hand, then looks up to see a dog run past the end of the alley.  He goes into the alley and on into a warehouse.  He goes into the basement.  Dark, spooky hallway.   He hears a sudden sound, and turns quickly and sees a shape at the end of the dark hall.)  OFFICER FIEDLER:   Hey!  Hello, sir.  I'm with US Fish and Wildlife.  Maybe you've seen a dog I'm looking for.  (The human figure silently walks toward him.)   OFFICER FEIDLER:   Sir?  Can you hear me?  (The human figure kneels down and slowly changes shape.  It is now a dog.  It begins snarling at OFFICER FIEDLER, then leaps at his throat.  OFFICER FIEDLER screams.)  SCENE 8 8:34 AM  (Warehouse, later.  Crime scene.  MULDER and SCULLY enter and are met by OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN who is extremely upset.)  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:    You want to catch a killer?  You arrest that crypto son of a bitch who shipped that dog over here.  SCULLY:    Is it the same dog?  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:    That's Frank Fiedler over there.  He's a friend of mine.  Damn good at his job.  You think this kind of thing happens here every day?  MULDER:    No, I'm sure it doesn't.  We're just trying to catch this animal just like you though, sir.  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:    Oh, you can catch it.  I want to kill it.  (He walks away from them.  SCULLY sees KARIN BERQUIST, dressed in dark clothes head to toe, enter the warehouse.)  SCULLY:    (quietly to MULDER)   I don't think wolfwoman is here to speak to me about this.  I'll take a look at the body.  (SCULLY leaves MULDER and goes to look at FIEDLER's body.  MULDER almost reaches for her, then sighs and greets KARIN BERQUIST.)  MULDER:     I didn't expect you.  KARIN BERQUIST:    ""Dog eats dogcatcher.""  Story's all over the news this morning.  It's sort of uplifting.  MULDER:    (not amused)   Mm-hmm.  KARIN BERQUIST:    I'm joking.  MULDER:    Mm-hmm.  KARIN BERQUIST:    Sorry.  MULDER:    That's okay.  KARIN BERQUIST:    I thought you might use some help.  MULDER:    You said that a dog or a canid only hunts what it needs but I've got four bodies with bite marks on it from an animal that seems to kill for no other reason.  KARIN BERQUIST:    Who are the victims?  MULDER:    There's two men on the ship that it came in on, a customs agent, and now an officer from Fish and Wildlife.  In fact, all these men could have come in contact with the animal before the attacks.  KARIN BERQUIST:    Classic dominant-alpha territorial behavior.  MULDER:    No. This animal seems to have ranged many miles to make its attacks.  In each case it seems to have outsmarted or at least tricked its victims.  KARIN BERQUIST:    Unlike we homo sapiens a canid's motives are simple and direct.  It would be an extraordinary case to find one who kills for sport. Likely, we may never know.  I'm sure someone will kill it first.  (They look over to where SCULLY is kneeling at the body with DETWEILER.)  MULDER:    This guy over here?  He claims to have caught it once.  Maybe he can catch it again.  He's Dr. Ian Detweiler.  Do you know him?  KARIN BERQUIST:    No, but I dislike him already.  DETWEILER:    I've been over the area.  If that was my animal there's absolutely no evidence of it-- no prints, nothing whatsoever I can find.  MULDER:    But it's still on the loose.  KARIN BERQUIST:    How did you say you caught it originally?  (KARIN BERQUIST and DETWEILER stare at each other.)  MULDER:    Oh, this is Karin Berquist.  DETWEILER:    We tranquilized it after tracking it for two weeks.  KARIN BERQUIST:    You admire it, don't you?  DETWEILER:    I admire its ability to survive.  KARIN BERQUIST:    Think I'll look around, too.  MULDER:    Mm-hmm.  (She goes to another part of the room.  DETWEILER watches her walk away.)  DETWEILER:    Now, that's one strange bird.  (MULDER nods.)  (Outside, OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN is talking on his radio.)  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:    (over radio)   No, I'm leaving my dart gun in the car.  I'm going to live rounds from here on out.  I don't care what the regulations say.  I shouldn't be asked to risk my life and neither should anyone else.  DISPATCHER:   No one's asking you to risk your life, Cahn.  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:    Fiedler's lying dead.  You realize that?  (He hears a noise.  Camera is panning around him and the truck as if something is stalking him.)  DISPATCHER:   Cahn, you still there?  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:    Look, we need more men out here.  How more many people have to go down before you guys listen?  Look, I don't have a photo of this animal.  No one's even seen it.  Let's get more men out here so we can catch it and kill it.  If you want   (Hearing another noise, OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN turns quickly to find DETWEILER standing right behind him, glaring.)  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:    You scared me.  DETWEILER:    You kill that dog, and I'll kill you.  (DETWEILER walks away.)  SCENE 9  (KARIN BERQUIST's office.  She is sitting at her computer.  MULDER sits on her right and SCULLY stands behind them, looking over their shoulders.  There is an image of a dog's paw print on the screen.)  KARIN BERQUIST:    This man Detweiler said he could find no evidence at the scene but with very little effort I was able to find several tracks on the floor of the building where the man was attacked.  SCULLY:    Did they tell you anything?  KARIN BERQUIST:    That this is a large, rangy animal with primitive, even pre-evolutionary aspects.  It isn't perfectly visible, but with the computer I can enhance the prints so that you can see it.  A fifth toe pad on the right paw.  Canids only have four toes.  MULDER:    Uh, he's got a vestigial toe pad on his front paws. Right there.  (MULDER places his hand over hers on the mouse and moves the pointer over another part of the screen.  SCULLY stares at their joined hands.  After a beat, MULDER moves his hand back to his chin.  Everyone is a little tense.)  KARIN BERQUIST:    The dewclaw, serving no purpose now.  Although some believe it was once a prehensile thumb.  SCULLY:    And that's what you think the print indicates?  KARIN BERQUIST:    I am told this animal went in and out of closed buildings.  SCULLY:    Just yesterday you dismissed the possibility outright, that a dog or a... a canid, as you call it, would behave like this.  KARIN BERQUIST:    I dismissed the idea of murder.  SCULLY:    But you'll accept the idea that it behaves in every other way like Jack the Ripper.  KARIN BERQUIST:    (backing down)  I'm just going by the facts.  In Chinese myth the Dhole can be evil, capable of opening doors, stealing wives and disappearing into thin air.  Maybe there is some basis in reality for this trickster myth.  SCULLY:    (looking directly at her, then at MULDER)   Oh, I'm... fairly certain there is.  (Scully leaves the room.  Mulder looks at the monitor.)  CUT TO: (SCULLY is sitting in the car.  MULDER gets in beside her and gets out the key.  He pauses and looks at SCULLY.)  MULDER:    Everything okay, Scully?  SCULLY:    How well do you know this woman, Mulder?  MULDER:    How well do you know anybody you meet on the Internet?  She likes to talk.  SCULLY:  Well,  I question her motives.  MULDER:    You're suggesting that this case was a way to get me out here, to meet me?  (SCULLY doesn't answer.  MULDER smiles.)  MULDER:    I'm flattered, but, no.  I don't know this woman.   I'd go out on a limb and say there's no way in hell she has anything to do with those four people being dead.  SCULLY:    She's enamored of you, Mulder.  Don't underestimate a woman. They can be tricksters, too.  (They share a look.)  SCENE 10 6:21 PM  (RILEY ANIMAL CLINIC.  ANGIE, owner of DUKE the St. Bernard, is talking to the veterinary assistant, PEGGY, in the reception area.)  ANGIE:   So Dr. Riley wanted me to give Duke three pills a day.  Is the one bottle going to be enough?  PEGGY:   Oh, we can get you a refill.  ANGIE:  Okay.  (DETWEILER enters the vet and DUKE begins barking wildly and trying to attack him.)  ANGIE:   Duke Duke  enough!  DETWEILER:    Can't you control your dog?  ANGIE:   I'm sorry.  He gets this way with strangers sometimes.  DR JAMES RILEY:    Let's take him outside.  ANGIE:   Duke, come on.  DR JAMES RILEY:    Excuse me. You got him?  Good luck.  (ANGIE and DUKE leave.  DR JAMES RILEY returns to DETWEILER.)  DR JAMES RILEY:     Sorry about that.  It's usually a well-behaved dog.  DETWEILER:    I'm Dr. Detweiler. I called about the animal tranquilizer.  DR JAMES RILEY:    The Telezol. I don't have much occasion to dispense it.  If I have any, it's very little.  DETWEILER:    Well, I'll take whatever you've got.  (DR JAMES RILEY gets some boxes of medicine off of a shelf.)  DR JAMES RILEY:    I have Etorphine.  Can you use that?  DETWEILER:    Yeah.  DR JAMES RILEY:    Can I ask what these tranqs are for?  DETWEILER:    An animal escaped from a pier in San Pedro.  DR JAMES RILEY:    (concerned)  Not that dog that's been attacking people?  DETWEILER:    If you don't mind, I'm in a bit of a hurry.  DR JAMES RILEY:    Uh, this dog you're looking for-- you're not looking around here?  DETWEILER:    I'm afraid we are.  (DR JAMES RILEY watches as DETWEILER leaves.  Later, he is closing up the clinic.)  DR JAMES RILEY:    (calling to the front of the building)   Good night, Peggy.  [CLOSED CAPTIONING: PEGGY:   Good night.]  DR JAMES RILEY:    Uh, be sure to relock that front door for me, would you? And I'll relock the back.  [CLOSED CAPTIONING: PEGGY:   Sure.]  (DR JAMES RILEY walks through the kennels talking to the dogs.)  DR JAMES RILEY:    Good night, Sparky.  Bye, Dino.  (As he locks the back door and turns off the light, all the dogs in the kennels begin barking.)  DR JAMES RILEY:    Hey, Buck.  What's wrong, Buck?  What's wrong, Buck?  (He turns and sees the red-eyed wolf-like dog snarling at him.  As the dog runs to attack him, DR JAMES RILEY runs to the door to the office and gets the door slammed closed and locked just in time.)   (Later, police cars arrive at the vet clinic.  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN leads the team.)  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:    Come on!  (They run inside and find DR JAMES RILEY.)  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:    Where is it?  DR JAMES RILEY:    He's trapped in a kennel behind that door.  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:    How'd it get in there?  DR JAMES RILEY:    Uh, it must have come around back.  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:    Lowell and Shoen, go around back.  (looks through the frosted window in the door)  All right, I'm going to open the door.  Doc, you're going to have to move back.  I'm going to have to shoot him.   (opens the door quickly and sees the shape of a large dog)   See him!  (OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN fires four shots.)  DR JAMES RILEY:    You hit him?  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:    I think so.  He's down.  (Close up of the dog shows that it is the St. Bernard, DUKE.  DR JAMES RILEY goes over to the wounded dog.)  DR JAMES RILEY:    Duke... It's the wrong dog.  (Later, OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN meets MULDER and SCULLY as they arrive.  It's raining.)  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:    Came out for nothing.  MULDER:    How's that?  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:    Took out somebody's pet.  MULDER:    What kind of pet?  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:    St. Bernard.  It was dark.  I just saw something moving.  (Inside the vet, DR JAMES RILEY is just finishing surgery on DUKE.)  DR RILEY:  Okay, Duke... All done, pal.  You're going to be all right.  Now we got find out how you got back in here, huh?  (Close up on the dog's face.  SCULLY enters the building and finds a picture of KARIN BERQUIST with DR JAMES RILEY.   Signature on the photo says ""To my good friend Jame RileyStay well, Karin""  She hears DR JAMES RILEY screaming and goes to investigate, gun drawn.)  SCULLY:    I'm a federal agent.  I'm armed.  If you can hear me, don't move. Just stay where you are and tell me if you're okay.  (She finds the bloody body of  DR JAMES RILEY on the floor next to the table where DUKE is still lying.  She hears footsteps.)  SCULLY:    Mulder?  MULDER:    Yeah?  SCULLY:    Come take a look at this.  (MULDER enters.  SCULLY is kneeling on the floor beside the body.)  SCULLY:    I'll call the paramedics.  (She and MULDER leave the room.  DUKE morphs into the wolf-like dog and gets off the table.)  SCENE 11  (KARIN BERQUIST is sitting in her dark office with her dogs.   She is looking at her computer monitor.  SCULLY enters alone.)  KARIN BERQUIST:    Where's Fox?  SCULLY:    Continuing his investigation.  (SCULLY walks to a chair near Karin and looks at the dog lying there.  It immediately vacates the chair, and she sits, nicely setting the mood for the rest of the scene, heh heh.)  KARIN BERQUIST:    You're not working together?  SCULLY:    No. This is my investigation.  KARIN BERQUIST:    Of...?  SCULLY:    You.  KARIN BERQUIST:    I have no idea what you mean.  SCULLY:    I thought at first that they were eccentricities or affectations-- the dark, the clothes-- but it's photosensitivity.  Your sleeves cover up skin lesions.  It's why you're here amongst the humans instead of out in the field. Systemic lupus erythematosus.  KARIN BERQUIST:    Lupus... From the Latin for ""wolf.""  Ironic, isn't it?  SCULLY:    Ironic or perverse?  KARIN BERQUIST:    I've ignored the symptoms for years.  I've always felt more like a wolf than a person.  SCULLY:    But not with Mulder.  With Mulder, you found somebody you could communicate with.... someone who challenged you... But that wasn't enough. You needed to lure him out here.  KARIN BERQUIST:    I lack your feminine wiles.  SCULLY:    (looks away for a moment)   You don't believe it, do you-- not for a minute-- that there's an animal out there killing?  KARIN BERQUIST:    I don't believe that this man, Dr. Detweiler, ever caught it.  I lived in Asia.  I know about the Wanshang Dhole and if it survived for over a century it was because it was more cunning than man, more cunning than this man Detweiler ever dreamed of.  SCULLY:    More cunning than you?  (KARIN BERQUIST looks startled.)  SCULLY:    (warning)  I'm watching you.  KARIN BERQUIST:    You watch... But you don't see.  SCENE 12  (At the vet,  MULDER is scraping up bloody goo and going through drawers.   He finds receipt for boxes of the pills that DR JAMES RILEY gave to DETWEILER. He picks up his phone and dials.)  (CUT TO:  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN's car parked outside the warehouse.)  DISPATCHER:   Officer Cahn, we have an emergency phone call we'd like to patch through to you.  Officer Cahn, are you there?   Officer Cahn, please respond. Officer Cahn?  Please respond.  (OFFICER JEFFREY Cahn runs up and picks up the radio.)  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:    (on radio)   This is Jeffrey Cahn. Go ahead.  DISPATCHER:   We have an FBI agent holding for you.  I'm going to patch him through now.  MULDER:  (on phone)    Officer Cahn?  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:   (on radio)   Agent Mulder.  MULDER:  (on phone)    Yeah, I'm back at the animal clinic.  You know Detweiler had been here.  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:   (on radio)   Dr. Detweiler was there?  MULDER:  (on phone)    Yeah. He signed for something.  It looks like, uh... Eet... Etorfeen, Etorphine?  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:    (on radio)   Tranquilizers-- ampules.  MULDER:  (on phone)    Are you anywhere near here at all?  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:    (on radio)   Not far. Why?  MULDER:  (on phone)    You have access to a lab.  There's something I'd like you to check for me.  OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN:    (on radio)   I'll be there in 15 minutes.  (OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN gets into his truck and gets out his keys.  He looks in the rearview mirror and sees the wolf-like dog in the backseat growling at him, eyes glowing red.   He screams at the dog jumps at him.  Exterior shot shows the truck rocking and we hear him yelling.)  SCENE 13 LOS ANGELES COUNTY HOSPITAL TORRANCE , CALIFORNIA  (Next morning.  MULDER enters the hospital and goes to OFFICER JEFFREY CAHN's room.  He is unconscious.  DETWEILER is sitting beside the bed.)  MULDER:    What are you doing here?  DETWEILER:    I'd heard what had happened.  I didn't know how bad he would be. I thought I might get a description of the animal.  MULDER:    How did you learn about the attack?  DETWEILER:    I'd been in contact with Officer Cahn.  I learned through his office.  MULDER:    No, you didn't. No, you hadn't.  Officer Cahn didn't want to have anything to do with you.  DETWEILER:    He was going to kill it.  MULDER:    Does that frighten you?  (pulls him up)  DETWEILER:    (defensive)  Please, sir. This is ridiculous.  MULDER:    You aren't hunting this animal.  You know very well it can't be caught.  DETWEILER:    Then how did I bring it here?  MULDER:    That's what no one can figure out except for Karin Berquist.  She knows what was in that cage and she knows it must be killed and that's the thought she can't bear because she doesn't want this thing to be extinct anymore than you do.  DETWEILER:    You're not making any sense.  MULDER:    No, I think I am.  You went to China looking for that animal and you may have tracked it as you claim but the rest is far from the truth. You found the Wanshang Dhole, but you never caught it.  It caught you.  You may not have known what was happening to you at first but you're well aware now-- that when night comes, you stop being yourself.  DETWEILER:    That's insane.  MULDER:    No, you become the trickster-- a shape-shifting man who becomes an animal.  DETWEILER:    (starting to leave)   I've heard enough.  MULDER:    (stopping him)   No.  You killed because you could.  You may have resisted it at first.  You may have hated what you'd become.  Eventually it took you over.  That's where the tranquilizer came in.  I found traces of Etorphine and animal blood at the clinic.  You injected yourself with the tranquilizer hoping to stop the killings... But they didn't and they haven't and they won't.  (DETWEILER leaves.  As he walks down the hall, he is approached by KARIN BERQUIST.)  KARIN BERQUIST:    I protected you as long as I could.  I won't any longer.  (MULDER comes into the hall and sees them.  They all make eye contact. DETWEILER leaves.)  SCENE 14  (KARIN BERQUIST is sitting at her computer.  Dogs pant contentedly as MULDER enters her office.)  KARIN BERQUIST:    I can usually get a sense of a person right away from the dogs.  Dogs are the best judges of character I know.  (MULDER scratches a dogs head affectionately.  After the dog vacates the chair, MULDER sits across from KARIN BERQUIST, and sighs.)  MULDER:    I'm sensing something myself here.  I'm thinking maybe I've been misled, that you haven't been totally honest with me about this case.  KARIN BERQUIST:    I've been honest with you, though perhaps not myself.  I was looking forward to meeting you.  I wouldn't admit how much.  MULDER:    But you might also have admitted what you knew about this animal-- that it wasn't an animal at all.  KARIN BERQUIST:    I heard the reports and called you out if only so you could disprove them.  What I knew was it couldn't be a dog responsible for those killings.  MULDER:    It's Detweiler, isn't it?  KARIN BERQUIST:    Yes.  MULDER:    So you knew that and didn't say.  KARIN BERQUIST:    I only realized it when I saw him.  My failure was in thinking I was protecting the animal that by deceiving you, it might be captured alive.  He's got to be put down, Fox.  It's the only way to stop this.  MULDER:    I've got Scully on him, tailing him watching his every move.  KARIN BERQUIST:    He'll elude her easily.  MULDER:    So, where's he going to go?  KARIN BERQUIST:    To the man he only wounded-- to the hospital, to finish the kill.  (MULDER picks up her phone and dials.)  MULDER:  (on phone)    Scully, it's me.  You got to get to the hospital.  You got to make sure Cahn is protected.    Yeah, he's in danger.  (While MULDER talks to SCULLY, KARIN BERQUIST looks sadly at the ""I Want to Believe"" poster on her wall.)  SCENE 15  (Hospital corridor.  MULDER enters and finds SCULLY sitting on a couch reading a magazine.  She gets up and faces him as he approaches.)  SCULLY:    (not pleased)   Now tell me why you pulled me away from the suspect and chained me to this chair 'cause I haven't seen hide nor hair of Detweiler since I've been here.  MULDER:    (sitting on the couch)  That's aptly put... but it's not yet dark. You should take a load off. We might be here all night.  SCULLY:    What do you mean?  MULDER:    It's Detweiler... but it's not Detweiler.  It's something that he becomes.  SCULLY:    (warning)    Mulder...  MULDER:    Through some blood curse, this man undergoes some kind of nocturnal transformation.  He becomes the same shape-shifting trickster as that mythical dog.  SCULLY:    So, what is he going to do?  Walk in here, skitter across the linoleum and pee in the corners?  MULDER:    It's about territoriality.  He's going to come back here tonight to make sure his dominance isn't challenged.  He's going to put down the threat he failed to eliminate when he attacked Cahn.  Karin Berquist confirmed it.  SCULLY:    Mulder, the only thing Karin Berquist is interested in is you.  (MULDER chuckles dismissively.)  SCULLY:    You're kidding yourself if you think that she hasn't manipulated this entire situation for her own purposes.  MULDER:    He'll come here tonight, Scully.  You'll see.  (MULDER picks up her magazine to read it.  SCULLY smoothly takes it back and sits beside him  and begins reading.  He sighs and reaches into a pocket - probably for some sunflower seeds.)  CUT TO: BERQUIST KENNELS. 2:02 AM  (KARIN BERQUIST is settling dogs in the outdoor pens for the night.  She hears a noise and senses something near by.)  (Cut back to hospital corridor.  MULDER is reading SCULLY's magazine.  SCULLY sits beside him, head back and snoring softly.  He checks his watch, then stands and gently brushes her face with the magazine.)  MULDER:    Okay. He's not coming.  (SCULLY sighs, waking up slowly.)  SCULLY:    Well, you've got no argument from me.  MULDER:    (disappointed)   He's not coming here tonight.  Karin knew that. She lied to me.  (Cut back to KARIN BERQUIST's office.  She goes upstairs and reluctantly loads a dart  into a tranquilizer gun.   Looking out the window, she sees the dog run across the yard.  Her phone rings and her answering machine picks up.  She takes the phone off the hook.)  MULDER:  (on phone, voice)    Karin, it's Fox Mulder.  If you can hear me, I know what you're doing.  If you can hear me, lock your doors. I'm on my way. (hangs up)  (Downstairs, the dog has entered the house.   It goes upstairs.  She hears a growl and sees the wolf-like snarling at her.  She aims the gun, then slowly sets the gun on the table and faces the dog.)  KARIN BERQUIST:    (softly coaxing)   Come on, dog.  Come on.  (With a final snarl the dog launches himself at her throat.  Outdoor shot shows them both come crashing through the second floor window and falling to the ground.  Dogs bark wildly.)  (MULDER and SCULLY arrive and find DETWEILER's body.)  SCULLY:    Mulder...  MULDER:    Yeah.... It's Detweiler.  (They then see KARIN BERQUIST's body.  SCULLY looks up at MULDER sympathetically.  He shakes his head slightly.)  SCENE 16 X-FILES OFFICE  (MULDER sits with his head in his hands.  SCULLY enters.)  SCULLY:    You going home?  MULDER:    (looking exhausted)   Yeah, pretty soon.  SCULLY:    You think this is your fault.  MULDER:    (sighs)  I think that I... believed her very quickly.  I think maybe that was my fault, yeah.  (SCULLY sits on the corner of his desk.)  SCULLY:    Why wouldn't you believe her?  MULDER:    I barely knew her.  SCULLY:   (gently)   Well, she had a lot of secrets, that's for sure.  I think that Karin Berquist lived by her instincts.  She sized people up pretty quickly and I think she figured you out to a ""T."" (MULDER looks up at her.) I think she saw in you a kindred spirit, Mulder.  She may not have been able to express that to you.  Maybe what she did was the highest form of compliment.  (MULDER looks at her and sighs.)  SCULLY:    You going to be okay?  MULDER:    (smiles)  Uh, yeah.  SCULLY:    Oh.  This came for you.  (She hands him a long mailing tube.)  MULDER:    Thank you.  (SCULLY leaves the office.  MULDER looks at the return address.  It is from BERQUIST KENNELS.  917 Creekview Rd.  Topanga,  CA 90290.  SCULLY gets her jacket and he watches her leave.  He opens the tube and removes a poster.  He looks at it, then pins it to the wall.  He sits in his chair and looks up at it.  It is the ""I Want to Believe"" poster from KARIN BERQUIST's office. )  [THE END]   Return to the Scripts Page ",6,16
"MULDER:    (showing badge)   I'm Special Agent Fox Mulder with the FBI.  This is my partner, Dana Scully.  I think the LA field office would have contacted you that we were coming down today.  ",6,16
MULDER:    How did you determine that?  ,6,16
MULDER:    Yeah.  ,6,16
MULDER:    (interested)   Cryptozoologist?  ,6,16
MULDER:    Animals that aren't supposed to exist like Sasquatch and the Ogopogo and the Abominable Snowman and - - -  ,6,16
MULDER:    Yes.  ,6,16
MULDER:    Theft? What do you mean theft?  ,6,16
MULDER:    That's an Asian dog.  Supposed to have been extinct for the last 150 years.  ,6,16
MULDER:    Loose? Sounds a little more than loose.  It seems to have killed two people.  ,6,16

MULDER:    Talk about biting the hand that feeds you.  ,6,16
"MULDER:    If all the doors were shut, how did it get out?  ",6,16
MULDER:    I think we're speaking in too common terms about an animal we're calling a dog but which displays none of the behavior of man's best friend.  ,6,16
"MULDER:    (smiles)  You get a biscuit, Scully.  ",6,16
MULDER:    With a human that thinks like an animal.  ,6,16
MULDER:    Karin?  Karin Berquist?  ,6,16
"MULDER:    No, it's actually more of a behavior problem.  ",6,16
MULDER:    (smiling and showing his badge)  Just... can you tell her the FBI's here to see her?  ,6,16
MULDER:    Karin Berquist knows more about canine behaviorisms than anybody on the planet.  She's lived with wild canids and wolves in the wilderness on five different continents.  (opens the blinds on one of the windows)  ,6,16
MULDER:    I never actually met her.  ,6,16
"MULDER:    No, actually, it's not an assumption.  She is the one who told me about his case.  ",6,16
"MULDER:    Well, I've read her books.  ",6,16
MULDER:    She's not a real people person.  ,6,16
"MULDER:    Karin, I'm Fox.  Fox Mulder.  This is my partner, Dana Scully. It's nice to finally meet you.  (shakes her hand)  ",6,16
"MULDER:    Yeah, it's about the animal I'm tracking.  The one you mentioned in your e-mail - about its intelligence.  ",6,16
MULDER:    What about hunting?  ,6,16
"MULDER:    No. Thank you, Karin.  ",6,16
MULDER:    We met on-line.  ,6,16
MULDER:    Two professionals exchanging information.  ,6,16
"MULDER:    No, I'm sure it doesn't.  We're just trying to catch this animal just like you though, sir.  ",6,16
MULDER:     I didn't expect you.  ,6,16
MULDER:    (not amused)   Mm-hmm.  ,6,16
MULDER:    Mm-hmm.  ,6,16
MULDER:    That's okay.  ,6,16
MULDER:    You said that a dog or a canid only hunts what it needs but I've got four bodies with bite marks on it from an animal that seems to kill for no other reason.  ,6,16
"MULDER:    There's two men on the ship that it came in on, a customs agent, and now an officer from Fish and Wildlife.  In fact, all these men could have come in contact with the animal before the attacks.  ",6,16
MULDER:    No. This animal seems to have ranged many miles to make its attacks.  In each case it seems to have outsmarted or at least tricked its victims.  ,6,16
MULDER:    This guy over here?  He claims to have caught it once.  Maybe he can catch it again.  He's Dr. Ian Detweiler.  Do you know him?  ,6,16
MULDER:    But it's still on the loose.  ,6,16
"MULDER:    Oh, this is Karin Berquist.  ",6,16
MULDER:    Mm-hmm.  ,6,16

"MULDER:    I'm flattered, but, no.  I don't know this woman.   I'd go out on a limb and say there's no way in hell she has anything to do with those four people being dead.  ",6,16

"MULDER:    No, I don't think so.  Whoever did it took 40 minutes to do it in the middle of a tornado.  What do you make of that?  ",6,17

MULDER:    Dear Diary: Today my heart leapt when Agent Scully suggested spontaneous human combustion.  ,6,17
MULDER:    I don't have a theory.  But I know of someone who does.  ,6,17
MULDER:    An inmate.  ,6,17
MULDER:    Rawls was the prisoner who supposedly died in the tornado that preceded superintendent Fellowes's murder.  ,6,17
"MULDER:    (walking around the room, tapping on walls)  I disagree.  I think this Pinker Rawls is still very much alive. You know, they never found his body.  ",6,17
MULDER:    (still looking around the room)   I can't argue with that.  But I do think it's murder.  ,6,17

"MULDER:    Well, it's not in here.  Hey.  Look at this.  ",6,17

MULDER:    We have a last known address for Pinker Rawls?  ,6,17
MULDER:    This is Rawls's last known address.  Security guard's car.  ,6,17

"MULDER:    Yeah, but Rawls used to live here and he's come back looking for something.  ",6,17

MULDER:    Yeah.  ,6,17
"MULDER:    Yeah, I bet Rawls is looking for her.  ",6,17
MULDER:    Maybe she changed her name.  Maybe she was afraid she'd end up like that.  ,6,17
MULDER:    You might warn them not to shoot to kill. He seems to find that annoying.  ,6,17
MULDER:    They are.  It's just that their composition has been changed just like the handcuffs and just like the prison wall.  ,6,17
"MULDER:    I think they just went right through him, - whsssht - like his wrist went through the handcuffs and like he walked right through that prison wall.  ",6,17
"MULDER:    Changing their composition fundamentally-- making steel brittle, turning lead bullets into powder.  ",6,17
"MULDER:    I don't know how else to explain what happened to that prison superintendent or to poor Mr. Merkle over there, who's got no face anymore.  ",6,17
MULDER:    (small smile)  I'm not saying that it can't be explained scientifically.  Maybe it's the tornado.  You suggested it yourself.  Unusual climatic conditions... high electrical potential...  ,6,17
"MULDER:    Okay, we both agree on who he's looking for?  ",6,17
MULDER:    And do we have any idea of how to find June Gurwitch?  ,6,17
MULDER:    Where'd he go?  ,6,17
MULDER:    Bo Merkle's car is parked down the street.  That's how he got here.  I don't know how he left.  ,6,17
MULDER:    Why would he leave without getting the information he wanted?  ,6,17
MULDER:    (getting in the car with her)   Where to?  ,6,17
MULDER:    June?  ,6,17
MULDER:    Who is Rawls to you?  ,6,17
"MULDER:    What does Rawls want?  The money?  $90,000 from the Bay Saint Louis robbery?  ",6,17
MULDER:    And where's the money now?  ,6,17
MULDER:    (to JUNE)  Give me your keys.  ,6,17
MULDER:    Get her out of here.  I want a guard on her at all times.  ,6,17
MULDER:    Yeah. And we took him right where he wanted to go.  ,6,17
MULDER:    You think he's trying to tell us something?  ,6,17
"MULDER:    Scully, look at this.  I'm assuming Rawls wrote this with his finger just like the other one.  Look here.  ",6,17
"MULDER:    Or the mirror stopped him.  What makes an object solid, Scully? I mean, what, what prevents one solid object from passing through another solid object, usually?  ",6,17
MULDER:    Electrons. What if Rawls's ability somehow has to do electricity? What would preclude it or contain it?  ,6,17
MULDER:    Exactly. Rawls couldn't pass through this.  ,6,17
MULDER:    (considering)  It's not about the money.  It's never been about the money.  ,6,17
MULDER:    Pregnancy.  ,6,17
MULDER:    This is seven years ago.  That's just a few months after Rawls was sent to a prison farm.  ,6,17
MULDER:    Where are they headed?  ,6,17
"MULDER:    Yeah, we got to get there first.  ",6,17
MULDER:    (to the TROOPER)   I'm going to need some equipment.  Special issue.  ,6,17
"MULDER:   (on phone)   It was a live birth-- that's all you can tell me? Yeah, can you check on that, please?  ",6,17
MULDER:    Yes. Thank you.  ,6,17
MULDER:    (showing her bullets)   Riot slugs--  rubber.  (into phone) Uh-huh.  Yeah.   No.    Thank you.  (hangs up)   It's a boy.  That's all I got.  ,6,17
"MULDER:    No official files.  No adoption records,  no records of foster care in Alabama,  Mississippi, Louisiana, nothing.  ",6,17
"MULDER:    (on answering machine)   Jackie, this is Agent Mulder  ",6,17
"MULDER:    Get him out of here, Scully.  ",6,17
MULDER:    Don't make me shoot you.  Don't make me shoot you.  ,6,17
MULDER:    Maybe another chance.  ,6,17
"MULDER:    Mmm, sorry about that.  Come on in.  ",6,18
MULDER:    Hmm... Young guy?  ,6,18
MULDER:    New neighbor. Why?  ,6,18
"MULDER:    Uh, briefly, yeah.  He's a writer.  ",6,18
"MULDER:    He didn't say.  SCULLY:    These are, uh... these are my autopsy reports from the second victim.  ",6,18
MULDER:    No indication of how the killer did it?  ,6,18
"MULDER:    And yet, you still refuse to believe my theory-- that what this is psychic surgery?  ",6,18
MULDER:    Or  it's a grossly misunderstood area of alternative medicine.  ,6,18
"MULDER:    Well, absent another theory how else do we account for the impossible extraction of this man's heart?  ",6,18
"MULDER:    I mean, we have no evidence-- no MO to speak of. This could be the perfect crime.  ",6,18
"MULDER:   (on phone)   Hey, Scully, glad I caught you. We got a third victim-- 16-year- old kid out on lover's lane.  ",6,18
"MULDER:   (on phone)   Yeah. I'm sure many a person's had their heart broken out here, but not quite like this.  I was hoping you'd be here to explain it in medical terms to the local PD.  ",6,18
"MULDER:   (on phone)   No, nothing. I mean, it's like there's nowhere to start on this case. Nothing to ask nothing to say.  ",6,18
"MULDER:   (on phone)   So far, there's absolutely nothing, Scully. It appears to be just a series of random attacks.  ",6,18
MULDER:   (on phone)   Yeah? From who?  ,6,18
MULDER:    It came here for me?  ,6,18
"MULDER:    (flipping it in the air and catching it)   I don't think it's the killer, Scully.  ",6,18
MULDER:    (sitting at the desk)   I see it has a burning heart. But we're dealing with a killer that leaves absolutely no clues. Why would he do something as heavy-handed as this?  ,6,18
MULDER:    Maybe it's not me at all.  Maybe he sent it to you. Maybe it's a secret admirer.  ,6,18
"MULDER:    Actually, let me.  You've got a 9:00 a.m. with the DC medical examiner.  He's going to let you autopsy the latest victim.  ",6,18
"MULDER:    (gentle rebuke)  Hey, you weren't joking about being late. I was about to start slicing and dicing, myself.  ",6,18
MULDER:    Where were you?  ,6,18
MULDER:    For what?  ,6,18
"MULDER:    No, I think I was wrong.  I think it's very significant.  I think it may be a communication from the killer. Most of my research shows that most credible practitioners of psychic surgery believe themselves to be imbued with the Holy Spirit-- that their hands become the miracle tools of God.  ",6,18
"MULDER:    Who, the writer?  ",6,18
MULDER:    You're kidding.  ,6,18
MULDER:    Is  he our killer?  ,6,18
MULDER:    I'm sorry I forgot your name.  ,6,18
MULDER:    (as if remembering)   Padgett.  ,6,18
MULDER:    You're a writer.  Anything I'd know?  ,6,18
MULDER:    A murder case.  ,6,18
MULDER:    Possibly.  ,6,18
MULDER:    Mr. Popularity.  ,6,18
MULDER:    Scully.  ,6,18
MULDER:    You all right?  ,6,18
MULDER:    Putting this man under arrest.  ,6,18
"MULDER:    Yeah, it's how you found your victims-- in the personals. They all took out personal ads.  ",6,18
MULDER:    And you targeted them.  ,6,18
"MULDER:    No, you targeted...  ",6,18
MULDER:    Then this is your confession?  ,6,18
"MULDER:    It's all in there-- every detail, every murder, all laid out. How'd you do it, Mr. Padgett?  ",6,18
MULDER:    The murders.  ,6,18
"MULDER:    How about ""the stranger""?  Is that you?  How about Ken Naciamento?  ",6,18
MULDER:    Is that your accomplice?  ,6,18
MULDER:    Did you direct him to do it?  ,6,18
MULDER:    (glancing at SCULLY)   Which is the truth?  ,6,18
"MULDER:   Why, Mr. Padgett?  Maybe that's a question you can answer.  ",6,18
MULDER:    Maybe if it were fiction.  ,6,18
"MULDER:    To find his accomplice, the Brazilian psychic surgeon.  ",6,18
MULDER:    Where is he now?  ,6,18
MULDER:    He can't be.  ,6,18
MULDER:    Padgett couldn't have done this alone.  ,6,18
"MULDER:    Scully, it's all on the page.  How else would he know it?  ",6,18
MULDER:    No one can predict human behavior.  No one can tell you what another person's going to do.  ,6,18
"MULDER:    If he imagines it, it's a priori-- before the fact. I think that's pretty clear from what he wrote about you.  ",6,18
"MULDER:    You know you're in here, don't you?  ",6,18
"MULDER:    (quietly)   Well, let's just say it ends with you doing the naked pretzel with ""the stranger"" on a bed in an unfurnished fourth floor apartment.  (pause)   I'm assuming that's a priori, too?  ",6,18
"MULDER:    Mmmm.  (after another pause)   Well, you might want to finish it.  ",6,18
MULDER:    No signs of a possible struggle at the grave site but the area's been so trammeled by the funeral that collecting evidence is going to be virtually impossible.  I think this is a big jerk off.  ,6,18
MULDER:    The only thing that he imagined was us out here...  ,6,18
MULDER:    ...looking like idiots.  ,6,18
MULDER:    Hands where I can see 'em!  Don't move until I tell you! I'm a federal agent.  ,6,18
"MULDER:    (still holding his gun on the CEMETERY WORKER) The truck. Check the truck, Scully.  ",6,18
"MULDER:   (putting a finger to his forehead, Karnac-style)   I imagined it.  ",6,18
"MULDER:    What do you need, a signed work order? Of course he directed him.  ",6,18
"MULDER:    You're about to argue my usual side, aren't you?  ",6,18
MULDER:    You read his book.   You read what he wrote about you. Are you trying to tell me that he got inside your head?  That what I read is true?  ,6,18
MULDER:    I don't know how they communicate.  This is the only way I can think to catch him.  ,6,18
"MULDER:    (apologetically, handing over the plastic wrapped manuscript) Mr. Padgett... you can go. We apologize for our mistake.  You're free to finish your book.  ",6,18
"MULDER:    What's that, Mr. Padgett?  ",6,18
MULDER:    Anything?  ,6,18
MULDER:    What's he up to now?  ,6,18
MULDER:    Now what?  (climbs up to the camera and adjusts it to another view of the room)  Anything?  ,6,18
MULDER:    Padgett!  Freeze.  Step away from the incinerator.  ,6,18
MULDER:    What do you think you're doing?  ,6,18
"MULDER:    Destroying evidence, you mean.  Let me see what you wrote.  ",6,18
MULDER:    You came down here to give these instructions to your accomplice?  ,6,18
MULDER:    When?  ,6,18
MULDER:    You were alone up there.  ,6,18
"MULDER'S VOICE:    (oc) Hey, Scully, it's me.  ",6,19
"MULDER'S VOICE:    (oc) 2:34AM. (beat)   Listen, Scully, I need you on the next flight to Las Vegas.  ",6,19
MULDER'S VOICE:    (oc) It's the Lone Gunmen.  They're onto something big.  ,6,19
MULDER'S VOICE:    It's really important.  Trust me.  ,6,19
"MULDER'S VOICE:    Look, I can't talk over an unsecured line. Please just get here.  It's an emergency.  ",6,19
"MULDER:    (still looking at the record book)   I have seen the life on this planet, Scully and that is exactly why I am looking elsewhere.  ",6,20
MULDER:    Did you bring enough ice cream to share with the rest of the class?  ,6,20
"MULDER:    (returning to his book)   Ugh. Bet the air in my mouth tastes better than that.  You sure know how to live it up, Scully.  ",6,20
"MULDER:    Looking for anomalies, Scully.  Do you know how many so-called ""flying disc"" reports there were in New Mexico in the 1940s?  ",6,20
"MULDER:    No, I won't sit idly by as you hurl cliches at me.  Preparation is the father of inspiration.  ",6,20
MULDER:    The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom.  ,6,20
"MULDER:    I scream, you scream, we all scream for nonfat tofutti rice dreamsicles.  ",6,20
"MULDER:    Reading the box scores, Scully. You'd like it. It's like the Pythagorean Theorem for jocks.  It distills all the chaos and action of any game in the history of all baseball games into one tiny, perfect, rectangular sequence of numbers.  I can look at this box and I can recreate exactly what happened on some sunny summer day back in 1947.  It's like the numbers talk to me, they comfort me.  They tell me that even though lots of things can change some things do remain the same. It's...  ",6,20
MULDER:    Of course not.  ,6,20
MULDER:    (to himself)  Is that Arthur... Dales...  ,6,20
MULDER:    (fake)   Ah... Choo!  ,6,20
"MULDER:    I'm-I'm sorry, sir, I'm-I'm looking for Arthur Dales.  ",6,20
"MULDER:    No, you're not.  ",6,20
"MULDER:    No, I-I'm sorry, sir, I know Arthur Dales and you're not Arthur Dales.  ",6,20
MULDER:    How do you know my name?  ,6,20
"MULDER:    Mr. Dales, I have a, uh... I have a photo here of your brother. Maybe it's you.  It's from many years ago and you're, you're standing in Roswell, New Mexico.  ",6,20
"MULDER:    Okay, and you're standing with Negro League legend Josh Exley who disappeared without a trace during a season in which he reportedly hit 60 home runs.  ",6,20
MULDER:    61 home runs in 1948.  ,6,20
"MULDER:    '47, whatever. I don't really care about the baseball, so much, sir.  What I care about is this man in the picture with you.  I believe to be an alien bounty hunter.  ",6,20
MULDER:    Wait a minute. I like baseball.  ,6,20
MULDER:    Yeah.  ,6,20
MULDER:    (thinks)   A hundred and sixty-three.  ,6,20
MULDER:    Righty.  373 lefty.  536 total.  ,6,20
"MULDER:    Yes, sir, that may be true.  I'm thinking that your experience in Roswell could be germane to a conspiracy between men in our government and these shape-shifting alien beings.  ",6,20
MULDER:    (soft laugh)   I guess... women change men all the time.  ,6,20
MULDER:    What exactly has your brother told you about me?  ,6,20
"MULDER:    Mr. Dales, if you and your brother have really known about this bounty hunter and plans for colonization for the last 50 years why the hell wouldn't you have told anybody?  ",6,20
MULDER:    I would have believed you.  ,6,20
MULDER:    (standing)   Not ripe?  LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING:  I have been ripe for years.  I am way past ripe.  I'm so ripe I'm rotten.  This cuts to the very heart of the mystery of what I've been doing with my life for the past ten years.  ,6,20
MULDER:    What is this?  ,6,20
MULDER:    (putting a dime in the toy)  You're making me feel like a child.  ,6,20
"MULDER:    I've got to give it to you, Arthur.  Calling a Negro league team from Roswell the Grays is pretty clever.  E.T. steal home.  E.T. steal home.  ",6,20
"MULDER:    You seriously want me to believe that Josh Exley maybe one of the greatest ballplayers of all times, was an alien?  ",6,20
MULDER:    (not believing)   Babe Ruth was an alien?  ,6,20
MULDER:    (eating the hotdog)   Joe DiMaggio?  ,6,20
MULDER:    Willie Mays?  ,6,20
MULDER:    Mantle? Koufax? Gibson?  ,6,20
MULDER:    (reaching into his pocket)  So I assume you're speaking metaphorically?  ,6,20
"MULDER:  Let me get this straight: a free-spirited alien fell in love with baseball and ran away from the other non-fun-having aliens and made himself black, because that would prevent him from getting to the majors where his unspeakable secret might be discovered by an intrusive press and public and you're also implying that...  ",6,20
"MULDER:    You're also implying that this baseball-playing alien has something to do with the famous Roswell UFO crash of July '47, aren't you?  ",6,20
"MULDER:    (after a pause)  Drift it is, sir.  ",6,20
"MULDER:    Okay, so was Ex a man who was metaphorically an alien or an alien who was metaphorically a man or a something in between that was literally an alien-human hybrid?  ",6,20
MULDER:    It's official.  I am a horse's ass.  ,6,20
"MULDER:    Well, I have noticed over the course of time, a man and his dog will often start to look like one another.  ",6,20
"MULDER:    You've never hit a baseball, have you, Scully?  ",6,20
"MULDER:   Get over here, Scully.  ",6,20
MULDER:    This ain't cheap.  I'm paying that kid ten bucks an hour to shag balls.  ,6,20
"MULDER:    Hey, it's not a bad piece of ash, huh?  ",6,20
"MULDER:    The bat-talking about the bat.  Now, don't strangle it. You just want to shake hands with it. ""Hello, Mr. Bat. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.""  ""Oh, no, no, Ms. Scully. The pleasure's all mine.""  ",6,20
"MULDER:    Okay, now, we want to... we want to go hips before hands, okay? (holds his hand a few inches from her hip)  We want to stride forward and turn.  That's all we're thinking about.  So, we go hips... before hands, all right?  ",6,20
MULDER:    One more time.  ,6,20
"MULDER:    Hips... before hands, all right?  ",6,20
MULDER:    What is it?  ,6,20
"MULDER:    (speaking right into her ear)   Right. We're going to wait on the pitch.  We're going to keep our eye on the ball. Then, we're just going to make contact.  We're not going to think.  We're just going to let it fly, Scully, okay?  ",6,20
MULDER:    Ready?  ,6,20
"MULDER:    All right, fire away, Poorboy.  ",6,20
"MULDER:    Ooh! That's good.  All right, what you may find is you concentrate on hitting that little ball... The rest of the world just fades away-- all your everyday, nagging concerns.  ",6,20
MULDER:    The ticking of your biological clock.  ,6,20
"MULDER:    How you probably couldn't afford that nice, new suede coat on a G-Woman's salary.  ",6,20
"MULDER:    How you threw away a promising career in medicine... (intimately into her ear)  to hunt aliens with a crackpot, albeit  brilliant, partner.  ",6,20
"MULDER:    Getting into the heart of a global conspiracy.  Your obscenely overdue triple-X bill.  Oh, I... I'm sorry, Scully.  Those last two problems are mine, not yours.  ",6,20
"MULDER:    Oh. Ugh.  I don't know what they did with the screen for this thing.  Now, this is Angela and Wallace Schiff.  It's a young married couple last seen hiking in the vicinity of Brown Mountain, North Carolina.  That's Angie on the right.  I should add that this is the condition in which their bodies were  found after being missing for only three days... in temperatures that never got above 70 degrees.  ",6,21
MULDER:    (suggestively)   Not to mention that these skeletons are not wearing any clothes.  ,6,21
"MULDER:    That's a pretty big operation you're describing.  There was no evidence found at the scene-- no tire tracks, no footprints, nothing.  ",6,21
"MULDER:    It's Brown Mountain, Scully.  That doesn't ring a bell?  (SCULLY shakes her head.)  The Brown Mountain lights?  It's a famous atmospheric phenomenon dating back nearly 700 years witnessed by thousands of people-- back to the Cherokee Indians.  Strange multicolored lights are seen to dance above the peak of the mountain. There's been no geological explanation, no scientific credible explanation at all.  ",6,21
"MULDER:    (modestly)   As I said, there's been no scientific credible explanation but there are those of us who believe these strange multicolored lights are really...  ",6,21
"MULDER:    (hurt)   Sounds like crap when you say it.  I'm just wondering if there's a connection, Scully.  I mean, the conditions of these bodies are reminiscent of certain southwestern cattle mutilations.  Those are cases where there's no physical evidence and they've long been associated with UFO activity.  ",6,21
"MULDER:    Scully, in six years, how... how often have I been wrong?  (SCULLY scoffs.)  No, seriously.  I mean, every time I bring you a case we go through this perfunctory dance. You tell me I'm not being scientifically rigorous and that I'm off my nut, and then in the end who turns out to be right like 98.9% of the time?  I just think I've... earned the benefit of the doubt here.  ",6,21
MULDER:    We appreciate you holding off.  ,6,21
"MULDER:    Hmm.  And they were both found near Brown Mountain, right?  Where exactly?  ",6,21
"MULDER:    I'm going to check out where the bodies were found.  (Heads for the door, then realizes SCULLY is not following.)   You coming?  ",6,21
MULDER:    Wallace Schiff?  ,6,21
MULDER: Wallace Schiff?  ,6,21
MULDER:    Hello!  ,6,21
"MULDER:    Then, come out here.  Step closer.  I won't hurt you.  ",6,21
"MULDER:    One of who?  Are you Wallace Schiff?  Well, I hate to tell you this, Wallace, but you're supposed to be dead.  They found your skeleton not 200 yards from here.  ",6,21
MULDER:    Who put it there?  ,6,21
MULDER:    The Brown Mountain lights.  ,6,21
"MULDER:    Wallace... Wallace?  They found your wife Angela, too... lying right alongside your skeleton.  ",6,21
MULDER:    First things first-- we got to find a way out of here.  ,6,21
MULDER:    What the hell's going on?  That was solid rock a minute ago.  Now there's nothing there.  ,6,21
"MULDER:    Wallace, let's get out of here.  Come on, Wallace.  ",6,21
MULDER:    (whisper)   Wallace!  ,6,21
MULDER:    They're gone.  ,6,21
MULDER:    They should have.  Maybe they came for something else.  ,6,21
"MULDER:    Angie, can you talk to me?  Do you remember what happened?  Can you tell me?  ",6,21
MULDER:    You were with your husband.  With Wallace.  ,6,21
MULDER:    Where was that light coming from?  From the mountain?  ,6,21
MULDER:    And then what happened?  ,6,21
MULDER:    This... this place that they took you to can you describe it to me tell me what it looked like?  ,6,21
MULDER:    Were there men there?  ,6,21
MULDER:    Did they perform tests on you?  ,6,21
"MULDER:    You have a, uh... you have a scar back here on the back of your neck.  ",6,21
MULDER:    It's fresh.  ,6,21
MULDER:    It's an implant.  I've seen this before.  ,6,21
"MULDER:    No, male abductees don't usually report this.  And everything she says so far is textbook down to the last detail, except for one.  ",6,21
MULDER:    Two skeletons we found were identified as yours and Angie's?  I don't understand that.  It doesn't make sense to me.  ,6,21
MULDER:    I had that thought but there's no precedent for it.  It's in none of the literature.  ,6,21
MULDER:    We got to get out of here right now.  ,6,21
"MULDER:    We're leaving now.  Gather your things.  Angie, I'll help you up.  ",6,21
MULDER:    No!  ,6,21
MULDER:    Scully...  ,6,21
MULDER:    Long story.  ,6,21
MULDER:    I'm sorry.   Does anybody know you're here?  ,6,21
"MULDER:    Scully, this is...  ",6,21
"MULDER:    This is my partner, Agent Scully.  ",6,21
"MULDER:    Yeah, I think you were meant to.  ",6,21
"MULDER:    Scully, I want you to... put aside your scientific bias for a moment.  'Cause what I'm about to tell you is going to change your life forever.  Your life, my life the life of everybody on this planet.  ",6,21
MULDER:    (proudly and in awe)  I was out there... and I found it.  ,6,21
MULDER:    The truth.  This couple... they were abducted by a UFO-- the Brown Mountain lights.  ,6,21
MULDER:    (to SCULLY very softly)   Just like what happened to you.  ,6,21
MULDER:    There's more.  ,6,21
MULDER:    It doesn't like the light.  ,6,21
MULDER:    (smiling)   I abducted him.  It's a gray.  It speaks to me.  We communicate telepathically.  He told me everything.  ,6,21
MULDER:    Yeah.  ,6,21
MULDER:    (pleased)   You think so?  ,6,21
MULDER:    What about the skeletons?  ,6,21
MULDER:    (thoughtful)   You're buying that decoy theory?  What about that organic substance we found on the skeletons?  That goo you were so interested in?  ,6,21
"MULDER:    That, uh... doesn't sound like you, Scully.  It, uh... God, I can't believe you're buying this.  ",6,21
"MULDER:    Uh, this doesn't make any sense.  ",6,21
MULDER:    These two.  Their story.  Their skeletons.  None of it.  ,6,21
MULDER:    Scully.  ,6,21
"MULDER:    We were in the cave when the light came.  It was a blinding blue-white light.  Then they took me.  I was abducted.  I found myself in some kind of medical bay.  It was white, featureless.  It was just as the Schiffs had described it.  ",6,21
"MULDER:    No, actually, they're not.  ",6,21
MULDER:    Look at me.  I'm here.  ,6,21
MULDER:    Aliens brought me back here.  ,6,21
MULDER:    It doesn't change what happened.  ,6,21
"MULDER:    Well, what can I say, Scully?  I'm here. I'm real.  ",6,21
MULDER:    Brought on by what?  ,6,21
MULDER:    Whatever happened to the most logical explanation?  ,6,21
"MULDER:    (rubbing his face)  Whoa, Scully.  ",6,21
MULDER:    A giant mushroom?  ,6,21
MULDER:    To lure its prey into the cave?  ,6,21
MULDER:    We've contacted Fish and Wildlife.  We've contacted the North Carolina State Health Department as well as the local FBI field office in Raleigh.  And we've contacted a mycologist at the Smithsonian for good measure.  We think we have our bases covered.  ,6,21
MULDER:    I'm just thinking... I'm not exactly clear on how we escaped.  ,6,21
MULDER:    (to SCULLY)   Once you recognized that we were under a chemical influence then it simply kind of... broke its spell?  ,6,21
"MULDER:    Scully, how could we simply will ourselves out of a chemical hallucination?  ",6,21
MULDER:    Did we?  Can you name me one drug that loses its effect once the user realizes it's in his system?  ,6,21
"MULDER:    Scully, how long were we underground?  Hours?  Half a day?  How come our bodies don't show any effects of being burned by the digestive fluids?  We were covered in hydrochloric acid.  Yet look at our skin. Nothing.  ",6,21
MULDER:    Scully... we never escaped.  We're still trapped underground.  ,6,21
"MULDER:    No, I'm not.  This is not real.  (to SKINNER)   You, you're not real.  ",6,21
"MULDER:    I'll prove it, Scully.  ",6,21
"MULDER:    Both men espouse a fringe theory called ""Panspermia.""  It's the belief that life originated...  ",6,22
"MULDER:    Dr. Sandoz, the man he'd come to meet made a similar claim in a  (pointedly to SCULLY)   ""science"" ...  journal.  He said he'd found an artifact that was almost identical to that with similar writings on it.  ",6,22
"MULDER:    Well, we'd have to ask Dr. Sandoz that.  ",6,22
MULDER:    We can't. He's missing.  ,6,22
MULDER:    Skinner wants us on the case.  ,6,22
MULDER:    I am just a hired gun for the FBI.  ,6,22
MULDER:    What if there's something to this?  ,6,22
MULDER:    That's what we're being asked to figure out.  ,6,22
MULDER:    (softly)   No.  ,6,22
MULDER:    (confused)   No... I couldn't hear it.  ,6,22
MULDER:    My sister.  ,6,22
MULDER:    Fox Mulder with the FBI.  ,6,22
MULDER:    Any ideas yourself about what happened here?  ,6,22
MULDER:    About the missing Dr. Sandoz?  ,6,22
"MULDER:    I don't know.  It's, uh... a hollow noise.  The same thing that happened to me at work in the elevator this morning.  ",6,22
MULDER:    No.  This is going to sound weird but I think it's that thing.  ,6,22
MULDER:    I'm sorry.  I thought this was my office.  ,6,22
"MULDER:    You don't believe it, Chuck?  ",6,22
MULDER:    Noise.  Aural dissonance.  It comes and it goes.  ,6,22
"MULDER:    No, but it was a few minutes ago.  ",6,22
MULDER:    Why?  ,6,22
MULDER:    Suspicious of what?  ,6,22
MULDER:    Yeah. It has to do with the occult.  ,6,22
MULDER:    That's what this thing is?  ,6,22
MULDER:    How do you know that?  ,6,22
MULDER:    Does he back any of that up?  ,6,22
"MULDER:    Yeah, but wouldn't it be in his great interest to hide something that he couldn't disprove with his scholarship?  ",6,22
"MULDER:    In 1996, a rock from Mars was found in Antarctica.  How did it get there?  ",6,22
MULDER:    Hmm.  ,6,22
"MULDER:    No, no, it's going away.  ",6,22
"MULDER:    No, I'm okay. I really am.  ",6,22
"MULDER:    I'm not going home to bed, Scully.  I think I know what's causing this and I know what happened to those two professors and that artifact.  I got a sense of it yesterday when I met that man Barnes.  ",6,22
MULDER:    Yes.  This man Solomon Merkmallen is dead.  Barnes knows it.  He killed him-- killed him in that lab.  ,6,22
"MULDER:    No, I'm not... not until after I show you what he did with the body.  ",6,22
MULDER:    We'll let you know if we find it.  ,6,22
"MULDER:    Whatever happened to Dr. Sandoz, he certainly liked to fly south for the winter--  a lot.  Gallup, New Mexico.  It's Navaho country.  ",6,22
MULDER:    That's Albert Hosteen.  ,6,22
MULDER:    Maybe he was using him to read the symbols on the artifact.  ,6,22
"MULDER:    Scully, you packing any latex?  ",6,22
MULDER:    Doesn't it smell like somebody forgot to take out the garbage?  ,6,22
MULDER:    He's afraid for his life because of what he knows and what he has..  ,6,22
"MULDER:    A genuine artifact-- one of several pieces of an unknown whole. Dr. Barnes has one now, too.  That's why he killed Solomon Merkmallen.  ",6,22
"MULDER:     was to incriminate Sandoz, to make him look like the killer. It's also to hide something.  Something that no one would think to look for. (losing focus)  Scully, could you please tell... what your medical exam found in the lab report?  ",6,22
MULDER:    All of which would retain telltale traces of radiation.  ,6,22
MULDER:    The artifact.  ,6,22
MULDER:    Cosmic Galactic Radiation.  It's a kind of radiation that's found only outside our solar system.  ,6,22
"MULDER:    Oh, forget the arrest.  We got to find these artifacts.  ",6,22
"MULDER:    Is there someone else on this case, sir?  ",6,22
MULDER:    (accusing)   There's someone else on this case-- you're not telling me.  ,6,22
MULDER:    I hear it... in my head.  ,6,22
"MULDER:    No, I'm not.  Listen to me-- he's not telling the truth.  I'm hearing people.  He's spying on us.  ",6,22
MULDER:    I need to find those artifacts.  ,6,22
"MULDER:   (on phone, sighs)   Hello?  ",6,22
MULDER:   (on phone)   I'm here. I'm resting.  ,6,22
MULDER:   (on phone)   I'm home.  It's okay. Where are you?  ,6,22
MULDER:   (on phone)   Does he have the artifact?  ,6,22
MULDER:   (on phone)   What?  ,6,22
"MULDER:   (on phone)   Scully, that artifact is extraterrestrial.  ",6,22
MULDER:   (on phone)   Did you know what that would mean?  ,6,22
"MULDER:   (on phone)   No, it would mean that our progenitors were alien, that our genesis was alien, that we're here because of them; that they put us here.  ",6,22
"MULDER:   (on phone)   You're wrong.  It holds everything.  Don't you see? All the mysteries of science everything we can't understand or won't explain, every human behaviorism-  cosmology, psychology, everything in the X-Files-- it all owes to them.  It's from them.  ",6,22
"MULDER:   (on phone)   Well, then, you go ahead and prove me wrong, Scully.  ",6,22
"MULDER:    Yeah, we'll have it our way.  ",7,1
MULDER:    We're investigating a murder.  A car was found in a reservoir ten miles from here.  A body was found in the trunk of that car.  ,7,1
"MULDER:    Yeah, long day.  So let's make this quick. Does everybody have their button?  ",7,1
"MULDER:    Yeah, but does everybody have their button?  ",7,1
"MULDER:    Hey, uh, you... back there, what's your name?  ",7,1
"MULDER:    Derwood. Do you have your button, Derwood?  ",7,1
MULDER:    We're going to ask everybody to step outside right now while we take a quick look around the premises.  ,7,1
MULDER:    His name was Donald Edward Pankow.  Does that ring a bell?  ,7,1
"MULDER:    Hey, Scully, check it out.  You know how they say you never want to see the kitchen of any of your favorite restaurants?  ",7,1
MULDER:    My point being that this is a hell of a lot cleaner than all the others.  Don't you think?  ,7,1
MULDER:    Maybe. Maybe I'm thinking this was the crime scene.  ,7,1
MULDER:    It had to happen somewhere.  ,7,1
MULDER:    I wouldn't exactly call it surgery. What if this man's brain was eaten?  ,7,1
MULDER:    I-it's not sociologically unheard of.  There are certain tribes in New Guinea that consider human brains a delicacy.  ,7,1
"MULDER:    Yeah, what's your point?  ",7,1
MULDER:    It's just that nothing about the way the body was dumped suggests a fetishistic killing.  The brain wasn't removed intact.  What if this man's brain was eaten right out of his skull?  ,7,1
"MULDER:    Well, maybe it was cut. Maybe it was punched.  What look like tool marks to you look to me like something more organic.  Like it was made by a...  a tongue or a proboscis.  ",7,1
MULDER:    I don't know.  ,7,1
MULDER:    Oh. Hello.  Look at this.  Does that look like blood to you?  ,7,1
"MULDER:    What is that?  Next to it.  Is that, uh... oh, my... ugh. Is that brain?  Is that brain matter there?  ",7,1
MULDER:    Ground beef.  ,7,1
MULDER:    Rob Roberts?  (voice)  It's Agent Mulder.  ,7,1
"MULDER:    Hello, again.  Sorry to bother you at home.  ",7,1
MULDER:    (walking in)   Can I come in?  ,7,1
"MULDER:    Great, great.  ",7,1
MULDER:    You live here alone?  ,7,1
MULDER:    Uh-huh.   Mom or girlfriend?  ,7,1
"MULDER:    Come on, man, who cleans up after you?  ",7,1
"MULDER:    Well, bravo. You know, they say single guys are just bears who own furniture, (smiles)  but... I mean, my place...  Oh, but here... you can smell the Pine-Sol.  ",7,1
"MULDER:    Yeah, a cheeseburger and a large order of fries.  (smiles) Heh. It's a bad joke.  I'm sorry.  (pulls out notebook)   Um... Mr. Rice, your manager?  He told me that, uh... you stayed late on Friday? Is that right?  ",7,1
"MULDER:    Yeah, did you volunteer to close?  ",7,1
"MULDER:    Yeah, okay.  You volunteered.  ",7,1
"MULDER:    (making a note)   Volunteered...  um...  the, uh... the 35 pounds of ground chuck that Mr. Rice told you to throw away.  What did you do with that?  ",7,1
MULDER:    Where?  ,7,1
"MULDER:    Hmm.  That's weird.  Because that's what I figured you did, so I checked the dumpster and it was empty, which is weird because it only gets cleaned out on Thursday and you would have thrown away the meat on Friday so you'd expect the meat to be there, right?  ",7,1
MULDER:    I don't see how that's relevant to this murder case anyway. Let me see if there's anything else I wanted to ask you.  ,7,1
"MULDER:    Blood.  (ROB whips his head back to MULDER) You're, you're bleeding.  (points to ROB's bleeding lip.)  ",7,1
MULDER:    Mmm.  I think that just about wraps it up for me here.  ,7,1
"MULDER:    Yeah. No, I already got a pretty good idea who it is.  Thanks.  ",7,1
"MULDER:    (casually, Columbo style)  Hey, just the man I wanted to see. How are you this morning, Rob?  ",7,1
"MULDER:    I'm glad I caught you.  Oh, hey, I was just driving to your apartment and I saw Derwood Spinks not a block from here.  He wasn't coming from your place by any chance, was he?  ",7,1
MULDER:    Good. I'd stay away from him.  He's our prime suspect in the Pankow murder.  ,7,1
"MULDER:    Me? No. No, I should say that's the opinion of the Costa Mesa police.  (he winks.)   And my partner.  ",7,1
"MULDER:    No, I think we're looking for somebody who has a compulsion to kill... Who truly can't help himself.  Oh, quick question: the, uh... the meat that you threw in the dumpster.  ",7,1
MULDER:    The dumpster had a padlock.  ,7,1
MULDER:    Who would have the key?  ,7,1
MULDER:    (enigmatically)    I'm just tying up some loose ends.  ,7,1
"MULDER:    Afternoon, Rob.  ",7,1
MULDER:    His car is gone along with some personal belongings.  ,7,1
MULDER:    Who said he left town?  ,7,1
"MULDER:    No, no, no.  Personally, I think he's dead.  I can't speak for my partner but I think that whatever it was that killed Donald Pankow also got to Mr. Derwood Spinks.  ",7,1
"MULDER:    I'll let you in on a little secret.  (He gets up from the edge of the table he was seated on and crouches by ROB.)   We've been able to keep it pretty quiet up until now but Donald Pankow's brain was missing from his skull.  My partner was able to find something that was previously undetected. It was the tip of what can only be described as a tiny shark's tooth embedded deep in the bone.  I think we're looking for some kind of genetic freak-- a carnivorous predator as yet unidentified.  A monster, if you will.  ",7,1
MULDER:    Don't you believe it.  This thing definitely qualifies.  It has a biological imperative to eat.  I think it even ate that ground chuck you threw away.  ,7,1
MULDER:    Because it can't kill with impunity and it knows it.  It knows that the more it feeds on humans the closer it gets to getting caught but the hunger is always there.  And it satisfies it any way it can.  ,7,1
MULDER:    I think you know why.  ,7,1
MULDER:    Watch out for that monster.  ,7,1
"MULDER:    Mr. Derwood Spinks.  Alive and well.  (ROB nods. MULDER walks over and sits next to ROB on the couch.) I'm confused, Rob.  Was he helping you redecorate?  ",7,1
MULDER:    You must have been very scared.  ,7,1
MULDER:    Do you recognize this guy?  ,7,1
MULDER:    He's a private eye.  Sylvia Jassy's ex-husband hired him to spy on her.  But now this Steve Kiziak has gone missing.  ,7,1
"MULDER:    Well, maybe we should check with Sylvia again.  ",7,1
"MULDER:    Well, we'll track her down.  (He gets up to leave with SCULLY.  As he closes the door behind him, he says ...) Don't worry, Rob, it won't be long now.  ",7,1
"MULDER:    Step away, Rob.  Step away.  ",7,1
"MULDER:    Rob, we tracked Sylvia down on the way to the landfill. You just can't stop yourself, can you?  Get on the floor.  Rob, get on the floor.  ",7,1
"MULDER:   (on phone, voice)   Hello.  ",7,2
"MULDER:   (on phone, voice)   Are you in Chicago?  ",7,2
"MULDER:   (on phone)   Oh, around.  ",7,2
"MULDER:    (hanging up the phone)   Hey, nice outfit.  ",7,2
MULDER:    Before you check out down there check out up there. (points to the top of the tall building)  Top two floors are leased to one Jimmy Cutrona whose name you might be familiar with.  ,7,2
"MULDER:    Which is why last night there were two agents parked across the street in surveillance.  They witnessed a man being thrown from Cutrona's ROOF AT 10:40 p.m.  This man fell for 30 floors, plus the distance down this shaft, because these doors just happened to be open-- straight through, nothing but net.  ",7,2
"MULDER:    I'm guessing that's what he said.  After, he got up, climbed out of here and scampered off into the night.  ",7,2
"MULDER:    No idea.  He got away.  The agents gave chase, but no clear description.  ",7,2
"MULDER:    No.  Technically, falling 300 feet and surviving isn't a crime.  ",7,2
"MULDER:    What if this man had some kind of special capability?  Some kind of genetic predisposition towards rapid healing, or tissue regeneration?  ",7,2
MULDER:    What's your point?  ,7,2
"MULDER:    (affectionate sarcasm)  What if he got really, really lucky? That's your big scientific explanation, Scully?  (laughing as SCULLY flashes the light across his face)  I mean, how many thousands of variables would have to convene in just the right mixture for that theory to hold water?  ",7,2
"MULDER:    Well, thousands.  ",7,2
MULDER:    Yeah?  ,7,2
MULDER:    We'd have to find him to ask.  ,7,2
MULDER:    Looks like maybe we've found part of him already.  ,7,2
"MULDER:    Yeah, but only this one Henry Weems made an appointment this morning to get a new one.  ",7,2
"MULDER:    Come on, Scully.  I'm feeling lucky.  ",7,2
MULDER:    Your building super-- Henry Weems-- he isn't around?  ,7,2
MULDER:    I know that.   Clockwise.  ,7,2
"MULDER:    Yeah, it's all right.  My ass broke the fall.  Guess who I found. (to someone else in the room)  Henry Weems, I presume?  ",7,2
"MULDER:    Oh, uh... Oh, uh... You want to try this on for size, Cinderella?  ",7,2
"MULDER:    More to the point, you survived a, uh... 300-foot fall essentially un... harmed.  ",7,2
MULDER:    (unsympathetically):    Oh...  ,7,2
"MULDER:    Must have been a high-stakes game, I imagine.  Did you win a lot of money?  ",7,2
MULDER:    What is that?  Did you make it?  ,7,2
MULDER:    Mm-hmm.  Mind if I...?  ,7,2
MULDER:    (laughing)   Ah... That's craftsmanship.  What does it mean?  ,7,2
"MULDER:    Yeah, what's-what's...  ",7,2
MULDER:    It's cause and effect.  ,7,2
"MULDER:    Yeah, we can protect you.  ",7,2
"MULDER:    Come on, Scully, you're going to dump this case just as it's getting interesting.  ",7,2
MULDER:    Maybe his luck is the X-File.  ,7,2
MULDER:    Oh... Car keys.  Must have lost them when I fell.  ,7,2
"MULDER:    So, you get many of these?  ",7,2
"MULDER:    Our dead man's name is Angelo Bellini a.k.a. ""Angie the Animal."" He's an enforcer for the Cutrona family and I don't think his visit was friendly.  ",7,2
"MULDER:    Skinny guy with no depth perception against a man nicknamed ""The Animal""?  I don't think so.  You and I both know Weems didn't kill anybody. Besides, we were just gone for two minutes.  This guy doesn't have a scratch on him.  I'm thinking it was a heart attack.  ",7,2
MULDER:    Cause... and effect.  ,7,2
"MULDER:    Okay, so... watch.  (MULDER acts out the attack, interspersed with footage of the actual attack.)    So Bellini kicks down the door-- whaa gaa!-- poised to kill Weems, right?  And just as he's about to pull the trigger a noise startles him... the buzzer-- when I buzzed to be let back in the apartment. So when he does pull the trigger, his aim is off, right?  And he hits the lamp, which falls over and knocks over the ironing board, so as the bullet ricochets Weems dives over the sofa.  Now, when Bellini goes for him he trips over the ironing board, bounces off the chair, flips end over end and his shoelace gets caught in the fan-- QED.  ",7,2
MULDER: CAUSE AND EFFECT: seemingly unrelated and unconnected events and occurrences that appear unrelated and random beforehand but which seem to chain-react in Henry Weems' favor.  ,7,2
"MULDER:    Yeah, he seems to have tapped into it somehow.  He-he won big at poker; he-he survived getting thrown off a skyscraper...  and now this.  ",7,2
MULDER:    Okay.  ,7,2
MULDER:    Boy give you any leads?  ,7,2
MULDER:   Mm-hmm?  ,7,2
"MULDER:    Henry Weems has no police record, I assume?  ",7,2
"MULDER:    Ever since December, 1989.  (shows her a newspaper clipping) When a commuter jet crashed into Lake Michigan carrying 21 passengers. There was one survivor.  ",7,2
"MULDER:    Yeah. That's how he lost his eye.  Snowy night, Christmas rush. He'd been bumped from three previous flights before they finally found a seat for him on that fateful plane.  Guess what seat number.  ",7,2
MULDER:    On flight seven.  ,7,2
"MULDER:    Call it good or bad, but maybe that's where it all started. What if a brand-new Henry Weems was plucked from the wreckage? One whose fortunes had been irrevocably, permanently changed? Before 1989, Henry held down a job for nine years at the train yard but after the accident, as you said it's like he just disappeared off the face of the earth.  He severed ties with all his friends and moved out to Melrose Park.  ",7,2
MULDER:    What doesn't track for me is why he's resurfaced after all these years.  Why he's suddenly decided to use his luck in this way.  ,7,2
MULDER:    Maybe that's part of the package.   Can't have one without the other.  ,7,2
"MULDER:    Maybe it's like you said.  Why wouldn't the luckiest man in the world enter the lottery?   (they realize)   Actually, that's exactly what you said about an hour after you said it.  ",7,2
"MULDER:    He doesn't ""hide,"" he ""avoids.""  ",7,2
MULDER:    Henry Weems... you're a hard man to track down.  ,7,2
"MULDER:    Oh?  You and I are going to have a talk.  (MULDER pushes him into a chair.)   Just sit right here and don't move, okay?  ",7,2
MULDER:    (putting on his shirt)   Stings a bit.  But I'll live.  ,7,2
"MULDER:    Come over here, Henry.  I want to try something.  ",7,2
MULDER:    Nine of clubs.  You go.  ,7,2
MULDER:    I think you know.  ,7,2
"MULDER:    (faking surprise)   Uh, you win.  Double or nothing.  ",7,2
MULDER:    Whoo-hoo!  Tough to beat.  ,7,2
MULDER:    You win again.  ,7,2
"MULDER:    It proves that if we played this 10,000 times in a row he would win 10,000 times in a row.  He's incapable of losing.  How does it feel to be the luckiest man in the universe, Henry?  ",7,2
"MULDER:    No, no, I do, 'cause when you get lucky-- really, really lucky-- people around you tend to suffer.  Is that right?  ",7,2
"MULDER:    So you've stayed close to home mostly, kept a low profile but recently you've been venturing out a little further. You played poker with those mobsters.  ",7,2
MULDER:    You don't mind so much if a few criminals get hurt but then you went and you played the lottery.  ,7,2
MULDER:    For what?  ,7,2
MULDER:    No.  ,7,2
MULDER:    I'd agree with you if I thought his life was in danger.  ,7,2
"MULDER:    (voice)   As it is, he's doing a better job on Cutrona's organization than the FBI.  I'm wondering if we shouldn't make him an honorary agent.  ",7,2
"MULDER:    Come on, Scully.  ",7,2
MULDER:    Henry!  ,7,2
MULDER:    How's he doing?  ,7,2
MULDER:    Far from it.  Maybe what you said about streaks is right. It looks like his has just about run its course.  ,7,2
"MULDER:    And he's who we're focused on but there's no sign of a kidnapping, there's no ransom note.  ",7,2
MULDER:    Which makes it very hard for us to obtain a search warrant.  ,7,2
"MULDER:    Hold up, Henry.  Henry, what if what I said before wasn't true? That your luck hasn't changed?  Maybe all this is happening for a reason.  ",7,2
"MULDER:    No, I'm saying that what looks like it might be bad luck may not be bad luck, but we can't tell yet.  We're not in that position.  We can't see the forest for the trees.  ",7,2
MULDER:    How is he?  ,7,2
"MULDER:    Scully, what if everybody that becomes involved in Henry Weems' life somehow becomes an integral part of his luck, including you and I?  ",7,2
MULDER:    Looking for Maggie Lupone. (He lifts up a patient's chart and gets a phone book from the nurses' station.)   Luck is the overreaching force in this investigation.  I say we roll with it.  ,7,2
"MULDER:    Yeah, let's call that a dry run.  ",7,2
MULDER:    What are the odds for Cutrona being a perfect match? A thousand-to-one?  A million-to-one?  ,7,2
MULDER:    Maybe your luck is changing.  ,7,2
MULDER: Genuine artifact. ,7,3
"MULDER: Dr. Barnes has one now, too. That's why he killed Solomon Merkmallen. ",7,3
"MULDER: Sounds weird, but I think it's that thing. ",7,3
"MULDER: (voiceover) That would mean that our progenitors were alien, that our genesis was alien, that we're here because of them, that they put us here. And once you see all the mysteries of science, everything we can't understand or won't explain, everything in the X-Files, it all leads to them; it's from them. ",7,3
"MULDER: (gritting his teeth, in a raspy voice) They're coming.  ",7,3
MULDER: She knows. ,7,3
MULDER: Yeah. We got to act fast. ,7,3
MULDER: No doctors. Get me Scully. ,7,3
MULDER: Look... I know you've been compromised. I know Krycek is threatening your life... Blackmailing you. You don't think I can trust you but it's not you that I need. ,7,3
MULDER: Him. Kritschgau. Ask him to prove it. ,7,3
MULDER: What's causing this. ,7,3
MULDER: What's causing this is alien. That's why my doctors can't help me. ,7,3
MULDER: I do. That's why I need you.  ,7,3
MULDER: (half-hearted attempt at making a joke) Who ya gonna call? ,7,3
MULDER: Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. Now. ,7,3
MULDER: But I see them in my head. ,7,3
MULDER: You don't want to believe. You're not looking hard enough. ,7,3
MULDER: What's causing this? ,7,4
MULDER: What's causing this is alien. ,7,4
"MULDER: Look, I know you've been compromised. I know Krycek is threatening your life. ",7,4
"MULDER: (voice, not physically spoken, matter-of-factly) I can hear you, Mom. ",7,4
"MULDER: (voice, not understanding what is going on) Mom, I can hear you. I'm here. ",7,4
"MULDER: (voice) Mom, where you going? Mom! Mom! Come back, Mom! Mom! (he is yelling) Mom!! ( anguished screaming now) Mom!!! ",7,4
MULDER: (voice) I could always hear you. Even when my mind is jammed with a thousand voices I can hear you like a snake hissing underneath. How the hell did you get in here? ,7,4
MULDER: (voice) You've come to kill me. ,7,4
MULDER: What choice? ,7,4
"MULDER: I'm dying, you idiot. If I could get up, I'd kick your ass. ",7,4
MULDER: Wh... wh... what the hell are you doing to me? ,7,4
MULDER: Why should I take your hand? ,7,4
MULDER: (relief) No... I can't. All the voices are gone. ,7,4
MULDER: I'm not sure. ,7,4
MULDER: Why? ,7,4
MULDER: A man can't just disappear. ,7,4
"MULDER: (holding up his cuffed hands) Well, that'll be kind of tough with these on. ",7,4
MULDER: I feel better than I did. (sighs) I've got to tell Scully. I've got to tell her. ,7,4
MULDER: I don't smoke. ,7,4
MULDER: Where are we? ,7,4
MULDER: I don't understand. ,7,4
MULDER: Hello? Anybody home? ,7,4
MULDER: It can't be. ,7,4
MULDER: You're dead. ,7,4
"MULDER: Scully... saw you get shot... on the bridge six years ago. Sure, you're... dead. ",7,4
MULDER: I felt responsible for your death. ,7,4
MULDER: I thought that you died for my quest. ,7,4
MULDER: Hello. ,7,4
"MULDER: Hey, buddy, that's okay. You can build it again. Just start again. Okay? ",7,4
MULDER: Who's there? Who are you? ,7,4
MULDER: Morning. ,7,4
MULDER: (not sure about the situation) There's nothing wrong. Perfect. It's all perfect. What the hell am I doing here? ,7,4
"MULDER: No. I'm serious. I have commitments-- to the X-Files, to Scully, to my sister... ",7,4
"MULDER: (staring at her) ""Childish""? ",7,4
"MULDER: Wow... (sighs and laughs nervously) Diana, if... you lay all this on me after I sleep with you one time what's it going to be like tomorrow? ",7,4
MULDER: Just like that? I'm just supposed to slip into domestic bliss even after I was dropped off here by a man I have every reason to believe left here to carry on his dirty work. ,7,4
"MULDER: Yeah, including why you live in a bigger house than I do. ",7,4
MULDER: Diana? ,7,4
MULDER: Wow. What did you make? ,7,4
MULDER: Hey! What are... what are you doing? Why are you destroying your spaceship? ,7,4
"MULDER: We're the last, you and I. ",7,4
MULDER: (weakly) You... help... me. ,7,4
"MULDER: Scully, what are you doing here? Actually, I was just getting dressed to come see you but I... I couldn't find a tie to go with my victory cap. ",7,4
"MULDER: Oh, wait. Tie goes to the runner. ",7,4
"MULDER: Scully, I, um... I was coming down... to work to tell you that Albert Hosteen is dead. He died last night in New Mexico. He'd been in a coma for two weeks. There was... no way he could have been in your apartment. ",7,4
MULDER: Is it any more impossible than what you saw in Africa or what you saw in me? ,7,4
"MULDER: Scully, I was like you once-- I didn't know who to trust. Then I... I chose another path... another life, another fate, where I found my sister. The end of my world was unrecognizable and upside down. There was one thing that remained the same. ",7,4
"MULDER: You... were my friend, and you told me the truth. Even when the world was falling apart, you were my constant... my touchstone. ",7,4
MULDER:    Why? You hear any good ones lately?  ,7,5
"MULDER:    Merry Christmas, by the way, Scully.  ",7,5
"MULDER:    Grave robbery with a twist.  Check out the headliner, Scully.  ",7,5
"MULDER:    Indeed it does.  To answer your question -- no, I haven't been spreading any rumours.  The local PD's been doing a pretty good job of that ever since they matched the fingerprints of the dead man to these.  And to those up there on that headstone.  There's a big juicy handprint on the back.  (SCULLY looks.  Head stone for Raymond Crouch. Indeed there is a hand print.  MULDER climbs out of the grave.)  ",7,5
"MULDER:    Well, got one pile of dirt.  I'm guessing one man with a shovel. Other than that last night's rain hasn't left us much to go on.  Well, go ahead, Scully, naysay me.   The body of an FBI agent gets disinterred only to climb out on its own and disappear into the Yuletide night.  ",7,5
MULDER:    Did I?  ,7,5
MULDER:    Faked for what effect?  ,7,5
MULDER:    Looks like blood.  ,7,5
MULDER:    Should something stand out?  ,7,5
"MULDER:    Well, only that I don't think it was grave robbery per se. (Pause.  He and SCULLY both look down.  Here it comes.) It was necromancy.  ",7,5
"MULDER:    The summoning of the dead.  It's a form of magic dating back to primitive Shamanism with a long tradition in the Christian church. Through it, the dead are brought back to life for the purposes of divulging arcane knowledge or performing ritual tasks.  ",7,5
"MULDER:    No, that's what he was doing. (shows picture)   This is a, uh... that's a magic circle drawn in goat's blood.  The rain washed most of it away.  The blood attracts the spirits of the undead while the circle focuses the necromancer's power while protecting him from the spirits that he's conjuring.  ",7,5
MULDER:    He may also desire to wear the clothes of the dead man to create a bond between them.  You would not want to be this man's dry cleaner.  ,7,5
MULDER:    That is the question.  ,7,5
MULDER:    It's an ouroboros ... Possibly.   Definitely a mystical symbol. The alchemists favored it.  They believe that it represented all of existence.  ,7,5
"MULDER:    And that it was, in fact, a cult based upon Judeo-Christian ""Endtime"" prophecies concerning the coming millennium.  Was Raymond Crouch a member?  ",7,5
MULDER:    How long were you going to sit on this?  ,7,5
MULDER:    I think I know where to start.  ,7,5
"MULDER:    Only by reputation.  He left, um,  Vi-Cap before I got there. But he's been called the greatest criminal profiler that Quantico ever produced.  ",7,5
"MULDER:    (to the man)   Good morning.  (smiles as the actor playing the OLD MAN says something. Then turns back to SCULLY as they walk down the hall)   Apparently, he checked himself in for a 30 day observation. I gather the last few years haven't been very kind to him.  If there's anybody that can tell us about the Millennium Group, it's him. He used to consult for them.  Later, he fought to bring them down at the expense of his own career and reputation.  ",7,5
MULDER:    Yeah.  ,7,5
MULDER:    Frank Black?  ,7,5
"MULDER:    Hi, my name is, uh, Fox Mulder.  This is my partner, Dana Scully. It's a pleasure to meet you.  Do you mind if we sit down?  ",7,5
MULDER:    Who's playing?  ,7,5
"MULDER:    Ah, the Fighting Irish and the Golden Eagles, huh?  ",7,5
"MULDER:    Well, we're working on a case that, uh, we feel that you might have some particular insight into -- the deaths of four FBI agents. Do you recognize these men?  ",7,5
MULDER:    We're not asking you to get involved.  I'm just asking you to take a look at the case file.  ,7,5
"MULDER:    Mr. Black, the day after tomorrow is January 1, 2000. That's the significant date for these people.  That doesn't leave us much time. Don't you want to see them stopped?  ",7,5
"MULDER:    Well, Mr. Black, you are not what I was expecting.  ",7,5
MULDER:    Yes.  ,7,5
"MULDER:    (not happy)   It's third and ten.  It's third and ten, Notre Dame.  ",7,5
MULDER:   (really not happy)   Same to you.  ,7,5
"MULDER:    Our necromancer was definitely here.  (he rubs the white stuff between his gloved fingers, stands up and licks it)    It's salt.  Heavy magic.  ",7,5
MULDER:    And they were large enough to contain a body.  This is just a protective circle.  It's just big enough for one man to stand inside.  ,7,5
MULDER:    Whatever it was that did that.  ,7,5
MULDER:    Bite marks.  They look human.  ,7,5
"MULDER:    (reading)   ""I am he that liveth and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, amen;  And have the keys of hell and of death.""  ",7,5
MULDER:    Go Fighting Irish.  ,7,5
"MULDER:    First and 18.  It's not football,  it's Revelations.  You wanted to tell us something, Frank.  Why don't you just come out and say it?  ",7,5
"MULDER:    Right, so you'll occasionally drop the little arcane hint? A police officer was murdered, Frank.  Why do you want to play around? Your denial's a sign that you obviously know something about that. You knew that we'd find this.  What are you afraid of?  ",7,5
"MULDER:    But you obviously want to help.  You ... dropped that clue on us. Look, Frank, nobody needs to know about this.  We're just three people sitting around talking.  ",7,5
"MULDER:    With the express purpose of being brought back to life.  The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.  These four men bring with them war, pestilence, famine and death.  ",7,5
MULDER:    So is he a member of the Millennium Group as well?  ,7,5
MULDER:    So this is the one event that'll give his life meaning.  ,7,5
"MULDER:    These four members of the Millennium Group ... the ones that ""truly liveth who were dead.""  These are the ones we have to catch.  ",7,5
"MULDER:    He's not our murderer, and those four dead bodies aren't dead and the millennium is   (looks at his watch)   14 hours away.  ",7,5
"MULDER:    (slight smile)  Nobody likes a math geek, Scully.  ",7,5
"MULDER:    I do, too.  ",7,5
MULDER:    I absolutely think you should.  ,7,5
"MULDER:    Follow the profile.  The deputy was killed on a road that connects from the north with no major highway.  I'm thinking our necromancer lives nearby. I'm going to do a rundown on all single landowners in the area see where the bodies are buried, since we all ... Oh, Scully, will you do me a favor? Don't let anybody remove the staples from the deputy's mouth, okay? Please?  Just humor me.  Thanks.  ",7,5
MULDER:   Welcome to the boondocks.  ,7,5
MULDER:    (yelling)   Open the door!  Open the door!  Open it! Let me out!  Let me out!  ,7,5
MULDER:    (scared)   Yeah ... I'm down here.  They're all around.  ,7,5
MULDER:    You armed?  ,7,5
MULDER:    Shoot for the head.  That seems to stop 'em. There's three more of 'em.  ,7,5
MULDER:    I don't know.  They're hiding.  ,7,5
"MULDER:     Yeah, I think so.  ",7,5
MULDER:    Look out!  ,7,5
"MULDER:    Frank, good luck with everything.  ",7,5
MULDER:    The world didn't end.  ,7,5
"MULDER:    Happy New Year, Scully.  ",7,5
MULDER:    Uh.  There you are.  Heavy traffic?  ,7,6
MULDER:    Thoughtfully provided by the local authorities even though it doesn't begin to tell the whole story.  ,7,6
MULDER:    Except that the deputy was beaten to death by an invisible assailant.  ,7,6
"MULDER:    One Tony Reed, and I'm guessing wrongfully accused. He's an ""A"" student moved here a few months ago from Philadelphia. He's never been in trouble in his life.  ",7,6
MULDER:    Maybe.  Take a look at the body.  ,7,6
"MULDER:    The former Deputy Ronald Foster.  As you can see, the report doesn't quite do it justice.  ",7,6
MULDER:    Police flashlight.  One blow.  ,7,6
MULDER:    Check out the back of his head.  ,7,6
"MULDER:    Penetrated to the back of his skull.  Babe Ruth couldn't hit this hard, let alone a high school sophomore.  ",7,6
"MULDER:    No, his tox screen came back negative.  ",7,6
"MULDER:    Uh, Sheriff Harden, this is my partner, Agent Scully.  ",7,6
"MULDER:    Well, uh... we're done here. (casually to SCULLY)  Right? But, Sheriff Harden, you won't mind if I talk to Tony Reed, do you? I mean, it won't hurt your case and if he did do it, you'll want to know why.  ",7,6
"MULDER:    (defensively, laughing)  What?  ",7,6
"MULDER:    Well, Tony, this must be your lucky day for visitors. This is Agent Scully with the FBI ...  ",7,6
"MULDER:    Come on, you were cruising, right?  I mean, a small town like this you're not exactly living La Vida Loca.  I know-- I grew up in Dullsville, too, you know.  Nothing to do but drive and park.  ",7,6
"MULDER:    Okay, but bear with us 'cause we're old and stupid.  (SCULLY appears to hide a smile by looking down.)   How long was it between the time you heard the scream to the time you found Deputy Foster?  ",7,6
"MULDER:    Okay, but you didn't see anyone near the patrol car? You didn't hear anything?  And you're still gonna stick with your story that you were the only one there.  Is that right?  ",7,6
"MULDER:    If you really think he's guilty, Scully, why don't you ask yourself this:  why wouldn't he make up a more plausible cover story? Why didn't he say that, uh, a pickup full of hillbillies drove by and clobbered the Deputy and ran away?  ",7,6
MULDER:    I'm not sure there was a person to see. I think there was a force at work here.  ,7,6
"MULDER:    I don't know-- some kind of territorial or spiritual entity, maybe. (SCULLY sighs)  Poltergeists have long been associated with violent acts like this and they tend to manifest around young people.  They seem to be drawn to the turmoil of adolescence.  ",7,6
"MULDER:    Chastity, what did you and Tony talk about this morning?  ",7,6
MULDER:    How can you be so sure?  ,7,6
MULDER:    Were you there when it happened?  ,7,6
"MULDER:    Chastity, if you know something now is the time to mention it.  ",7,6
"MULDER:    Wow, you must be her lawyer.  ",7,6
"MULDER:    Gee, butting in to our investigation.  I wonder what your father, the sheriff, would think.  ",7,6
MULDER:    You got the same last name.  ,7,6
MULDER:    Back in the day.  ,7,6
MULDER:  (holding up the item he picked up)    Was this here before?  ,7,6
MULDER:    (reaching for the remote)  May I?  ,7,6
"MULDER:    Scully, check this out.  ",7,6
"MULDER:    (advancing the tape one frame at a time)  Oh, here it comes. Now you see it... and one more frame... now you don't.  What do you make of that, Scully?  Take another look.  Now it's here... Now it's not.  ",7,6
"MULDER:    Hey, Chuck.  ",7,6
MULDER:    What'd you come up with?  ,7,6
"MULDER:    Buckle up, Scully.  I believe Chuck is about to take us on a ride into the paranormal.  ",7,6
MULDER:    That's what the gunk on the floor turned out to be.  ,7,6
"MULDER:    (smiling)  Chuck, I get the feeling you don't know what the hell this is.  ",7,6
MULDER:    A shadow.  ,7,6
MULDER:    Unless it's a solid object.  ,7,6
"MULDER:    You recognize these colors, Scully?  ",7,6
MULDER:    I'll show you my theory if you show me yours.  ,7,6
MULDER:    What about for these globs of goo?  ,7,6
MULDER:    Yep. I'm guessing Max Harden could tell us how they got there.  ,7,6
"MULDER:    I spoke to a few students myself.  Apparently, Max was angry at Mr. Babbitt because he failed him on his mid-term exam so he had motive.  ",7,6
"MULDER:    Maybe he didn't need to.   I pulled his records.  Rising attendance and discipline problems over the last few months, but look at his transcript.  (shows folder)  As his behavior was getting worse his grades were going through the roof.  This kid has changed, Scully.  ",7,6
MULDER:    But what if it's given him a kind of psychokinetic or paranormal ability ... (SCULLY's eyebrow shoots up.) ... that allows him to exert force over a victim without ever laying a finger on him?  ,7,6
"MULDER:    Yes, it is.  Soon to be proven as soon as I get Max in for questioning.  ",7,6
"MULDER:    Yeah, I want to talk to him about his son.  ",7,6
"MULDER:    Max could tell them.  You know why you collapsed don't you, Max?  ",7,6
MULDER:    You think?  Smells like murder to me.  ,7,6
"MULDER:    You got a problem with authority figures, don't you, Max?  ",7,6
"MULDER:    No, something else.  You figured out a way to tap into something that gives you superhuman powers.  It came in handy with Babbitt and Deputy Foster.  ",7,6
MULDER:    The rush.  I think whatever it is that gives you the power to rearrange furniture and turn a flashlight into a battering ram also gives you quite a buzz.  ,7,6
MULDER:    I don't know.  Maybe the effect's worn off. Maybe you need another fix.  ,7,6
MULDER:    Sir... Can we have a word outside?  ,7,6
MULDER:    If your son is in trouble I'm sure you'd want to know about it. With that in mind we'd like permission to search your house.  ,7,6
MULDER:    Anything interesting?  ,7,6
MULDER:    What is it?  ,7,6
MULDER:    What?  ,7,6
MULDER:    What would cause this?  ,7,6
MULDER:    I think I'm starting to get it.  ,7,6
MULDER:    Max Harden's personal effects.  ,7,6
"MULDER:    Oh... This is it.  Those globs we found?  This is where they came from.  Speed, Scully.  Somehow, Max Harden has found a way to move faster than the eye can see.  ",7,6
"MULDER:    That would explain how Babbitt was killed.  It would also explain how a chair and a table appeared to move on their own with enough force to penetrate a wall.  Force equals mass times acceleration, isn't that right?  ",7,6
"MULDER:    Exactly. That is, that is why his is falling apart.  ",7,6
"MULDER:    Yo, Scully... How bad are his injuries?  ",7,6
MULDER:    Yeah. Delivered with this: (holds up flashlight)  Max's weapon of choice against cops.  ,7,6
"MULDER:    No, I think somebody intervened.  I think that's why the Sheriff is still alive and why his gun is missing.  ",7,6
MULDER:    It's someone who knows exactly how Max does what he does and someone who's finally standing up to him.  ,7,6
"MULDER:    Well, I would guess the source where Max gets his power from.  ",7,6
"MULDER:    Well, maybe that's why the deputy was killed. Maybe he got too close to the truth.  ",7,6
MULDER:    Yeah. 18 geologists and three semis full of gear. They covered every inch of that cave.  ,7,6
"MULDER:    Nothing.  Well, bat guano and above-normal magnetic field readings but nothing that would cause a physiological effect.  ",7,6
"MULDER:    I don't know.  A vortex, like the one in Oregon.  Gravitational aberrations, unique chemical compositions, uh, relics that would indicate that the cave was a sacred site... something, anything.  I don't know.  ",7,6
"MULDER:    What if we're too old?  Well, you said that teenagers differ from adults chemically and physiologically.  What if whatever is in that cave affects only them?  ",7,6
"MULDER:    Yeah? Well, we can't. As of an hour ago, they pumped concrete into the cave. Sealed it for precautionary reasons.  We'll never know. How's he doing?  ",7,6
MULDER:    Yeah.  Someone forgot to throw away the key.  ,7,7
"MULDER:    Donnie Pfaster is a death fetishist-- a collector of bone and dead flesh, of toenails and hair.  It's what floats his boat, gets him off.  ",7,7
MULDER:    Sick would describe him.  We found women's fingers in his freezer. He liked to eat them with his peas and carrots.  ,7,7
MULDER:    Just women.  Been five years in here thinking about only that. I'm sure he's worked up quite an appetite.  ,7,7
MULDER:    Case closed.  ,7,7
"MULDER:    Didn't look at the file, did you?  ",7,7
"MULDER:    (circling her)  Not a man.  Donnie Pfaster.  And he didn't just escape, he walked out.  He walked out of a maximum security facility and no one seems to know how he did it.  ",7,7
"MULDER:    (walking toward her)   That's why I'm here.  I don't know about you.  Why are you here?  Go home, Scully.  ",7,7
MULDER:    The man abducted you.  Donnie Pfaster did a number on your head like I've never seen and it's okay ... to walk away.  ,7,7
"MULDER:    Well, this isn't the first incident.  Two prisoners have escaped from maximum security facilities in neighboring states over the past year. at 6:06 this morning Donnie Pfaster made it three.  ",7,7
"MULDER:    Dozens of witnesses, guards, and staff, and no one seems to remember anything.  For a while, they didn't even know these guys were missing.  ",7,7
"MULDER:    No, neither of the men have ever been seen again.  ",7,7
"MULDER:    Yes, but I'm still a little confused.  Maybe you could go over it again.  ",7,7
MULDER:    Then I know you'll tell me the truth.  ,7,7
MULDER:    You and Donnie Pfaster were in the garment shop at or about the time he disappeared.  ,7,7
"MULDER:    Yeah, but you had something happen.  You had an incident.  ",7,7
MULDER:    You cried out to the guards that you'd cut your hands.  ,7,7
"MULDER:    Others saw them, too.  ",7,7
MULDER:    How do you explain that?  ,7,7
MULDER:    Post-hypnotic suggestion.  Did you see him?  ,7,7
"MULDER:    A programmed behavior prompted and manifested by suggestion in this case, a rhythmic motion of the hands producing a unconscious act in a conscious state.  ",7,7
MULDER:    Doesn't work on you.  ,7,7
MULDER:    Group hypnosis.  ,7,7
MULDER:    Mesmer was able to hypnotize and command entire audiences.  ,7,7
MULDER:    I'm not saying that it was Donnie.  ,7,7
"MULDER:    Three inmates are missing from three separate prisons.  One man has had possible contact with each of those cons.   The prison chaplain. (bad Southern accent)  Glory. Amen.  (SCULLY again notices the song ""Don't Look Any Further"" playing.  She walks over to the heating vent to hear it better.) Not God, the chaplain.  Scully, what?  ",7,7
MULDER:    Barely.  ,7,7
"MULDER:    (smiling)   Well, I think if it was a make out song I think it'd be ruined forever now, huh?  ",7,7
MULDER:    Was he here?  ,7,7
MULDER:    We got a call about a possible sighting of the suspect.  ,7,7
"MULDER:    Well, something happened here, huh?  ",7,7
"MULDER:    (very sarcastic)   The Good Reverend.  How do you do? Or maybe I should say,  ""How do you do it?""  ",7,7
"MULDER:    Well, this delivery arrived a little late-- a little late and a little cold as a matter of fact.  I thought you'd want to see it.  ",7,7
"MULDER:    Blood of the lamb, Reverend.  Handiwork of Mr. Donnie Pfaster-- a young girl he picked up at the bus stop.  ",7,7
"MULDER:    Where is he, Reverend?  ",7,7
MULDER:    No. Donnie was supposed to die.  You were supposed to kill him. That's why you freed him.  God knows you're capable of it.  (to SCULLY) The Reverend Orison is really Robert Gailen Orison-- convicted in 1959 of first degree murder. Served 22 years in Soledad.  ,7,7
"MULDER:    When God spoke to you, Reverend, did He happen to mention where Donnie was headed?  ",7,7
MULDER:    To prove that man's a liar.  ,7,7
"MULDER:    God is a spectator, Scully.  He just reads the box scores.  ",7,7
MULDER:    You think God directs that man?  You think He directs him to kill?  ,7,7
"MULDER:    So, what?  You think that God directs him to ... let the prisoners out to kill?  ",7,7
"MULDER:    Well, plenty of nut bags do.  Has he ever spoken to you?  ",7,7
MULDER:    (curious)   What did he say?  ,7,7
MULDER:    What does it mean?  ,7,7
MULDER:    (gentle)   What?  ,7,7
MULDER:    (sympathetic)   Hmm...  ,7,7
"MULDER:    So, what do you think that God is telling you?  ",7,7
"MULDER:    Well, all right.  Come with me, Scout.  I'll show you how the Reverend talks to God.  ",7,7
MULDER:    It's a cerebral edema.  ,7,7
"MULDER:    Except this isn't accidental.  The cause, in fact, as it was stated to me is self-inflicted.  There's a small hole here in the skull which allows oxygen into the brain cavity, the result of which is the Reverend Orison has three times the normal blood volume pumping through his brain.  ",7,7
MULDER:    Yeah. My guess is he-he probably did it when he first got into prison-- when he first learned how to use its powers.  ,7,7
"MULDER:    There's a theory that at this point in human evolution our mental capabilities are limited only by inadequate blood supply.  In fact, centuries ago, in the Peruvian Andes, Holy Men used to physically remove parts of their skulls in order to increase blood volume or drill small holes.  ",7,7
"MULDER:    The practitioners of this found that they could perform certain mental tricks one of which they called ""stopping the world.""  ",7,7
"MULDER:    Yeah, but maybe they can alter perception of it creating a disparate version of reality which they can then project through hypnosis.  ",7,7
MULDER:    Donnie Pfaster is serving a life sentence without possibility of parole.  That's the final judgment as far as society is concerned but not in the eyes of God or in the eyes of a man who thinks he's God's tool.  ,7,7
MULDER:    I don't know.  Maybe he unleashed something that he couldn't control.  Maybe he thought he was opening the door of perception but then unwittingly he... opened the gates of Hell.  ,7,7
MULDER:    Marshal?  ,7,7
MULDER:    Marshal?  ,7,7
"MULDER:    (looking at the MARSHAL's empty holster)  He's gone, Scully, so's the Marshal's gun.  ",7,7
"MULDER:    Let's go, Scully.  ",7,7
MULDER:    What is it?  ,7,7
MULDER:    Did you tell him?  ,7,7
"MULDER:    Oh, he must have...  overheard us when we were talking in the hallway.  ",7,7
MULDER:    I'm sure you did.  ,7,7
MULDER:    Well... maybe this was meant for you.  Don't look any further.  ,7,7
"MULDER:    You know, it's funny, when all is said and done, there's... not much mystery in murder.  ",7,7
MULDER:    What do you mean?  ,7,7
"MULDER:    I guess in his own twisted way he was making good with his God.  Glory, Amen.  Let's go home, Scully.  ",7,7
"MULDER:    This X-File is over... lying dead there in a grave he dug himself. Let's let the US Marshals take over from here.  Don't look any further, Scully.  ",7,7
MULDER:   (recorded voice)   This is Fox Mulder.  Leave a message after the ... (beep).  ,7,7
MULDER:    Excuse me.  ,7,7
"MULDER:    If you want to pack some things, we can get out of here.  ",7,7
MULDER:    You can't judge yourself.  ,7,7
MULDER:    The Bible allows for vengeance.  ,7,7
MULDER:    (leaning into her)   The way I see it... he didn't give you a choice.  And my report will reflect that... in case you're worried.  Donnie Pfaster would've surely killed again if given the chance.  ,7,7
MULDER:    What's that?  ,7,7
MULDER:    You mean if it was God?  ,7,7
"MULDER:    Neat trick, huh?  ",7,8
"MULDER:    Come on, Scully.  This isn't intriguing enough for you?  A magician turns his head completely around 360 degrees to the delight of young and old alike after which it plops unceremoniously onto the pier... see the picture?  (he holds up the photo from the file)  ",7,8
MULDER:    But...  ,7,8
MULDER:    You think this was a murder?  ,7,8
"MULDER:    (in an affected presentational tone)   Ah, observe the nearly complete absence of blood. Observe the paucity of fingerprints as evidenced by the LAPD's liberal use of lycopodium powder.  ",7,8
MULDER:    Know that the Amazing Maleeni was alive one moment and expired the next.  Know also that no one saw his fleeing attacker nor heard the dying man's cries.  ,7,8
MULDER:    A magic trick gone horribly wrong.  One that claims the lives of all who attempt it.  ,7,8
MULDER:    Can I see that camcorder again?  Thank you.  A tourist videotaped Maleeni's performance. Look at this.  ,7,8
MULDER:    I don't know.  ,7,8
"MULDER:    Neat trick, huh?  ",7,8
"MULDER:    What, you think he's a murderer?  ",7,8
MULDER:    That'll be a neat trick in itself.  You never see his face.  ,7,8
MULDER:    Provided they haven't dumped the trash.  ,7,8
MULDER:     You attended a magic show.  The Amazing Maleeni.  ,7,8
MULDER:    A conviction for pick pocketing.  ,7,8
MULDER:    What did you have against Mr. Maleeni?  ,7,8
MULDER:    What about the trick where he turns his head completely around?  ,7,8
"MULDER:    Those are great, but I don't see how they're any different or better than the ones Maleeni did.  ",7,8
MULDER:    Enough to make a magician lose his head?  ,7,8
MULDER:    Mozart and Salieri.  Which one's which?  ,7,8
MULDER:    If it was a murder.  I'm not convinced.  ,7,8
MULDER:    What do you think?  ,7,8
MULDER:    So he was murdered.  ,7,8
MULDER:    Natural causes.  ,7,8
"MULDER:    So, basically he died of a heart attack, somebody crept up behind him, sawed his head off and then glued it back on all in the space of 30 seconds.  (begins laughing)   Does that make sense to you?  ",7,8
MULDER:    And yet he performed yesterday.  What a trouper.  ,7,8
MULDER:    Excuse me.  I'm looking for Mr. Albert Pinchbeck.  ,7,8
"MULDER:    He look familiar to you, Scully?  ",7,8
MULDER:    The plot thickens.  ,7,8
MULDER:    (quickly as he and SCULLY pull out their badges)   Agents... Mulder and Scully.  FBI.  ,7,8
"MULDER:    What happened to your neck, Mr. Pinchbeck?  ",7,8
MULDER:    Car accident.  So your injured neck has nothing to do with a magic trick you performed at the Santa Monica Pier two days ago?  One which involved you turning your head around 360 degrees?  ,7,8
"MULDER:    (not believing it)  Oh, bad Mexican car accident.  (to SCULLY)   In Mexico.  ",7,8
MULDER:    Why did you stop?  ,7,8
"MULDER:    Pick a card, any card?  ",7,8
MULDER:    Hmm.  Very impressive.  ,7,8
"MULDER:    I have a theory, Mr. Pinchbeck and I'm going to tell you how it goes.  I think that your brother Herman died of heart disease having never made it as the world's greatest magician and I think that hurt you just as your estrangement from him hurt you.  And I think what you did was perform his last act for him--  (SCULLY glances at MULDER.)   -- one last act for which he'd always be remembered-- one last act that would end with such a shock, such a denouement as would be forever remembered in the annals of magic.  That's what I think.  ",7,8
MULDER:    (rubbing his face)   Oy.  ,7,8
MULDER:    A guy's head falls off.  It's the greatest trick in the world.  Only there's no discernible point to it.  What's the reason for doing that in the first place?  ,7,8
MULDER:    This one's gained mostly police attention.  Maybe that's the point.  ,7,8
MULDER:    (with sarcastic disgust)   Mozart.  ,7,8
MULDER:    How about the chance to root through the professional secrets of your least favorite magician?  ,7,8
"MULDER:    There's that, and he's got no legs.  ",7,8
MULDER:    How did this impersonator switch out the dead body?  ,7,8
"MULDER:    Maybe not.  You said that, uh, the Amazing Maleeni had some gambling debts?  ",7,8
"MULDER:    Check this out.  It looks like a marker.  $20,000.  Pinchbeck.  ",7,8
MULDER:    Interesting. Yours are the only fingerprints on it.  ,7,8
"MULDER:    Very friendly.  $20,000 friendly.  ",7,8
MULDER:    Why did you play with him in the first place?  You knew he was a professional magician.  ,7,8
"MULDER:    Don't you find it odd that the amazing Maleeni's a lousy poker player?  I mean, this is a guy who's adept at manipulating cards.  ",7,8
MULDER:    There's another possibility.  Behold-- an ordinary household quarter.  (he holds up a quarter.) I'm going to take the quarter from my right hand and place it into my left hand.  (he does with a flourish) Where is it?  ,7,8
"MULDER:    Oh, no, no, no.  ",7,8
"MULDER:    Blow your nose, Scully.  ",7,8
MULDER:    (holding her nose between his fingers)   Blow your nose.  ,7,8
MULDER:    Ta-da.  ,7,8
MULDER:    (proudly)  The great Muldeeni.  ,7,8
MULDER:    It's misdirection.  That's the heart of magic.  I made you look one direction.  The quarter went in the other.  ,7,8
MULDER:    I think we're being led around by our noses.  ,7,8
"MULDER:    It certainly would appear so, but then again, you thought the quarter was in the right hand.  ",7,8
MULDER:    I'll bet.  ,7,8
"MULDER:    Let's take a little spin, shall we?  ",7,8
"MULDER:    It's about misdirection, Mr. Pinchbeck... or should I say the Amazing Maleeni?  ",7,8
"MULDER:    It's a trick, Scully.   Voila.  ",7,8
MULDER:    That was your last performance.  ,7,8
MULDER:    I still think you've got a few tricks up your sleeve.  ,7,8
MULDER:    Did he have access to the vaults?  ,7,8
"MULDER:    Any hint at all as to why Maleeni, here is really impersonating his brother.  What about this. (taps the computer monitor)  Could he have removed the funds electronically?  ",7,8
MULDER:    Maybe he got around the security.  Can we check the withdrawal records?  ,7,8
MULDER:    (taking his handcuffs back)   We'll hold you till we find out.  Make sure you don't pull a vanishing act.  ,7,8
MULDER:    Maleeni?  ,7,8
MULDER:    Yeah. I guarantee you none of them match our thieves.  They're too clever to leave clues... except for the ones they want us to find.  ,7,8
MULDER:    Yeah.  Who is he to you?  ,7,8
MULDER:    The magician?  Maleeni?  ,7,8
MULDER:    (to SCULLY)   And the Amazing Maleeni.  That's a double bill I wouldn't want to miss.  ,7,8
"MULDER:    Give us a minute, will you?  ",7,8
"MULDER:    Good morning, gentlemen.  Did you sleep well?  ",7,8
MULDER:    Bravo.  Really.  ,7,8
"MULDER:    (smiling)   Well, thank you.  It was, wasn't it?  It's only that Alvarez was so obviously guilty. A convicted bank robber caught red-handed witnessed trying to rob an armored car just two days earlier?  ",7,8
"MULDER:    Yeah. Yeah, he's up a creek...  Just like you two want him.  ",7,8
"MULDER:    I have no evidence but I have a theory, Mr. Maleeni and, uh, I'll tell you how it goes.  I think that your twin brother, Albert, died of a heart attack at which point you and your young protégé saw a golden opportunity.  ",7,8
MULDER:    You wanted revenge against the man who made your life in prison a living hell.  ,7,8
MULDER:    Alvarez. You and he were in the same cell block eight years ago.  ,7,8
"MULDER:    Which gave LaBonge and ""in"" with Alvarez once everybody thought you were dead.  ",7,8
"MULDER:    Yeah. That was you in the armored car disguised as Alvarez.   (Flashback of PINCHBEK looking at the gun)  Somehow, Mr. Pinchbeck got ahold of the guard's gun and switched the clip.  Guard didn't know it, but he was firing blanks.   (Flashback of GUARD firing into the truck)  ",7,8
MULDER:    You have great alibis.  You have the best alibis in the world which is why I think you two got arrested in the first place.  ,7,8
"MULDER:    You could have escaped, stolen the money framed Alvarez and been back here in time for breakfast.  ",7,8
MULDER:    One that would be forever remembered in the annals of magic.  ,7,8
MULDER:    To you?  You go free... provided the magic is over.  ,7,8
MULDER:    They are the world's greatest.  ,7,8
"MULDER:    Nah, there's more.  ",7,8
MULDER:    Behold!  The Amazing Maleeni's wallet.  ,7,8
MULDER:    No. I pilfered it from the evidence room to prevent them from completing their final act of prestidigitation.  ,7,8
"MULDER:    I began to wonder, why did they need so elaborate a setup?  Why so high profile?  Why draw the attention of the FBI in the first place?  ",7,8
"MULDER:    Yes. Framing Alvarez was just another misdirection.  This trick was about EFTs--  electronic funds transfers at the bank.  Maleeni, Pinchbeck-- he didn't have security clearance for them so he needed a little federal law enforcement intervention--  specifically, my badge number... (Flashback of MULDER's badge - agent number  22791)    and my  thumbprint.  (Flashback of MULDER taking the King of Diamonds.)  With those two items, they could pull off an EFT and steal enough electronically as to make that $1.8 million look like cigar-lighting money.  But they can't do it without this.  Pick a card, Scully... Any card.  ",7,8
MULDER:    What's that?  ,7,8
MULDER:    I don't know that.  ,7,8
MULDER:    Gee! Very nice.  How'd you do that?  ,7,8
"MULDER:    No. Seriously, Scully, how'd you do it?  You know, it's not the same thing.  It's different with the head.  Come on.  Look at this.  ",7,8
MULDER:    I'll show you - - -  ,7,8
"MULDER:   (on phone)   Not as far as you know? ...  Not this time of year? ... All right.  Thank you, Doctor.  Good-bye.  ",7,9
"MULDER:    Lots and lots of snakes.  Very pissed off ones, from the look of it.  ",7,9
"MULDER:    That's the former Mr. Jared Chirp of McMinn County, Tennessee.  ",7,9
MULDER:    116 separate bite marks.  Judging from the wound measurements there were 50 different snakes involved--  mostly copperheads and rattlers.  ,7,9
"MULDER:    Yeah, with a pistol in his hand.  He fired six shots, into the floorboards, into the passenger seat, even into his own right kneecap, and the windows were shut and the doors were locked.  ",7,9
"MULDER:    No one seems to know that.  There was not a scale found. I just got off the phone with a herpetologist at the Smithsonian, and he's stumped - especially because these rattlesnakes tend to hibernate in winter.  ",7,9
"MULDER:    Well, it certainly would appear that way but the question is ""how?""  There's no physical evidence at all-- no tire tracks, no footprints. I can't see how anyone could have accomplished this.  And then you got to ask yourself  ""why?""  Why would anybody use poisonous snakes as a murder weapon?  ",7,9
MULDER:    Maybe these ones actually do.  ,7,9
MULDER:    (with a smile)   Mmm ... No.   But at the very least this case does seem to center around religion ... and you're not the only one to think that by the way.  ,7,9
"MULDER:    Reverend Samuel Mackey?  My name is Fox Mulder. This is Dana Scully.  We're with the FBI.  May be speak with you, sir?  ",7,9
MULDER:    We apologize for our timing.  We'd like to ask you a few questions about Jared Chirp.  ,7,9
"MULDER:    Specifically, you had suspicions about the manner in which he died?  ",7,9
"MULDER:    As a sign of faith, worshipers handle deadly snakes or drink poison.  ",7,9
MULDER:    Why did he walk away?  ,7,9
MULDER:    That's funny.  I knew a couple of Catholic schoolgirls who were expert at it.  ,7,9
MULDER:    Enoch O'Connor?  Federal Agents.  (to SCULLY)   Where's the light switch?  ,7,9
"MULDER:    I don't know, Scully.  When you... when you get right down to it is snake handling any harder to buy into than communion wafers or transubstantiation...?  ",7,9
MULDER:    I'm just saying that-that your faith and O'Connor's seem to be based on the same book.  ,7,9
"MULDER:    Uh-oh, Scully.  What do you think O'Connor keeps in here?  ",7,9
MULDER:    (shaking the box)   It's all right. It's empty.  ,7,9
"MULDER:    Reverend, do something about these snakes, please.  ",7,9
"MULDER:    (very nervous)    Just in case we're not, we could use a little righteous help here.  ",7,9
MULDER:    He died from multiple snakebites.  We thought maybe you'd have a special insight into that.  ,7,9
"MULDER:    He does seem like a likely suspect only the local sheriff's office ruled him out.  Apparently, he was in Kentucky the night Jared Chirp died.  ",7,9
MULDER:    Jared Chirp died with a packed suitcase by his side. There's got to be somebody that knows where he was headed.  ,7,9
"MULDER:    Reverend, how close was Iris to Jared Chirp?  ",7,9
MULDER:    What'd you talk about?  ,7,9
MULDER:    Maybe that was the point.  ,7,9
MULDER:    We would appreciate anything you could tell us about him.  ,7,9
"MULDER:    Keeping an open mind, Gracie, is it conceivable that O'Connor could have done any of this?  ",7,9
MULDER:    (realizing)    O'Connor is your father.  ,7,9
MULDER:    O'Connor barred her from his church.  She and Jared Chirp.  ,7,9
MULDER:    You coming?  ,7,9
"MULDER:    ""Pray for the souls ... lost to us.""  ",7,9
MULDER:    Let her go!  ,7,9
MULDER:    I'd say it's good news for you that she's not here right now ... considering what you tried to do to her.  Is that what you did to your wife?  ,7,9
"MULDER:    Alice O'Connor... succumbed to multiple snakebites in June, 1994. It happened during a church service or at least that's what you told local police.  You got away with it...  almost.  What was, uh... the problem with your wife?  Was she not... righteous enough for you?  Just like your daughter's boyfriend ... or Iris Finster?  ",7,9
MULDER:    Smart enough to know you're a murderer.  ,7,9
"MULDER:    No one quite passes muster with you, huh?  You feel the need to exact some kind of Old Testament revenge?  What about your daughter? What were your plans for her?  ",7,9
MULDER:    Because she no longer believes as you do?  ,7,9
MULDER:    Deputy found him about an hour ago.  There's no telling when he was attacked.  ,7,9
MULDER:    Unless he somehow managed to do this to himself ... (SCULLY looks at him)  ...  as a test of his own righteousness.  ,7,9
MULDER:    What about antivenin treatment?  ,7,9
MULDER:    Why not?  ,7,9
MULDER:    And you're thinking that her actions may not be entirely motivated by concern for her father's eternal soul?  ,7,9
MULDER:    Do you think this is what she meant?  ,7,9
"MULDER:    I can see her being angry enough at her father to attack him, but...  what about the others?  ",7,9
"MULDER:    He left in a hurry.  Packed one suitcase and a gun.  Earlier that night he calls Gracie.  Gets Iris instead.  Starts rambling about paying for his sins.  He's frightened... wants to leave town, presumably with Gracie.  ",7,9
MULDER:   (shaking the snake's rattle that he finds on the dresser)  It's not so hard to understand.  It's a culture with a very well-defined set of rules.  ,7,9
"MULDER:    I don't know, Scully.  Sometimes a little intolerance can be a welcome thing.  Clear-cut right and wrong, black and white, no shades of gray.  You know, in a society where hard and fast rules are harder and harder to come by, I think some people would appreciate that.  ",7,9
MULDER:    I'm just saying that somebody offering you all the answers... could be a very powerful thing.  ,7,9
"MULDER:    Oh, it's lab results.  Am I reading this right?  That Jared Chirp had himself tested for sterility?  ",7,9
MULDER:    It's dated the day he died.  ,7,9
MULDER:    Maybe he took her.  ,7,9
MULDER:    We know that.  What about it?  ,7,9
MULDER:    Scully.  Take a look at this.  ,7,9
MULDER:    (getting up and leaving)   Stay with her.  ,7,9
MULDER:    To find her father.  He's going to want to tie up some loose ends.  ,7,9
MULDER:    Drop the knife!  ,7,9
MULDER:    You all right?  ,7,9
MULDER:    Relax.  Help's on the way.  ,7,9
MULDER:    It wasn't O'Connor.  It was you.  You killed Jared Chirp.  ,7,9
"MULDER:    No, I'm just beginning to see it now.  Jared must have come to understand that he wasn't the father of Gracie's baby...  that you were.  Did he confront you earlier that night only to see you for who you really are?  ",7,9
MULDER:    Is that what happened with Iris Finster?  Was she beginning to catch on?  Is that why you killed her?  Or was it just to further frame Enoch O'Connor?  Is that what this is really about?  Ruining O'Connor?  Seducing his daughter?  Destroying him by any conceivable means?  ,7,9
MULDER:    Stay where you are.  ,7,9
MULDER:    Help!  ,7,9
MULDER:    Mackey?  ,7,9
MULDER:    They won't find him.  People think the devil has horns and a tail. They're not used to looking for some kindly man who tells you what you want to hear.  ,7,9
MULDER:    Not like O'Connor.  If this was some kind of test looks like I failed.  ,7,9
MULDER:    (smiling at her)  Proud and fancy-free.  ,7,9
MULDER:    I want this case.  ,7,10
"MULDER:    (sarcastic)   Ooh, I can see that.  ",7,10
MULDER:    I'm aware of the facts.  ,7,10
MULDER:    That's what I'm talking about-- ruling out other possibilities.  ,7,10
"MULDER:    Two, three, four hours-- this case is going to be a circus.  Every starstruck attorney in America is going to want to represent these people for free.  If somebody doesn't ask the right questions right now they may never get asked.  ",7,10
MULDER:    They think she's dead.  Don't bet on it.  ,7,10
"MULDER:    Special Agent Fox Mulder, FBI.  I'd like to speak to Mr. and Mrs. LaPierre, if I may.  ",7,10
"MULDER:    Mr. Bring, your  your card says ""real estate law and conveyances.""  Have you ever handled a murder case?  ",7,10
"MULDER:    Well, it might as well be once the facts about Amber Lynn's disappearance get out.  ",7,10
"MULDER:    Yeah.  If you really want to help your clients, Mr. Bring get them a real lawyer.  ",7,10
"MULDER:    Mr. And Mrs. LaPierre, my name is Fox Mulder.  I'm a Special Agent with the FBI and I have a lot of experience with crimes like the one that took place here.  I know you've made a statement to the police but I'd like to ask you some questions about that and I'd like you to answer in as much detail as both you and your lawyer are comfortable with.  I want to ask you about the note you found.  Where did you find it?  ",7,10
MULDER:    When?  ,7,10
"MULDER:    Um, do you know what time that was?  ",7,10
MULDER:    What were you watching?  ,7,10
"MULDER:    What about you, Mrs. LaPierre?  ",7,10
MULDER:    Were you asleep?  ,7,10
MULDER:    Is that Amber Lynn's bedroom that I saw down the hallway there?  ,7,10
MULDER:    Do you always lock your doors at night even if you're home?  ,7,10
"MULDER:    You know most of your neighbors, I bet up and down the street. You're on good terms with them?  ",7,10
MULDER:    Can you think of anyone that might have wanted to hurt Amber Lynn?  ,7,10
"MULDER:    Mr. and Mrs. LaPierre, I want you to understand something because it's going to get very confusing from here on in.  But whatever else the FBI says or does they're going to try their damndest to find your little girl.  ",7,10
MULDER:    Thank you.  ,7,10
"MULDER:    (softly)    Oh, I hope so.  Yeah...  I really do.  ",7,10
MULDER:    It's open.  ,7,10
MULDER:    Come on in.  ,7,10
MULDER:    Thinking.  ,7,10
MULDER:    Amber Lynn LaPierre.  ,7,10
MULDER:    (softly)   Yeah.  I do.  ,7,10
MULDER:    I'm sure he is.  ,7,10
MULDER:    I don't have a report.  ,7,10
"MULDER:    They're not guilty, Scully.  ",7,10
MULDER:    They lied about where they found the note.  ,7,10
MULDER:    That's what I've been thinking about.  ,7,10
"MULDER:    She's not dead, Scully.  ",7,10
MULDER:   (on phone)    Mulder.  ,7,10
MULDER:   (on phone)    Mom?  Hi.  ,7,10
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Yes.  I am.  Are you okay, Mom?  ",7,10
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Well, I'm not sure.  I... You know, I...  I don't know.  ",7,10
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Okay, I will.  Um, you take care, Mom, okay?  ",7,10
MULDER:    Is it her handwriting?  ,7,10
MULDER:    But not an indictment.  ,7,10
MULDER:    Bud LaPierre says he'd been watching television and had gotten up to go to bed when he found Amber Lynn missing.  But according to the police report the TV set was still on when the first officers arrived on the scene.  By his own account both mother and father put Amber Lynn to bed and were never more than 20 feet from her room during the period in which she was abducted.  The LaPierres know all their neighbors up and down the street -- are on good terms with them.  But no one saw a stranger on a Friday at a fairly early hour enter into a locked and lighted home and remove this little girl undetected.  ,7,10
MULDER:    I don't think so.  ,7,10
MULDER:    Because that doesn't explain what happened to this little girl.  ,7,10
MULDER:    There's something in that abduction note that I've seen before.  ,7,10
"MULDER:    (with a soft smile at himself)   My sister was taken by aliens.  Did I say anything about aliens, Scully.  ",7,10
MULDER:    What did I do? I provided a logical counterpoint.  ,7,10
MULDER:    And they are.  ,7,10
"MULDER:    Pocatello, Idaho, 1987.  Look familiar?  ",7,10
"MULDER:    Hi, Miss Tencate, my name is Agent Mulder.  This is Agent Scully.  Will you have a seat?  ",7,10
"MULDER:    (gentle)   Um, we just have a few questions.  We've reviewed the facts of your case and the facts seem to speak for themselves.  Your six-year-old son, Dean, was taken from his bed while he slept.  A note was found threatening his life later determined to be written by you.  You plead innocent at trial but you were convicted and sentenced to 12 years even though your son's body was never found.  ",7,10
"MULDER:    Your story is that, uh on the night your son disappeared you had a vision of him dead, but you thought it was your mind playing tricks on you but when you got up to check on him he was missing from his bed.  Is that accurate?  ",7,10
"MULDER:    Now, three years ago after seven years of incarceration, you changed your story and confessed to the murder of your son in a fit of insanity.  A psychotic break.  ",7,10
"MULDER:    I have a, uh, copy of the note that you wrote.  Do you mind if I show it to you?  ",7,10
"MULDER:    Now there's a phrase down here at the bottom.  ""No one shoots at Santa Claus.""  Can you explain what that means to me?  ",7,10
MULDER:    A little girl disappeared from her bed three days ago.  This is a note that was left at that scene.  Will you take a look at that and tell me what it says at the bottom?  ,7,10
"MULDER:    Neither note makes a specific demand.  In both cases, there's no evidence of foul play or a break-in.  And as in your son's case there's no body to be found.  ",7,10
"MULDER:    Yes, you did, but, uh, it wasn't where you said it was going to be.  ",7,10
MULDER:    I think you can.  ,7,10
"MULDER:    You can't explain it because you didn't do anything.  You didn't kill your son and you didn't bury him.  You're not guilty of anything other than a lie just like these people.  The only reason you changed your story was to get out of here because you knew the parole board might buy the story of a psychotic break and of your terrible remorse but they would never, never let a woman out of jail who claimed her son just disappeared out of thin air.  Now, these people, they need someone to tell them it's okay.  Someone to corroborate their story.  ",7,10
MULDER:    They need your help.  ,7,10
MULDER:    Do you think that woman could have killed her son?  ,7,10
MULDER:    So how do you explain those two notes written ten years apart could contain the same obscure phrase?  ,7,10
"MULDER:    No, I'm going to solve this case.  I am going to solve it.  ",7,10
MULDER:    I'm going to find those kids.  ,7,10
MULDER:    (voice on machine)   This is Fox Mulder.  Leave a message.  I'll try to get back to you.  ,7,10
MULDER:    There's something I want your clients to see.  ,7,10
"MULDER:    (putting a cassette into the video player)   Don't shoot at Santa Claus, Mr. Bring.  You're going to want to see it, too.  (to the LAPIERREs.)  I believe you share a secret.  ",7,10
"MULDER:    (on video)   ...Federal investigation of the case will continue but will no longer focus on the LaPierres as primary suspects.  We, uh, we will intensify our search for Amber Lynn and we remain hopeful of her eventual safe return.  ",7,10
MULDER:    I have a corroborating witness.  ,7,10
MULDER:    There's a material connection between these two women.  ,7,10
MULDER:    It doesn't make sense.  It's incomprehensible in any kind of a real world way.  ,7,10
"MULDER:    What is it, Scully?  ",7,10
MULDER:    Over here.  ,7,10
MULDER:    (indicating the prescription bottle)   Diazepam.  She used them to sleep.  ,7,10
"MULDER:    (sighs ""no"")  She called when I was in California.  She wanted to talk, but, uh... I never called her back.  ",7,10
MULDER:    (confused)   Uh... Why would she do this?  It just doesn't make any sense.  ,7,10
"MULDER:    No, she wouldn't kill herself.  (looks at empty frames)   Why are these pictures gone?  There were photos here.  There were photos of my sister and I.  This is all that she had left of us and they're missing.  Why...?  ",7,10
"MULDER:    She saw me on the news.  She wanted to talk about the missing girl, Amber Lynn.  She wanted to tell me something about her, or maybe she couldn't tell me over the phone because she was afraid that they would do something like this to her.  ",7,10
"MULDER:    (rationalizing, grasping)    Whoever took my sister.  Look at this place.  I mean, it's like... it's-it's all staged-- the pills, the oven, the tape.  It's like a bad movie script.  They would  they would have come here and they would have threatened her. She would be upset; they would have to sedate her.  I would look for a, uh... a needle puncture mark or something else in her system besides these pills.  ",7,10
"MULDER:    Scully, who else can I ask?  ",7,10
"MULDER:    I know, but if you don't do it, I might never know the truth.  ",7,10
"MULDER:    (tired, quietly)   You've seen things.  I need to understand them.  ",7,10
MULDER:    My mother is dead.  You know why.  ,7,10
"MULDER:    Look, I can help you.  I can talk to the parole board for you.  But right now, I need you to help me.  ",7,10
MULDER:    I'm not here by accident.  My sister was taken away from me  when she was eight years old... like your son was taken away from you.  ,7,10
MULDER:    (soft laugh)   I don't know.  ,7,10
MULDER:    Why do you ask that?  ,7,10
MULDER:    Tell me what?  ,7,10
MULDER:    Who?  ,7,10
MULDER:    You can see them?  ,7,10
"MULDER:   (pause, perhaps not believing her)   Is my sister dead?  ",7,10
"MULDER:    Where do they take them?  Your boy?  This little girl, Amber Lynn LaPierre?  ",7,10
MULDER:    I'm glad you're here.  My mother was trying to tell me something.  I think I figured it out.  It's something about my sister that she was never able to tell me.  ,7,10
MULDER:    She knew what I'd find with this case out in California.  ,7,10
MULDER:    A child disappearing without a trace-- without evidence-- in defiance of all logical explanation?  She knew because of what's driven me-- what I've always believed.  ,7,10
"MULDER:    Scully, these parents who've lost... (swallows painfully)   who've lost their children... They've had visions of their sons and daughters in scenarios that never happened but which they describe in notes that came through them as automatic writing and words that came through them psychically from old souls protecting the children. My mother must have written a note like that herself.  Describing the scenario of my sister's disappearance of her, of her abduction by aliens.  Don't you see, Scully?  It never happened.  All these visions that I've had have just been...  they've been to help me cope, to help me deal with the loss but... I've been looking for my sister in the wrong place. That's... what my mother was trying to tell me.  That's what she was trying to warn me about.  That's why they killed her.  ",7,10
MULDER:    She was trying to tell me something.  She was...  (voice breaking as he cries) ...trying to tell me something.  ,7,10
MULDER:    What is it?  ,7,10
"MULDER:    (indicating SCULLY)   It's okay.  She's here to help.  What happened here, Billie?  ",7,10
MULDER:    What was she saying?  ,7,10
"MULDER:    ""74""? The number 74?  Does that mean anything to you?  ",7,10
"MULDER:    (without much hope)   74 mean anything to you, Mr. LaPierre?  ",7,10
MULDER:    Let's go home.  ,7,10
MULDER:    We're not going to find these people's daughter alive.  ,7,10
MULDER:    What we're hearing-- it's the delusional talk of people that don't want to accept the truth.  ,7,10
"MULDER:    Maybe, maybe not but you can't see a ghost and still hope to find her alive. Both things can't be true.  And if this little girl's spirit really did appear to her mother then there's probably only one explanation.  ",7,10
"MULDER:    (sad, tired)   I don't know what that means.  I don't know what is the truth and what isn't anymore.  I'm way too close to this case to make any kind of sound judgment.  In fact, I would like to ask for you to let me off this case, please, and I'd like to take some time off.  ",7,10
MULDER:    What?  ,7,10
MULDER:    Some of these tapes go back to the '60s.  ,7,10
MULDER:    I think I know what we're going to find here.  It's what my mother was afraid of.   My sister.  ,7,10
MULDER:    Scully.  ,7,10
MULDER:    (on phone)   Yeah.  I am.  ,7,11
MULDER:    I've been looking for my sister in the wrong place.  That's what my mother was trying to tell me.  ,7,11
"MULDER:   (voiceover)   They said the birds refused to sing and the thermometer fell suddenly as if God Himself had His breath stolen away. No one there dared speak aloud, as much in shame as in sorrow.  They uncovered the bodies one by one.  The eyes of the dead were closed as if waiting for permission to open them.  Were they still dreaming of ice cream and monkey bars?  Of birthday cake and no future but the afternoon?  Or had their innocence been taken along with their lives buried in the cold earth so long ago?  These fates seemed too cruel, even for God to allow.  Or are the tragic young born again when the world's not looking?  I want to believe so badly; in a truth beyond our own hidden and obscured from all but the most sensitive eyes...  ",7,11
MULDER:   (voiceover)   In the endless procession of souls... in what cannot and will not be destroyed.  I want to believe we are unaware of God's eternal recompense and sadness.  That we cannot see His truth.  That that which is born still lives and cannot be buried in the cold earth.  But only waits to be born again at God's behest... where in ancient starlight we lay in repose.  ,7,11
MULDER:    He's got hours of video of her.  ,7,11
"MULDER:    Yeah.  You don't know how badly I wanted her to be in one of those graves.  As hard as it is to admit, I wanted to find her here riding her bike like all these other kids.  I guess I just want it to be over.  ",7,11
MULDER:    Mr. Piller?  ,7,11
MULDER:    How can we help you?  ,7,11
MULDER:    Did he?  ,7,11
MULDER:    What happened?  ,7,11
MULDER:    What happened to them?  ,7,11
MULDER:    What is it?  ,7,11
MULDER:    We still have a missing body -- Amber Lynn LaPierre -- she may be alive -- we don't know.  ,7,11
MULDER:    It's not the first time I've heard what he's saying.  About the intervention of these walk-in spirits?  Kathy Lee Tencate mentioned it to me in prison. She said that's what took her son.  ,7,11
"MULDER:    Or maybe they ""are"" somewhere else.  ",7,11
MULDER:   (looks at her)     I do. ... I do.  ,7,11
MULDER:    How long have you been doing this?  ,7,11
MULDER:    These walk-ins-- you say they come and take the children.  Why?  ,7,11
MULDER:    How do you know that?  ,7,11
MULDER:    You see them.  Do you see Amber Lynn LaPierre?  ,7,11
MULDER:    How's that?  ,7,11
MULDER:    What is the connection?  ,7,11
MULDER:    What? What are you doing?  ,7,11
MULDER:    (Tired)   It's 3:00 in the morning.  ,7,11
"MULDER:    Yeah, the TV is on.  ",7,11
MULDER:    What?  ,7,11
MULDER:    Shoot.  ,7,11
MULDER:    (dryly)   What does she say?  ,7,11
MULDER:    What is she saying?  Harold?  ,7,11
"MULDER:    Come on, Harold.  ",7,11
MULDER:    (angry)    That's crap.  You're full of crap.  ,7,11
MULDER:    Get out of here.  ,7,11
"MULDER:    No, I'm telling you. I never should have listened to you.  ",7,11
MULDER:    Please go.  ,7,11
MULDER:    Who wrote that?  ,7,11
MULDER:   (on phone)    Mulder.  ,7,11
MULDER:   (on phone)    What is it?  ,7,11
MULDER:    (on phone)    In 1973.  I know all about that.  ,7,11
"MULDER:   (on phone)    I don't see where you're going with this, Scully.  ",7,11
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Well, that's not exactly a revelation, Scully. He was a friend of my father's.  ",7,11
MULDER:   (on phone)    I don't see what you think this proves or how you think it's gonna help me find her now.  ,7,11
"MULDER:   (on phone)    It's a dead end.  He's never been of any help and he's not going to be of any help now.  Look, I'm pursuing this my own way, all right?  I got to go.  ",7,11
"MULDER:    Not exactly the end of the rainbow, is it, Harold?  ",7,11
MULDER:    (heading back to the car)   I've had a look.  ,7,11
MULDER:    There's nothing here.  It's a decommissioned base.  ,7,11
MULDER:    Why do you care so much about what I feel?  Why is it so important to you?  ,7,11
MULDER:    My sister was here?  ,7,11
MULDER:    In one of these houses?  Where?  ,7,11
"MULDER:    Which house, Harold?  Come on, which house?  ",7,11
"MULDER:    Harold, we don't have all night.  Come on, which house was it?  ",7,11
"MULDER:    Let's go, Harold.  ",7,11
MULDER:    You were right.  This was the house.  ,7,11
MULDER:    Look.  (points down)  ,7,11
MULDER:    You told me she was here.  You didn't say with who.  ,7,11
"MULDER:    Well, it turns out you were right, Scully.  He had every reason to call off the hunt for my sister.  After her abduction, she was returned to him and he raised her at the military base along with his son, Jeffrey Spender.  ",7,11
"MULDER:    Scully, I saw her name in the cement.  Her handprints, right next to his.  ",7,11
MULDER:    (staring at her)  You went to him?  ,7,11
"MULDER:    (sighs)   Oh, well... he's a liar.  ",7,11
"MULDER:    (loudly)   The handprints prove he's a liar!  I saw her handprints in the cement. Her name, Samantha, right underneath them.  How more obvious can it be?  Harold Piller led me there.  He led me right to them.  ",7,11
"MULDER:    Sit down, Harold.  ",7,11
MULDER:    Agent Scully has informed me that you failed to mention something to me when we first met.  ,7,11
MULDER:    That you're currently the subject of a criminal investigation into the murder of your son.  ,7,11
MULDER:    You only tell me what you see.  ,7,11
"MULDER:    (to SCULLY, taking her hand)   Maybe afterwards we can play postman and spin the bottle.  ",7,11
MULDER:    It's here.  ,7,11
MULDER:    There was a boy - he led me into this room.  ,7,11
"MULDER:    (reading)   ""They did more tests today, but not the horrible kind. I was awake and they made me lay still... while they shined lights in my eyes. They asked me questions, but I always lie now and tell them what they want to hear, just to make them stop.  I hate them and I hate the way they treat me... like I'm an old suitcase they can just drag around and open up whenever they want to.  They know I hate them, but they don't even care.""  ",7,11
MULDER:    This is 1979.  She's 14 years old here.  14 years old.  ,7,11
"MULDER:    (reading)   ""Sometimes I think my memories were taken by the doctors but not all of them.  I remember faces.  I think I had a brother... with brown hair, who used to tease me.  I hope someday he reads this and knows I wish I could see his face for real.""  ",7,11
"MULDER:    And then, uh... she's, uh... talking about running away.  She wants to run away so that they stop doing the tests.  And then it just stops.  ",7,11
"MULDER:    You know, I never stop to think... that the light is billions of years old by the time we see it.  From the beginning of time right past us into the future.  Nothing is ancient in the universe.  (glances at her) But, maybe they are souls, Scully.  Traveling through time as starlight, looking for homes.  I wonder what my mother saw.  And I wonder what she was trying to tell me.  ",7,11
MULDER:    All right.  ,7,11
MULDER:    What are you talking about?  ,7,11
MULDER:    When did you find this?  ,7,11
MULDER:    She didn't give a name at all.  Read this.  It's the medical report.  The admittance notes say the E.R. nurses couldn't get her name out of her.  Neither could the cops.  ,7,11
"MULDER:    (reading)   ""Evidence of probable self-inflicted abuse.  Including small crescent-shaped scars on her knees, wrists and chest.""  Those were from the tests, Scully.  That's her.  She was here. 14 years old, in this hospital.  ",7,11
MULDER:    And he knew.  He lied.  He knew she was alive and the only reason he's lying now is because she's still alive.  ,7,11
MULDER:    I know. I know.  You don't want me to get my hopes up. I understand that.  ,7,11
MULDER:    (pointing)   We have an E.R. nurse who signed her in.  ,7,11
"MULDER:    I have this... powerful feeling and I can't explain it, but that... this is the end of the road.  That I've been brought here to learn the truth.  ",7,11
MULDER:    Samantha.  ,7,11
MULDER:    End of the road.  ,7,11
MULDER:    He's okay.  It's okay.  ,7,11
"MULDER:    He's dead.  They're all dead, Harold.  Your son, Amber Lynn, and my sister.  ",7,11
"MULDER:    Harold, you see so much but you refuse to see him.  You refuse to let him go.  But you have to let him go now, Harold.  He's protected. He's in a better place.  They're all in a better place.  We both have to let go, Harold.  ",7,11
MULDER:    I'm fine.  ,7,11
MULDER:    I'm free.  ,7,11
MULDER:   FBI!  ,7,12
MULDER:    I got I.D. In my back pocket.  ,7,12
MULDER:    Check the I.D.!  ,7,12
MULDER:    Check my I.D. in the back pocket.  ,7,12
MULDER:    Thank you.  ,7,12
MULDER:    Same case you're working on.  ,7,12
"MULDER:    Not who, what.  ",7,12
MULDER:    I don't know.  ,7,12
MULDER:    See the claw marks here?  Someone tried to get in.  ,7,12
"MULDER:    Deputy?  Deputy, can you describe for me what you saw?  ",7,12
"MULDER:    Well, you must have seen something in order to run away from it, huh?  You were responding to the same call we were-- of a monster prowling the neighborhood.  ",7,12
"MULDER:    Yeah, maybe, but she's not the only one seeing monsters. There's been half a dozen such sightings in this area in the past 60 days. Were you aware of that?  ",7,12
"MULDER:    Yeah.   Also, these sightings only occur on nights when there's a full moon which tells me something.  ",7,12
"MULDER:    What you saw was large, right?  Maybe seven, eight feet tall when it stood up on its two legs?  And it was covered in fur and had glowing red eyes and claws...  ",7,12
MULDER:    Claws sharp enough to gouge the wood off that front door.  ,7,12
"MULDER:    And dare I forget teeth.  It bit you, didn't it?  (grabs WETZEL's wrist)  Look at that.  Deputy, how long were you going to hide that from the E.M.T.S?  ",7,12
MULDER:    (confidently)   A werewolf.  ,7,12
MULDER:    (points to the wrecked police car)   It's what did that.  It also attacked one Hyman Escalara 29 days ago during the last full moon. Hyman died of his wounds in Compton General Hospital but not before giving a detailed description of what attacked him. My partner and I are here to catch it.  ,7,12
"MULDER:    Unfortunately though, Deputy, you've been bitten.  The skin is broken.  Werewolf lore pretty much universally holds that someone who's been bitten by such a creature is going to become such a creature himself, so...  ",7,12
"MULDER:    I'm sorry, but you're going to have to be isolated and kept under guard.  ",7,12
MULDER:    I'm talking about preventing this man from becoming a danger to himself and to others.  ,7,12
MULDER:    (to SERGEANT DUTHIE)   Excuse me.  ,7,12
MULDER:    What is it?  ,7,12
"MULDER:    I don't think it's live television, Scully.  She just said *bleep*.  ",7,12
"MULDER:    I'm clear on that, Scully.  ",7,12
"MULDER:    This presents an opportunity.  I feel we're very close here. The possibility of capturing concrete proof of the paranormal? Of a werewolf in front of a national audience, even an international audience?  What's not to love?  ",7,12
"MULDER:    (laughing)   What career?  Scully, I appreciate it.  You don't want me looking foolish.  I do. I appreciate that.  ",7,12
"MULDER:    Okay, fine.  Well, do me a favor.  Will you escort Deputy Wetzel to the hospital?  Just keep an eye on him in case I'm right?  Thank you.  ",7,12
MULDER:    (unconcerned)   Okay.  ,7,12
"MULDER:    Yeah, all right. Tell her to describe it in detail to the sketch artist. Will you work with her?  ",7,12
"MULDER:    Look at that.  Excuse me.  Look at this.  It's like five claw marks.  Just like the human hand has five fingers.  Pretty much the same spread, too.  ",7,12
MULDER:    I'll show you.  This... this is what Hyman Escalara described just before succumbing to his injuries.  ,7,12
"MULDER:    Ten to one that's what Mrs. Guerrero's going to describe, too.  ",7,12
MULDER:    (looking at the drawing)  This is strange.  ,7,12
MULDER:    This is what she was seeing?  ,7,12
MULDER:    Catch him?  ,7,12
MULDER:    How's Deputy Wetzel?  ,7,12
MULDER:    You let him get released?  ,7,12
MULDER:    Oh.  ,7,12
"MULDER:    (grinning)   So, what did Skinner say?  ",7,12
"MULDER:    Well, if it makes you feel any better, Scully, I'm not entirely convinced that we're looking for a werewolf anymore.  ",7,12
"MULDER:    No, something else.  I'm not sure what.  Some other kind of creature, though.  That I'm sure of.  ",7,12
"MULDER:    Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?  ",7,12
"MULDER:    That's what I was afraid of, Scully.  ",7,12
"MULDER:    Our suspect, apparently.  ",7,12
"MULDER:    Slash marks match up pretty well, wouldn't you say?  ",7,12
MULDER:    Nice color.  ,7,12
"MULDER:    (to the other officers)  Hey, uh...  who called 911 on this?  ",7,12
MULDER:   *The* Steve and Edy?  ,7,12
MULDER:    Did you see anything... that looked like this?  ,7,12
MULDER:    Or this?  ,7,12
"MULDER:    (trying not to laugh)   Well-well, we should may... we should go tal... we'll go talk to Chantara, then.  ",7,12
"MULDER:    So, apparently, we're on the lookout for someone whose hair matches her fingernails-- bubblegum pink.  (smiles and glances over at SCULLY)   That'd be a good color for you, Scully.  ",7,12
"MULDER:    (over his shoulder to the camera)  I'd have to say that at, uh, this point in the investigation I'm-I'm usually a little more secure in-in what it is we're actually investigating but we've had so many conflicting eyewitness reports that it's-it's hard to ascertain exactly what it is we're looking for... (Pause.  Camera focuses on MULDER's fingers tapping the steering wheel. Fuel gauge is low.)  But the crimes we are investigating are-are paranormal. Uh, I can say that... with absolute conviction um, an-and the nature of these crimes they're-they're-they're notoriously hard to quantify on any kind of regular scientific level as Agent Scully will tell you.  ",7,12
"MULDER:    Yeah, which-which in it...  in it... in its own way i-is a... is a kind of a validation if you think about it, in and of itself, uh, but-but, you know, that's-that's our job.  That's why they pay us the big bucks.  ",7,12
MULDER:    Chantara Gomez?  Chantara Gomez.  ,7,12
MULDER:    Chantara Gomez?  ,7,12
MULDER:    Show her your hands.  ,7,12
"MULDER:    Fisher and Belmont-- that's your usual hang, isn't it, Chantara?  ",7,12
"MULDER:    All right, look, I believe you.  I think you saw something. You witnessed something.  Tell me what it is.  ",7,12
"MULDER:    Chantara... if you're afraid that what you tell us we're not going to believe it, don't be 'cause whatever it is you saw tonight... whatever it is, whatever you think you saw however strange or terrifying or bizarre, you are not going to surprise me, okay?  ",7,12
MULDER:    Who's Chuco?  ,7,12
"MULDER:    I'm s... I'm sorry, what?  ",7,12
"MULDER:    No, no, I-I got that.  ",7,12
MULDER:    (to camera)  Chuco.  ,7,12
MULDER:    He's not our guy.  ,7,12
"MULDER:    I don't care how bad his rep is, he can't turn over a squad car.  ",7,12
"MULDER:    No, there's something else going on.  ",7,12
"MULDER:    Yeah, but how long ago?  ",7,12
MULDER:    Maybe Wetzel hit what he was aiming at.  Excuse me.  ,7,12
"MULDER:    Hey, Deputy.  You ready to talk to me now?  You and I both know you saw something.  We're way past claiming you didn't.  ",7,12
"MULDER:    Well, describe it for me.  ",7,12
MULDER:    The wasp man?  ,7,12
"MULDER:    So you're saying that the, uh, the wasp man attacked you both times here, and earlier in the patrol car?  ",7,12
MULDER:    I think maybe it can.  Just... just relax a minute. Excuse me. Scully?  ,7,12
"MULDER:    We came on this case looking for a werewolf, right?  ",7,12
"MULDER:    Hyman Escalara claimed he was attacked by a werewolf and the wounds that he sustained would seem to bear that out, right?  And then, Wetzel over here sees a wasp man with stingers for teeth and he gets a bite mark that you say is irrefutably insect-like, right?  ",7,12
"MULDER:    And then another eyewitness claims she sees Freddy Krueger. Scully, what if we're dealing with one creature, one entity that, when it attacks, appears to you as your worst nightmare?  Fear. Maybe that's what this thing feeds on.  ",7,12
MULDER:    Yeah.  ,7,12
"MULDER:    (thinking)   Probably by... by figuring out how it chooses its prey. I mean, there... It seems to spread like a contagion, doesn't it?  One person's fear becomes the next.  There's a definite chain of victims. Tonight it went from Mrs. Guerrero to Wetzel and the sketch artist and then from the sketch artist to Chantara Gomez and then...  ",7,12
MULDER:    Right.  ,7,12
MULDER:    Who?  ,7,12
"MULDER:    Well, we're back at the home of Steve and Edy.  Thought we'd check on them because they seem to fit a victim profile.  ",7,12
MULDER:    We're not here to get involved in any kind of personal...  ,7,12
MULDER:    We're not here to get involved in personal problems.  ,7,12
MULDER:    Settle down.  ,7,12
MULDER:    (no idea what to say)   Oh. Uh...  ,7,12
"MULDER:    Well, take our word for it.  Because of your proximity to the attack we think you may be targeted as well.  ",7,12
"MULDER:    (emphatically)   No, no. That's not why.  That's not why. I can't really explain it exactly, but it's... I think the key is to remain unemotional, okay?  Try to stay calm.  Try to keep your heart rate down. Try to keep your adrenaline down.  Just try to relax.  Just...  Oh, you got it. You got it.  ",7,12
MULDER:    I think maybe we should stay up for a little while.  Let's just... let's just re-lax.  ,7,12
MULDER:    (perhaps telling himself also)  Just relax.  ,7,12
"MULDER:    How you doing, Edy?  You still upset?  ",7,12
MULDER:    You're scared?  ,7,12
MULDER:    You're not afraid?  ,7,12
"MULDER:    Well, I'd say we should station a couple of deputies out here but I don't think it's coming back here.  We're just playing catch-up with this thing.  It doesn't do what you'd expect.  And, uh, well, we've got four or five hours till the moon sets.  The attacks only occur on the full moon then we're out of luck.  ",7,12
MULDER:    For a possible contagion?  ,7,12
MULDER:    Yeah.  ,7,12
MULDER:    No?  ,7,12
MULDER:    All right.  Make it fast.  Fill that tank up with gas.  ,7,12
"MULDER:    Uh, Deputy, you're the only person who's seen this twice so I'd like to ride with you, if you don't mind.  ",7,12
MULDER:    Thanks.  ,7,12
"MULDER:    Yeah, I believe you.  ",7,12
MULDER:    Why do I believe you?  ,7,12
MULDER:    The camera doesn't always tell the whole story.  ,7,12
MULDER:    I don't think she thinks you're lying.  ,7,12
"MULDER:    I don't know.  Uh, I guess just do good work.  ",7,12
MULDER:    Tell me about it.  ,7,12
MULDER:    You were talking about the hantavirus right before she died?  Why?  ,7,12
MULDER:    She was afraid.  She was afraid... and her fear killed her in the worst possible way that she could imagine.  ,7,12
MULDER:    It's the same.  It's the same M.O.  Same as the others.  What we've been looking for all night.  This-this entity or force somehow vectored off Chantara Gomez to attack this other woman.  ,7,12
"MULDER:    Yeah, but you weren't afraid.  ",7,12
"MULDER:    (softly)  You weren't afraid for your life.  Neither were Steve and Edy and it left them alone.  Mortal fear: I think that's what it comes down to.  This... this... this thing whatever it is, is attracted to that. Everybody who was attacked felt that intensely.  ",7,12
"MULDER:    No, no.  It makes perfect sense.  (to SERGEANT DUTHIE) You said so.  You asked me earlier what would this thing be doing in Willow Park. Well, where else would it go but a high-crime neighborhood? Somewhere where people live behind barred windows and are afraid to go out at night.  Where's Deputy Wetzel?  ",7,12
MULDER:    But I was with him.  I was backing him up.  ,7,12
MULDER:    Wetzel?!  ,7,12
MULDER:    That gun's not going to be any good.  ,7,12
"MULDER:    Well, how come they're not in yet?  ",7,12
MULDER:    If you say so.  ,7,12
MULDER:    (through the closed door)  Where's Wetzel?  ,7,12
MULDER:    Stay where you are.  ,7,12
"MULDER:    Look at this, Scully.  ",7,12
MULDER:    Wetzel?  Wetzel?  ,7,12
MULDER:    Wetzel?  ,7,12
MULDER:    Wetzel?!  ,7,12
"MULDER:    (banging on the door)  Wetzel, don't be afraid.  It can't hurt you! Don't be afraid!  That's what it wants.  Hello?  Wetzel?  It can't hurt you! You're a * bleep* Sheriff's Deputy, Wetzel!  Don't be afraid now. (glancing at the camera)   And you're on national television, so cowboy up!  ",7,12
MULDER:    Geez.  ,7,12
MULDER:    Wetzel?  ,7,12
MULDER:    (looking out the window)   The sun just came up.  ,7,12
MULDER:    Maybe it just went away until the next full moon.  I don't know. You've got to figure there's enough fear in the world that if it doesn't show up in Willow Park it's going to show up someplace else.  ,7,12
"MULDER:    (pointing up at the camera)   Well, hey, you know, it all depends on how they edit it together.  ",7,12
"MULDER:    Agents Mulder and Scully, FBI.  We're expected.  ",7,13

MULDER:    I don't know about you guys but I'd be checking my shorts for cake.  ,7,13
MULDER:    Who was he playing against?  ,7,13
MULDER:    Did anybody see what happened?  ,7,13
MULDER:    (to PHOEBE)   You said you were in the control booth when it happened?  Can you tell me exactly what you saw?  ,7,13
MULDER:    What happened in there?  ,7,13
MULDER:    What about the wireframe?  ,7,13
MULDER:    Can you texture wrap her?  ,7,13

MULDER:    It's all in the computer.  ,7,13
"MULDER:    But she's not in any video game, she's in this one and no one programmed her in.  ",7,13

"MULDER:    (whispering, speechless as he heads for the stairs)   That's Daryl Musashi!  ",7,13
MULDER:    Huh?  ,7,13
MULDER:    Is that him?  Is that Daryl Musashi?  ,7,13
MULDER:    Why is he just standing there?  ,7,13
MULDER:    He hasn't even broken a sweat.  ,7,13

MULDER:    Stupid?  ,7,13
MULDER:    Who says it adds to it?  ,7,13
"MULDER:    Well, that's rather sexist, isn't it?  ",7,13
"MULDER:    I mean, maybe the game provides an outlet for certain impulses, that it fills a void in our genetic makeup that the more civilizing effects of society failed to provide for.  ",7,13
"MULDER:    Well, testosterone frenzy or no the only suspect we have in this man's murder is a woman.  ",7,13
MULDER:    A flintlock pistol--  which would leave a very large entry wound.  ,7,13

"MULDER:    We came, we saw, we conquered.  And if the taste of victory is sweet, the taste of virtual victory is not Sweet 'N Low, nor the bullets made of sugar.  Maybe out past where the imagination ends our true natures lie, waiting to be confronted on their own terms.  Out where the intellect is at war with the primitive brain in the hostile territory of the digital world where laws are silent and rules disappear in the midst of arms.  Born in anarchy with an unquenchable bloodthirst we shudder to think what might rise up from the darkness.  ",7,13
"MULDER:    What do you think, Scully, is this a name, possibly?  Or a code, or an anagram?  ",7,14

"MULDER:    (standing behind her, pointing to the word on the wall)   Except who, then, did this?  Blood pattern doesn't indicate that the good doctor did it, who I am assuming could read and write above a fourth-grade level.  ",7,14
"MULDER:    (whispering mysteriously back at her)   Oh, there is one detail that does.  ",7,14
MULDER:    This.  ,7,14
MULDER:    Dirt.  It's a very powerful component of hexcraft.  As well as the pattern in which it was originally arranged.  Check this out.  ,7,14
MULDER:    Looks like a human form.  ,7,14
"MULDER:    Yeah, that's what it looks like to me.  Now, I know what you're going to say, Scully.  ",7,14
"MULDER:    Dr. Wieder, do you have any enemies?  ",7,14
"MULDER:    I'm sorry, I have to ask. There was a message left behind.  If it doesn't refer to your father-in-law, it may refer to you.  ",7,14
"MULDER:    Hey, Scully.  ",7,14
"MULDER:    This dirt we found?  Gas chromatograph shows pronounced spikes of methane and sulphur compounds - the signature of decay.  It's graveyard dirt.  Also known as conjure dust.  It's one of the most powerful hexing elements whether for good or evil, not the kind of stuff you want to be on the wrong end of.  ",7,14
"MULDER:    (suggestively)  Go ahead, Scully, keep me guessing.  ",7,14
"MULDER:    (laughing)   The, the, the, uh...  the disease that New Guinea tribesmen get?  ",7,14
MULDER:    And I thought my grandpa slurping his soup was bad.  ,7,14
"MULDER:    Kuru makes you crazy, right?  ",7,14
"MULDER:    Unless...  it was inflicted upon him.  The graveyard dirt, the hex.  He was given this disease so that he would kill himself.  ",7,14

MULDER:    The dirt you found in your bed drawn in the shape of a body.  That's indicative of folk magic.  That's what I believe is being used against you.  ,7,14

MULDER:    We're investigating a murder.  That's why I'm asking.  ,7,14
MULDER:    So you could give them any illness you wanted?  One that you chose specifically for them?  ,7,14
MULDER:    How would you counteract one of these?  ,7,14

"MULDER:    Well, I'm thinking of her dear old backwoods Dad and where he gets all his graveyard dirt.  ",7,14
MULDER:    The cultists we spoke to said that the person casting these magic spells was charmed.  That he had a source of power that was very meaningful to him and he kept it close by.  ,7,14
"MULDER:    That's my guess.  So as long as her body remains here resting in peace in the Bay Area, he remains powerful.  But if we were to ship it off to Quantico...  ",7,14

MULDER:   (on phone)    Peattie may be on to us.  ,7,14
"MULDER:   (on phone)    I found out where he lives only he's cleared out, and he's taken his magic charm with him.  At least as much of it as he can carry.  My guess is he's looking for you.  ",7,14
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Just keep an eye out, Scully.  I'm on my way.  ",7,14
"MULDER:    Lynette Peattie's body is on its way back home to Indiola, West Virginia.  ",7,14
MULDER:    Mm-hmm.  It seems pretty clear-cut.  ,7,14

MULDER:    You do keep me guessing.  ,7,14
"MULDER:    Good morning.  Here's a story to warm the cockles of your heart, Scully.  An 11-year-old boy, diagnosed with lymphatic cancer, cured with a miracle.  ",7,15
MULDER:    (speechless)   Ah.  ,7,15
MULDER:    It's not the miracle I'm suspicious of.  It's the messenger. (hands her the sheet of paper)  That came as an anonymous e-mail to me from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.  ,7,15
MULDER:    Someone at DARPA.   (pause)  How'd you hear about it?  ,7,15
MULDER:    You subscribe to the Goochland Guardian?  ,7,15
MULDER:    (watching her)    So this just appeared miraculously on your doorstep this morning?  ,7,15
MULDER:    Someone wants us on this case.  ,7,15
MULDER:    Not yet.   I'm going to go back over to DARPA.  You see what else you can find out about that boy.  ,7,15
MULDER:    I've just got to know whether it was Roma Downey or Della Reese.  ,7,15
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Hey, Scully, it's me.  Pick up if you're there. Scully? Are you there?  All right, I just got, I got your message and I hope everything's okay.  I'll try on your cell right now.  ",7,15

"MULDER:    I don't believe that, either.  Give me that.  ",7,15

"MULDER:    No. She's away from her desk.  I wouldn't just bust in here but, as I said, it's a breaking situation.  ",7,15

"MULDER:    Are you aware of a federal fugitive, code name Cobra? For the past six months Cobra's been e-mailing Scully from the Department of Defense where he works on a shadow project for advanced research.  ",7,15
MULDER:    No. What they're pulling up is Scully's correspondence back to Cobra.  ,7,15
MULDER:    No. Somebody posing as Scully who hacked into her computer and has been capturing all her e-mail.  Passing themselves off as Scully in order to win Cobra's trust.  The last five exchanges hint at a meeting where they're going to exchange information on the project Cobra's working on.  ,7,15
MULDER:    Smoking man.  Or someone working for him.  You got to get to him now.  ,7,15
"MULDER:    Well, if you don't get to him it may be the last time we see Scully alive.  ",7,15
MULDER:    He used you.  ,7,15
MULDER:    You saw what you needed to see in order to make you believe.  ,7,15
"MULDER:    Even if we could convince his parents to let us march him out how long before that chip in his neck mysteriously disappears?  This was the perfectly executed con, Scully.  The only thing I can't figure out is why you're still alive.  ",7,15
"MULDER:    (voice)   He did it all for himself--  to get the science on that disk.  His sincerity was a mask, Scully.  The man's motives never changed.  ",7,15
"MULDER:    (voice)    No, he knows what that science is worth, how powerful it is.  He'd let nothing stand in his way.  ",7,15
MULDER:    No. She'll come.  Matter of time.  ,7,16
MULDER:    Ah...  Six prostitutes were seen with her at Dirty Dames never to be seen again.  Not only might she be a female serial killer--  rare in and of itself-- but twice police raided that club to arrest her ...  ,7,16
MULDER:    She's on tape going in.  The exits are covered.  She's nowhere to be found.  What happens to her?  She disappear... turn invisible?  ,7,16
"MULDER:    That's the job, Scully-- vigilance in the face of privation... the sheer will that it takes to sit in this crappy room spying on the dregs of society until our suspect surfaces.  There's something ennobling in that.  ",7,16
MULDER:   (on phone)    Mulder.   Now?   All right.  ,7,16
MULDER:    I got to go.  ,7,16
"MULDER:    You wanted to see me, sir?  ",7,16
MULDER:    I'm already on a case.  ,7,16
MULDER:    Why? What did I do?  ,7,16
MULDER:    Specifically?  ,7,16
"MULDER:    Well, the, uh... th-the raven is considered a-a very powerful symbol in certain Norse, Celtic and Native American cultures uh, mostly, a negative one.  Indians view it as a deceiving spirit, Christianity mostly associates it with evil and, then, of course, there's Poe's raven and, ""nevermore,"" an-and all that stuff.  ",7,16
"MULDER:    No, really, what did I do?  ",7,16
MULDER:    I'm also assuming that the fact that Martha Crittendon's father is a federal judge also has a little bearing on this case.  ,7,16
MULDER:    Yeah.  ,7,16
MULDER:    Nice to meet you.  ,7,16
"MULDER:    Sure. Uh, I don't know how much help I'm going to be.  I know you already have a lot of good investigators on the case.  So, um... You want to just take a quick look around?  ",7,16
"MULDER:    Great, thanks.  ",7,16
"MULDER:    So, tell me about Martha Crittendon.  ",7,16
"MULDER:    So, what's your theory on what happened?  ",7,16
MULDER:    Her husband was out of town when she disappeared?  ,7,16
MULDER:    What do you know about a raven?  ,7,16
MULDER:    Not necessary.  ,7,16
"MULDER:    You're sure, uh, Martha's last name isn't Stewart?  ",7,16
MULDER:    How many talons would you say a raven had?  ,7,16
MULDER:    Never mind.  ,7,16
MULDER:    You know what this is?  You know what was hanging here?  ,7,16
MULDER:    You had no other signs of struggle?  ,7,16
MULDER:    Sir.  I hope we can help.  ,7,16
"MULDER:    Uh, birth control pills.  ",7,16
MULDER:    Do you have any idea who your wife may have been seeing?  ,7,16
"MULDER:    I wouldn't rule it out, but I doubt it.  ",7,16
MULDER:    According to your Audubon book here a raven has four talons. That matches the scratches we found on Martha Crittendon's mantel.  ,7,16
"MULDER:    (smiling)   No, no. Not... not a raven itself.  But, in folklore, ravens are companions to evil-- evil spirits, witches, warlocks-- that kind of thing.  ",7,16
"MULDER:    Well, there was also a broken mirror in Martha's house. Mirrors are considered items of enchantment.  A broken one  means something.  I'm not exactly sure what it is, but it means something.  ",7,16
MULDER:    Hi.  ,7,16
"MULDER:    No, no, that...  that's not necessary.  ",7,16
"MULDER:    You know, I should really get the Bureau to reimburse you for room and board.  ",7,16
MULDER:    (very surprised)   Really?  ,7,16
MULDER:    Uh... Excuse me.  Sorry.  Thanks.  ,7,16
MULDER:   (on phone)    Mulder.  ,7,16
"MULDER:   (on phone, cheerfully)   Oh, hey, Scully.  How's the stakeout?  ",7,16
MULDER:   (on phone)    Ouch.  I'm sorry to hear that.  ,7,16
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Well, she'll come, you know?  It's just a matter of time.  She'll show up-- I'm sure of that.  ",7,16
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Hey, Scully, tough it out.  Whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger.  Right?  ",7,16
"MULDER:    (to ELLEN)   No, no, no, no.  No capers, thank you.  ",7,16
"MULDER:   (on phone, quickly)    I said, ""What a... what a crazy caper."" I'll talk to you later... and, uh, keep warm.  Bye.  ",7,16
MULDER:    Cheers.  ,7,16
MULDER:    What do you make of these claw marks?  ,7,16
MULDER:    I was going to say.  ,7,16
MULDER:    You okay?  ,7,16
MULDER:    I agree.  ,7,16
MULDER:     I do.  ,7,16
MULDER:    You said the car window shattered after you saw the reflection and there's a broken mirror in Martha's house.  I don't think that's a coincidence.  ,7,16
"MULDER:    Mirrors are considered doorways.  In the Victorian Era, they built mirrored rooms called psychomantiums where they thought they could summon forth spirits from the spirit world.  Denizens from the spirit world were brought into this world.  ",7,16
"MULDER:    Well, you asked about the raven, right?  The raven is a carrion bird attracted to death and decay.  What if this entity that you saw is somehow a personification of that?  What if this creature was brought forth in order to attack Martha?  Then the question becomes, ""who summoned it forth?""  Ellen, do you know if Martha had any enemies?  Can you think of anyone at all who would have wished her harm?  ",7,16
MULDER:    We understand there was no love lost between you and Martha Crittendon.  ,7,16
"MULDER:    Well, let's stay on the subject of you.  On your police record, for instance.  You don't suffer people that don't give you respect.  I'm thinking of that hair salon owner you assaulted.  ",7,16
MULDER:    Where were you the night she disappeared?  ,7,16
"MULDER:    Fair enough, but why did she lie about her alibi?  I got that vibe pretty clear.  ",7,16
MULDER:    Excuse me.  ,7,16
MULDER:    Okay.  ,7,16
MULDER:   (on phone)    Mulder.  ,7,16
MULDER:   (on phone)    I'm sorry. Who is this?  ,7,16
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Well, the view may not be too different here. It's dressed up a little nicer but underneath the surface, it's the same seamy underbelly.  ",7,16
"MULDER:   (on phone)    You know, Scully, this case has turned out to be a little more interesting than I thought and I could use your help.  ",7,16
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Well, there's a murder victim that I'd like you to autopsy for me.  What do you think?  Scully? You still there?  Hello?  ",7,16
MULDER:   (on phone)    What? What did you say?  ,7,16
"MULDER:    Are you feeling a little better, Ellen?  Can you...  just talk to me a little bit about what happened?  ",7,16
MULDER:    It came back-- the... the creature you saw?  ,7,16
MULDER:    I believe she saw something.  ,7,16
MULDER:    What about the two broken mirrors?  ,7,16
MULDER:    That's number six.  It's a match to the one Howard Crittendon found in his wife's coat pocket.  What would this be doing here?  ,7,16
"MULDER:    Ellen, do you recognize this key?  ",7,16
MULDER:    You found it before you were attacked?  ,7,16
"MULDER:    Oh, hey-- good morning.  Good morning, Ellen.  ",7,16
"MULDER:    Wow...  Uh, have you seen my shirt?  I left it...  ",7,16
"MULDER:    Oh.  Oh, Ellen, you-you didn't have to go to the trouble of...  ",7,16
"MULDER:    Well, maybe I should try that sometime.  ",7,16
MULDER:    Thanks.  Yikes.  Wow...  ,7,16
"MULDER:    Well, Phil is living large.  Where is he this morning?  ",7,16
MULDER:    Whoa.  ,7,16
MULDER:    Uh-uh. That's fine.  ,7,16
"MULDER:    Well, that has a vaguely pathetic ring to it.  ",7,16
MULDER:    Oh.  ,7,16
"MULDER:    Um, not in the widely understood definition of that term.  ",7,16
MULDER:    Good morning.  ,7,16
"MULDER:    Eh, I only woke up once, when you went out.  ",7,16
MULDER:    All night?  ,7,16
"MULDER:    Well, I spoke to the coroner this morning and the autopsy shows that Martha Crittendon was four weeks pregnant when she died-- despite her birth control pills.  She probably didn't even know it.  Any idea who the father might be?  I mean, Howard's vasectomy pretty much puts him out of the running. (pause)  Any inkling who it might be?  ",7,16
MULDER:    You have a piece of evidence in your possession that I'd like back-- the skeleton key.  Number six.  ,7,16
MULDER:    You want to tell me what this unlocks?  ,7,16
"MULDER:    Once I find out, we'll talk again.  ",7,16
"MULDER:    Sheriff, you know that talk I said we should have?  ",7,16
"MULDER:    So you were having an affair with both Jenny and Martha Crittendon?  (Sheriff nods slightly)   I got to hand it to you, Sheriff. You put the service back into ""protect and serve.""  ",7,16
MULDER:    They knew about each other?  (another nod)   But I'm assuming Ellen doesn't.  ,7,16
"MULDER:    Well, I think you got bigger problems facing you right now.  ",7,16
MULDER:    I said it was an entity summoned by somebody else ....  ,7,16
MULDER:    Ellen?  Ellen?  ,7,16
MULDER:   (on phone)    Mulder.  ,7,16
MULDER:   (on phone)    You're free?  ,7,16
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Oh, you solved the X-File.  ",7,16
MULDER:   (on phone)    What are you saying?  You didn't catch our blond mystery serial killer?  ,7,16
MULDER:   (on phone)    What are you talking about?  ,7,16
MULDER:    . our noses.  ,7,16
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Well, good work, Scully.  I'll call you back later.  ",7,16
"MULDER:    Ellen?  Ellen, it's Agent Mulder.  ",7,16
"MULDER:    Ellen, Jenny Uphouse is dead.  Your husband is in custody suspected of murdering her only I don't think he did it.  Do you?  ",7,16
"MULDER:    Ellen, you went out this morning after breakfast.  Where'd you go?  ",7,16
"MULDER:    I think it is.  Ellen, I think you have a whole other side that you're afraid to face.  That would explain all the broken mirrors.  You don't want to see yourself for what you really are.  Ellen, you have to come out of there.  ",7,16
"MULDER:    Ellen, you need to open this door.  ",7,16
MULDER:    You want to see her?  ,7,16
MULDER:    I think it's about as close as science can come. I think the basic idea is right.  There are some multiple personality disorders where an alternate personality displays traits that the host doesn't have-- like nearsightedness or high blood pressure or even diabetes.  I think in Ellen's case the changes were just a lot more extreme.  ,7,16
"MULDER:    She wanted so much from her life with you-- a perfect life-- and I think that at some point she found out you were cheating with Jenny and Martha, I don't know when, but at some point she did, and... and, like you said, I think she had to rationalize that.  She just bottled up her anger, swallowed it, and it had to come out some way.  I think she did what she did to protect her family.  ",7,16
"MULDER:    I heard you, Scully.  ",7,17
"MULDER:    Well, what else could she possibly have drowned in?  ",7,17
"MULDER:    Well, I think that demands a little deeper investigation, don't you?  ",7,17
"MULDER:    Well, it doesn't matter.  We got bigger fish to fry.  ",7,17
"MULDER:    Have a seat, Scully.  Check this out.  Is that beautiful or what?  ",7,17
MULDER:    Computer-generated crop circles.  It's a fractal image predicted by a computer program and using data of every known occurrence of the phenomena over the past 40 years.  ,7,17
"MULDER:    What most people don't realize is that, since 1991...  ",7,17
MULDER:    ... there's been a dramatic increase in size and complexity of circle design.  That's when the Mandelbrot Set appeared in England.  ,7,17
MULDER:    A series of geometrically perfect rings appearing almost impossibly overnight in a field near Cambridge.  ,7,17
"MULDER:    But that was merely prelude of what was to come.  Three years later, in 1994 even more complex formations occurred simultaneously on opposite ends of the English countryside with the Mandelbrot Set, were it still there, at its center.  Then, in 1997, even more complex formations occurred...  ",7,17
MULDER:    ... and I'm not wearing any pants right now.  ,7,17
MULDER:    You're not listening.  ,7,17
"MULDER:    The point is is that a computer program has shown us that these are not just random, happenstance coincidental occurrences and that same program has predicted that in just 48 hours even more complex formations are going to be laid down in a field near Avebury--  48 hours, Scully--  but I wouldn't mind getting there earlier if you don't mind.  ",7,17
MULDER:    England - I got two tickets on a 5:30 flight.  ,7,17
"MULDER:    Well, what the hell does that mean?  ",7,17
MULDER:    I'll just cancel your ticket.  ,7,17
MULDER:    Thanks for lunch.  ,7,17
MULDER:    I wouldn't know what I'd be missing.  ,7,17
"MULDER:   (on speaker phone)    Hey, you're there?  ",7,17
MULDER:   (on phone)    Hey.  ,7,17
"MULDER:   (On phone)    I got a 5:30 flight, remember?  ",7,17
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Listen, uh, the reason I called-- am I catching you at a bad time?  ",7,17
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Uh, there's this group in D.C. that is researching crop circles.  They've got a totally different set of coordinates from the one that I got already.  ",7,17
"MULDER:   (on phone)    I got to ask you a favor.  One of the researchers lives out near the hospital and they've got these sensitive photos and data and stuff that they won't fax to me so I was just wondering if you would just, maybe go over there and, you know, and get it and put it in the bureau pouch for me...  ",7,17
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Speak to me, Scully.  ",7,17
"MULDER:   (on phone, shutting down defensively)    Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place?  ",7,17
"MULDER:   (on phone, voice)    I was just about to leave you a message. Listen, I got that, uh, that address that I wanted you to go to for me.  It's a woman you're going to be dealing with.  She's affiliated with The American Taoist Healing Center.  ",7,17
"MULDER:   (on phone, voice)    Don't roll your eyes, Scully.  ",7,17
"MULDER:   (on phone, voice)    Scully?   Scully, you there?  ",7,17
MULDER:    Hey.  ,7,17
MULDER:    I was just looking for you.  ,7,17
MULDER:    I'm back.  ,7,17
MULDER:    (bummed)   Nothing. There was no event.  No crop circles. Big waste of time.  ,7,17
MULDER:    What is that supposed to mean?  ,7,17
MULDER:     I just find it hard to believe.  ,7,17
MULDER:    The part where I go away for two days and your whole life changes.  ,7,17
MULDER:    You speaking to God in a Buddhist temple.  God speaking back.  ,7,17
"MULDER:    Well, for you, that's like saying you're having David Crosby's baby.  ",7,17
MULDER:    What is it?  ,7,17
"MULDER:    I don't think you can know.  I mean, how many different lives would we be leading if we made different choices.  We... We don't know.  ",7,17
"MULDER:    Mmm. And all the... choices would then lead to this very moment.  One wrong turn, and... we wouldn't be sitting here together. Well, that says a lot.  That says a lot, a lot, a lot.  That's probably more than we should be getting into at this late hour.  ",7,17
MULDER:    Who's Cardinal O'Fallon?  ,7,18
"MULDER:    Oh.  I-I don't want to be myopic here, sir, but this looks like a straight up terrorist act for the A.T.F.  ",7,18
MULDER:    Are you going to answer your phone?  ,7,18
MULDER:    Yeah.  ,7,18
"MULDER:    Sir, who the hell is this guy?  ",7,18
"MULDER:    Well, that's actually just a hindrance-slash-pain in the neck.  ",7,18
MULDER:    I've no idea what you just said.  ,7,18
"MULDER:    Sir, have I pissed you off in a way that's more than normal?  ",7,18
"MULDER:    Enough, Wayne.  ",7,18
MULDER:    Cardinal O'Fallon can you think of anyone who might make an attempt on your life?  ,7,18
MULDER:    The size of the bomb would have limited its destruction to just the crypt itself.  Is there anything down there worth targeting?  ,7,18
"MULDER:    Wayne, shut up.  ",7,18
MULDER:    (warning)  Wayne... Shut up.  ,7,18
MULDER:    Who comes down to the crypt here?  ,7,18
"MULDER:    Well, my instinct, Cardinal, is to see this desecration of the dead less as a murder attempt and more as a terrorist act-- a message...  ",7,18
"MULDER:    Excuse me.  (pulls his phone out)   That's, uh, that's not me.  ",7,18
MULDER:    No.  That's Micah Hoffman.  ,7,18
"MULDER:    Micah Hoffman, Willie Mays, and Frank Serpico.  That's my Holy Trinity, Scully.  ",7,18
MULDER:    Yeah. Name a '60s counterculture movement and Micah Hoffman was at or near the center of it.  He was one of the original Weathermen. He was the first Yippie.  He was a better poet than Ginsburg and he was also the starting shortstop for his Columbia baseball team.  ,7,18
"MULDER:    Yeah, right after Altamont.  He was never really heard from again.  ",7,18
MULDER:    This should be it here.  ,7,18
MULDER:    (to SCULLY)   What did Skinner want you for this morning?  ,7,18
MULDER:    Wow.  ,7,18
"MULDER:    I knew, uh, Hoffman was a master potter...  ",7,18
"MULDER:    All right, one more pun and I pull out my gun.  Scully, look at that.  ",7,18
MULDER:    After?  ,7,18
"MULDER:    Well, what would Micah Hoffman be doing with heretical religious texts?  ",7,18
"MULDER:    Shh, shh, shh, shh.  ",7,18
MULDER:    What's that?  ,7,18
MULDER:    Looks like the same gospel of Mary Scully ID'd over at Hoffman's place.  ,7,18
"MULDER:    Well, there is no ""real"" Gospel of Mary, Federman.  The, uh, original would be a fake.  ",7,18
MULDER:    Hmm...  ,7,18
"MULDER:    (chuckling)   Federman, that wasn't a movie.  That was real life.  ",7,18
MULDER:    (amazed)   You're leaving?  You don't want to get to the bottom of this?  ,7,18
"MULDER:    Well, you know, sometimes truth can be stranger than fiction.  ",7,18
"MULDER:    Well, why do you say that?  ",7,18
MULDER:    I miss him already.  ,7,18
MULDER:    The Lazarus bowl?  ,7,18
"MULDER:    Twisted sisters, my kind of nun, you know?  ",7,18
MULDER:    She'd be in prison today.  You realize that.  ,7,18
MULDER:    Lazarus's aunt?  ,7,18
MULDER:    You see? It's just not true that you can't get good science at Catholic school.  It's a lie.  ,7,18
"MULDER:    (smiling at her)   That is a very cool story coming from you, Scully.  I'll have Chuck Burks meet you over at my office see if this clay has Christ's Greatest Hits on it and I'm going... I'm going to go have another audience with Cardinal O'Fallon.  ",7,18
"MULDER:    Can you translate what it says there for me, please?  ",7,18
MULDER:    Yes.  ,7,18
MULDER:    And how about these?  ,7,18
MULDER:    Or rough drafts.  ,7,18
"MULDER:    They're all forgeries, sir.  Did you buy these from Micah Hoffman?  ",7,18
"MULDER:    I can understand that.  Hoffman was a master.  My partner had them analyzed and they're virtually indistinguishable from the real thing. The paper is authentic, the ink, the hand, the diction-- everything.  Hoffman was also an explosives expert.  Do you have any idea what he might have been doing with a bomb in the crypt?  ",7,18
MULDER:    Can you think of anybody who might have wanted to kill Micah Hoffman?  ,7,18
"MULDER:    Why were you hiding the documents, sir?  ",7,18
MULDER:    So you bought them in order to hide them?  ,7,18
MULDER:    Why didn't you just destroy the documents yourself?  ,7,18
"MULDER:    I'd be doing life if it were, sir.  ",7,18
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Hey, uh, Scully, it's me.  Can you horn in on the Hoffman autopsy for me?  ",7,18
MULDER:   (on phone)    I got a feeling Hoffman was dead before he died. He was blackmailing O'Fallon with those forgeries.  Maybe O'Fallon retaliated.  ,7,18
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Oh, hold on a second.  That's my other line.  ",7,18
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Yeah, Mulder.  ",7,18
"MULDER:   (on phone)    I can't really talk about the case, you know.  ",7,18
"MULDER:   (on phone, surprised)    I'm in the movie?  ",7,18
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Yeah, hold on a second, Wayne.  ",7,18
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Hey, Sister Spooky, I've got to take this.  ",7,18
MULDER:   (on phone)    Thanks.  ,7,18
MULDER:   (on phone)    How about Richard Gere?  ,7,18
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Wayne, you're breaking up.  It sounded like you said ""Garry Shandling.""  ",7,18
MULDER:   (on phone)    How do you know about the Lazarus bowl?  ,7,18
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Hey, who's... well, then who's going to play Skinner in the movie?  ",7,18
MULDER:   (on phone)    Ri ... Ri ....  ,7,18
"MULDER:    What'd you find, Scully?  ",7,18
"MULDER:    Man, oh, manischevitz-- communion wine, I bet.  ",7,18
MULDER:    I bet O'Fallon poisoned Hoffman then placed his body near the explosion to cover his tracks.  ,7,18
MULDER:    I could get a warrant for O'Fallon.  ,7,18
"MULDER:    Augustine O'Fallon, you're under arrest for the murder of Micah Hoffman.  You have the right to remain silent.  ",7,18
MULDER:    Anything you say can and will be used against you...  ,7,18
"MULDER:    Yes, I do.  ",7,18
"MULDER:    A bomb went off, a crime's been committed.  There's a dead body nobody seems to give a damn about, O'Fallon's been less than forthcoming and Hoffman, at the very least is guilty of forgery and extortion.  ",7,18
MULDER:    I think this whole Richard Gere thing is going to Skinner's head.  ,7,18
"MULDER:    Chuck, I've had a bad day.  ",7,18
MULDER:    What's the second part?  ,7,18
MULDER:    I am become skeptical.  ,7,18
"MULDER:    Well, I suppose that's a choice every young gifted American male is faced with.  ",7,18
MULDER:    At Columbia.  ,7,18
MULDER:    How did your cell phone get on the dead man in the crypt?  ,7,18
"MULDER AND TV:    Well, as long as they can think we'll have our problems. But those whom we are using cannot think they are the dead brought to assimilated life by our electrode...  ",7,18
MULDER:    It's open.  ,7,18
"MULDER AND TV:   You know, it's an interesting thing when you consider the earth people who can think... ...  ",7,18
"MULDER:    Couldn't sleep either, huh?  ",7,18
"MULDER:    Yeah.  It's the Ed Wood investigative method.  This movie is so profoundly bad in such a childlike way that it hypnotizes my conscious critical mind and frees up my right brain to make associo-poetic leaps and I started flashing on Hoffman and O'Fallon.  How there's this archetypal relationship like Hoffman's Jesus to O'Fallon's Judas or Hoffman's Jesus to O'Fallon's Dostoyevsky's Grand Inquisitor, or Hoffman's Jesus to O'Fallon's St. Paul.  ",7,18
MULDER:    Yeah?  ,7,18
MULDER:    Are you making fun of me?  ,7,18
"MULDER:    Well, no, I don't.  But crazy people can be very persuasive.  ",7,18
MULDER:    Are you directing that at me?  ,7,18
"MULDER:    Well, you know, even a broken clock is right 730 times a year.  ",7,18
MULDER:    (answering the question before she asks)   42.  ,7,18
MULDER:    Yes.  ,7,18
"MULDER:    You know, Scully, we've got four weeks probation vacation and nothing to do and Wayne Federman's invited us out to L.A. to watch his movie being filmed and God knows I could use a little sunshine.  ",7,18
MULDER:    Scully...  ,7,18
MULDER:    Nice to meet you.  ,7,18
MULDER:    Big fan.  Fox Mulder.  ,7,18
MULDER:    Hi.  ,7,18
MULDER:    Sure.  ,7,18
MULDER:    What do you...  What do you mean?  ,7,18
MULDER:    (thinks about it)   Uh...  I guess mostly to the left.  ,7,18
MULDER:    (clarifying)   Most of the time.  ,7,18
MULDER:    Mm-hmm.  ,7,18
MULDER:   (on phone)    Hello?  ,7,18
"MULDER:   (on phone)    I'm, uh, working at the, uh, computer.  What are you doing?  ",7,18
"MULDER:   (on phone)    You know, Scully, I was just thinking about Lazarus, Ed Wood, and those tofurkey-eating zombies.  How come when people come back from the dead they always want to hurt the living?  ",7,18
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Party pooper.  Well, I got a new theory.  I say that when zombies try to eat people, that's just the first stage.  You see, they've just come back from being dead so they're going to do all the things they miss from when they were alive.  So, first, they're going to eat, then they're going to drink, then they're going to dance and make love.  ",7,18
MULDER:   (on phone)    Exactly.  ,7,18
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Hold on a second, that's my other line.  ",7,18
MULDER:   (on phone)    Hello?  ,7,18
"MULDER:   (on phone)    No, sir, I'm just at the, uh, computer.  ",7,18
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Oh.  I appreciate that, Skinman.  ",7,18
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Yes, sir.  Um... Uh, where are you now?  ",7,18
"MULDER:   (on phone)    A.P. Skinner, huh?  ",7,18
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Uh...  So what are you up to right now, sir?  ",7,18
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Uh, hold on just one second, sir.  ",7,18
"MULDER:   (on phone, grinning with delight)    Hey, Scully, Skinman is calling me from a bubble bath.  ",7,18
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Uh, sir, well, hold on one second, sir.  ",7,18
MULDER:   (on phone)    Scully?  ,7,18
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Yeah, Skinner is calling me from a bubble bath.  ",7,18
MULDER:   (on phone)    Totally.  ,7,18
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Oh, yeah, right.  Like Tea Leoni's ever going to have a crush on me.  ",7,18
MULDER:   (on phone)    Really?  ,7,18
"MULDER:   (loudly)   That's it, Scully, I can't take it anymore.  ",7,18
"MULDER:    (sadly)   They got it so wrong, Scully.  ",7,18
"MULDER:    It's Jesus and Judas, Scully.  ",7,18
"MULDER:    No, no, it's just beginning.  Hoffman and O'Fallon were these complicated, flawed, beautiful people and now they'll just be remembered as jokes because of this movie.  The character based on O'Fallon is listed in the credits as ""Cigarette-Smoking Pontiff.""  How silly is that?  ",7,18
"MULDER:    Yeah, what about us?  How are we going to be remembered now 'cause of this movie?  ",7,18
MULDER:    What about all the dead people who are forever silent and can't tell their stories anymore?  They're all going to have to rely on Hollywood to show the future how we lived and it'll all become... oversimplified and trivialized and Cigarette-Smoking Pontificized and become as plastic and meaningless as this stupid plastic Lazarus Bowl.  ,7,18
"MULDER:    The dead are everywhere, Scully.  ",7,18
MULDER:    I bet he was...  ,7,18
MULDER:    What's that?  ,7,18
"MULDER:    Ah... Me, too.  ",7,18
MULDER:    Rough night?  ,7,19
MULDER:    What can you tell us about him?  ,7,19
MULDER:    Can't blow the whistle with a mouth like that.  ,7,19
"MULDER:    Well, if it was acid in the face he would have screamed bloody murder.  ",7,19
MULDER:    Huh.  ,7,19
MULDER:    There's no ashtrays.  Dr. Scobie and his wife don't smoke?  ,7,19
"MULDER:    A tobacco employee that doesn't smoke--  Isn't that kind of like a GM executive who drives a Ford?  If this was a hit it seems unnecessarily high-profile.  It kind of draws attention to itself, don't you think?  ",7,19
MULDER:    You mind if I tag along?  ,7,19
MULDER:    Really? No hard feelings that he was about to turn federal witness against your company?  ,7,19
MULDER:    I'm sure she'll take comfort in finding out why her husband died.  ,7,19
MULDER:    Dr. Voss...  can you tell me what that is?  ,7,19
MULDER:    We found it at Jim Scobie's house.  ,7,19
"MULDER:    (sarcastically)    I'm sorry, I can't.  Answering that question would violate FBI confidentiality due to the sensitive nature of our investigation.  ",7,19
MULDER:    Smoke 'em if you got 'em.  ,7,19
MULDER:    What?  ,7,19
"MULDER:    Well, not necessarily.  There weren't any signs of struggle in the room. Maybe no one was ever there.  ",7,19
"MULDER:    Well, that this isn't a homicide.  You... examined the body Scully.   Did you... find any of these?  ",7,19
"MULDER:    Well, it's a, tobacco beetle, yeah.  ",7,19
MULDER:    I don't know but judging from Dr. Voss's reaction to this I think it's the thing we should investigate.  ,7,19
"MULDER:    Guests check in, but they don't check out.  ",7,19
MULDER:    Probably nothing.  ,7,19
MULDER:    That Jim Scobie wasn't murdered.  Neither was this man.  ,7,19
MULDER:    These.  ,7,19
MULDER:    But there was an open window through which they could have escaped.  ,7,19
MULDER:    FBI.  ,7,19
MULDER:    Sorry to wake you.  ,7,19
MULDER:    Thank you.  We're investigating the death of a man who lived right next to you-- a Thomas Gastall.  Do you know him?  ,7,19
MULDER:    He yelled?  ,7,19
MULDER:    No.  You don't seem surprised that he's dead.  ,7,19
"MULDER:    What is your name, sir?  ",7,19
"MULDER:    Mr. Weaver, did you see or hear anything unusual last night?  ",7,19
MULDER:    Other than that?  ,7,19
"MULDER:    The FBI would appreciate your voluntary cooperation, sir.  That's the way it works.  ",7,19
"MULDER:    That's my card.  Thank you, Mr. Weaver.  ",7,19
MULDER:    Anything?  ,7,19
MULDER:    Good. Talk to her.  ,7,19
MULDER:    See about something else that's been bugging me.  ,7,19
MULDER:    Mrs. Voss?  ,7,19
MULDER:    Fox Mulder.  Is your husband home?  ,7,19
"MULDER:    I understand your reluctance to talk, sir.  You have a nice family-- a lot to lose.  ",7,19
MULDER:    There's been another victim-- Thomas Gastall.  Died exactly the same way Scobie did.  ,7,19
"MULDER:    Well, we found these all over him.  I believe that that's what killed both men.  ",7,19
"MULDER:    I... I understand that, but... maybe these don't.  ",7,19
"MULDER:    No.  But why are you hiding behind your lawyers, doctor?  How many people have to die before you do the right thing?  ",7,19
MULDER:    Talking to lawyers over at Justice.  Trying to get a look at Morley's files.  ,7,19
MULDER:    Mmm.  It must be bad.  ,7,19
MULDER:    Like a dust buster attacked me.  ,7,19
"MULDER:    Mr. ""E pluribus""  ",7,19
MULDER:    (turning to face her)   Beats the alternative.  ,7,19
MULDER:    What about Darrel Weaver?  ,7,19
MULDER:    It was the nicotine itself that was keeping him alive?  ,7,19
MULDER:    (smiling)   It's good for killing tobacco beetles.  ,7,19
MULDER:    That's not all it did.  ,7,19
MULDER:    I bought these on the way to work.  ,7,19
"MULDER:    Well, they say the addiction is stronger than heroin.  ",7,19
MULDER:    I'll be right up.  ,7,19
MULDER'S VOICE:   Betty Templeton?  ,7,20
MULDER'S VOICE:   We're with the FBI.  We'd like to ask about an incident-- a possible religious hate crime in your neighborhood.  ,7,20
MULDER'S VOICE:   They were beaten to within an inch of their lives by each other after visiting the home of a woman living a few blocks over.  ,7,20
"MULDER'S VOICE:   Are you a practitioner of the occult, Miss Templeton? Wicca? Voodoo?  Satanism?  The black art of bodily bilocation?  ",7,20
"MULDER:    This is an FBI fleet sedan from our Kansas City field office requisitioned by two seasoned agents there driven into a tree at 43 miles an hour by the female agent in a novel effort to kill her male counterpart. Now, you might think I'm going to suggest psychokinesis-- pk-- someone or something controlling the agents with remote, mind-bending power.  ",7,20
MULDER:    Both agents sustained critical injuries.  Their stories eerily similar ...  ,7,20
MULDER:    ... as if they temporarily lost control of their minds unable to alter their behavior.  ,7,20
"MULDER:    You may think that I'm going to say it's past lives unresolved or fate, stalking the agents like an animal ...  ",7,20
"MULDER:    No, the interesting thing about these agents is they had worked together for seven years previously without any incident.  ",7,20
"MULDER:    Yeah, but they are not ... romantically involved if that's what you're thinking.  ",7,20
"MULDER:    You have any ideas, Scully, any thoughts?  ",7,20
MULDER:    (finger to his mouth)   Hmm...  ,7,20
MULDER:    (pouting)   Don't go thinking I'm going to start doing the autopsies.  ,7,20
"MULDER:    (voice)   Mr. Zupanic, it's the FBI.  ",7,20
"MULDER:    (voice)   It's the FBI, Mr. Zupanic.  Open up.  ",7,20
MULDER:    Bert Zupanic?  ,7,20
"MULDER:    We're hoping you can help us find the whereabouts of a woman we think you're familiar with, a Betty Templeton.  ",7,20
MULDER:    You know what I'm thinking?  ,7,20
MULDER:    I'm thinking that Bert Zupanic really truly doesn't know Betty Templeton.  ,7,20
"MULDER:    Hey, Scully!  ",7,20
MULDER:    I want you to meet a buddy of mine.  It's Mr. Argyle Sapersteen.  ,7,20
"MULDER:    Saperstein, excuse me.  ",7,20
"MULDER:    This is my partner, Dana Scully.  ",7,20
"MULDER:    Not solved it, but I have narrowed down the search for our perpetrator with the kind help of Mr. Saperstein here.  ",7,20
"MULDER:    Our mystery woman is indeed involved with Mr. Bert Zupanic, the man we spoke to at his hotel, who will be fighting here two days hence with the mystery woman almost undoubtedly in attendance.  ",7,20
"MULDER:    Well, there's lots to do here, and the barbecue's second to none right, Mr. Saperstein?  Plus Mr. Saperstein's going to show me some in-your-face, smack-down moves so I can quit getting my ass kicked so often, right?  Oh, and there's an art exhibit that traces the influence of Soviet art on the American pop culture, right?  Unless, of course you've already found Betty Templeton.  ",7,20
MULDER:    Who's Lulu Pfeiffer?  ,7,20
MULDER:    Sholom alecheim.  ,7,20
MULDER:    Did you lose something?  ,7,20
MULDER:    (showing badge)   Excuse me.  FBI.  ,7,20
"MULDER:    Yes, I'm looking for...  ",7,20
MULDER:    ... that girl.  ,7,20
MULDER:    Betty Templeton?  ,7,20
MULDER:    I think we both know why I'm here.  ,7,20
MULDER:    Lulu Pfeiffer.  ,7,20
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Hey, Scully.  I found her at Koko's Copy Center.  ",7,20
MULDER:   (on phone)    Yeah.  She says that Lulu Pfeiffer's trying to ruin her life.  She follows her wherever she goes.  ,7,20
MULDER:   (on phone)    That's exactly what Betty said.  ,7,20
"MULDER:   (on phone)    I don't know, Scully.  You're running this show. Why don't you tell me?  ",7,20
"MULDER:   (on phone)    No (static), Sherlock.  Hey, Scully, uh...  where's Lulu?  ",7,20
"MULDER:   (on phone)    She wouldn't be driving a little blue convertible, would she?  ",7,20
"MULDER:    Oh, crap.  ",7,20
MULDER:   (on phone)    Yeah.  ,7,20
MULDER:   (on phone)    Seeing a side of Kansas City few men have the privilege to see.  ,7,20
MULDER:   (on phone)    I got sucked into a storm drain.   The more pressing question is what the hell happened to Betty Templeton and Lulu Pfeiffer?  ,7,20
MULDER:   (on phone)    You've located him?  ,7,20
MULDER:   (on phone)    And he's given you insight?  ,7,20
MULDER:   (on phone)    Not as angry as those two women are going to be when they both realize they're in love with the one and only Bert Zupanic.  ,7,20
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Yeah, they're both in love with him.  That's why they're both staying in Kansas City and they won't leave.  ",7,20
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Look, Scully, I don't know.  You're the one who's supposed to have all the answers.  Somebody's got to get to that fight and keep those two women apart or else this time the (static) is going to hit the fans.  ",7,20
MULDER:    Betty Templeton.  My name is Fox Mulder.  I'm with the FBI. Can you come with me?  ,7,20
"MULDER:    (firmly)   Don't make me have to remove you, ma'am.  ",7,20
MULDER:    Mm-hmm.  Mmmm.  ,7,20
MULDER:    Can I get you some coffee?  Water? Anything?  ,7,21
MULDER:    Morning.  ,7,21
"MULDER:    Special Agent Dana Scully, this is, uh, this is Jay Gilmore.  ",7,21
"MULDER:    Mr. Gilmore came all the way to see us from Missouri, the ""Show Me"" state.  ",7,21
"MULDER:    It's okay.  Uh, this is Mr. Gilmore's... situation.  This condition came on very suddenly about a month ago.  ",7,21
"MULDER:    Anson Stokes is a former employee at the, uh, self-storage yard that Mr. Gilmore owns.   Uh, apparently, there was some bad blood between you two.  ",7,21
"MULDER:    Yeah. And then Mr. Gilmore was, uh... stricken...  ",7,21
"MULDER:    Stricken... stricken, and Anson Stokes was nowhere to be found.  He resurfaced several days later and the police wanted to question him.  But he refused.  ",7,21
"MULDER:    Well, and to be fair, sir, they didn't-- they don't.  ",7,21
MULDER:    I know-- this may not be a crime and this guy Stokes may not know anything about it.  ,7,21
"MULDER:    Yeah, but that takes months to develop, right?  It doesn't just happen in the blink of an eye.  (puts his hand on her shoulder steering her toward the sidewalk) Gilmore's surgeons are stumped.  They're writing it up in the New England Journal of Medicine.  ",7,21
"MULDER:    That's a nose, Scully; we're talking mouth here.  ",7,21
"MULDER:    Well, maybe, but I still want to know why Anson Stokes doesn't want to talk to the police.  ",7,21
MULDER:    A little bit.  ,7,21
"MULDER:    Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.  What's your name?  ",7,21
"MULDER:    Oh, you're Anson's brother?  ",7,21
"MULDER:    Hi, there.  ",7,21
"MULDER:    We're not here to talk about the boat, Leslie.  We want to talk to your brother about his former employer.  Mr. Gilmore?  ",7,21
MULDER:    Now I see what's going on here.  ,7,21
"MULDER:    Well, I don't smell any weird chemical smells.  (looks at SCULLY's mouth)   You still have both your lips.  ",7,21
MULDER:    Hey...  1978. (he holds up an old calendar)   It's been a long time since any of this stuff has seen the light of day.  ,7,21
"MULDER:    Oh, well, you want to hit some yard sales while we're out here?  ",7,21
MULDER:    What's your point?  ,7,21
MULDER:    Like what?  ,7,21
MULDER:    And winds up with the Titanic in his driveway?  ,7,21
MULDER:    That still doesn't explain what happened to Gilmore.  ,7,21
"MULDER:    Hey, Scully, check this out.  ",7,21
MULDER:    This woman look familiar to you?  ,7,21
MULDER:    That's the young- woman from the trailer.  How many centuries now has disco been dead?  ,7,21
MULDER:    I think you missed a spot here.  I can see straight through to his ass.  ,7,21
"MULDER:    This is Anson Stokes, huh?  ",7,21
MULDER:    And he's invisible.  ,7,21
"MULDER:    It is amazing, but I don't think it has anything to do with science. Remember Mr. Saturday Night Fever?  ",7,21
"MULDER:    I did a little background checking.  His real name is Henry Flanken.  He redefined the term ""overnight success.""  In 1977, his net worth was $36,000, and in 1978 it was $30 million.  Then there is the interesting way in which Mr. Flanken died.  ",7,21
MULDER:    Chronic morbid tumescence.  ,7,21
"MULDER:    Sch-wing.  On April 4, 1978, he was admitted to Gateway Memorial Hospital with an extreme priapic condition.  Apparently, he was quite the specimen. They had to raise the doorframe in order to wheel him into his hospital room.  ",7,21
"MULDER:    Well, I think our mystery woman is the link.  About whom I can find no information whatsoever.  I think she's responsible for all of this.  ",7,21
MULDER:    I... I don't know.  But... we need to talk to her.  ,7,21
MULDER:    Okay.  ,7,21
MULDER:    I'm very sorry for your loss.  ,7,21
"MULDER:    No, I don't think he suffered.  The part about him being invisible-- that doesn't, uh, catch you off guard just a little bit?  ",7,21
"MULDER:    Leslie, there was a woman here earlier.  Where is she now?  ",7,21
"MULDER:    Uh, let me tell you where I'm going with this.  I think that woman is a jinniyah.  Are you familiar with that term?  ",7,21
MULDER:    It's the feminine for jinni-- as in a demon or spirit from Middle Eastern folklore.  ,7,21
"MULDER:    Yeah, except Barbara Eden never killed anybody.  All right, now in Arabic mythology they speak of these beings that are composed of flame or air but take human form.  They can perform certain tasks or grant certain wishes.  They live in inanimate objects like a lamp or a ring.  Is this beginning to sound familiar?  ",7,21
"MULDER:    Leslie, I believe your brother found just such an object in the storage facility, didn't he?  He took possession of the jinniyah and he made some pretty outrageous requests, like Jay Gilmore's mouth and the yacht in the driveway.  ",7,21
"MULDER:    I do.  And, Leslie, for your own safety-- so that what happened to your brother doesn't happen to you-- I think you should hand over that object to me right now.  ",7,21
MULDER:    (reassuringly)   You're doing the right thing.  ,7,21
"MULDER:    Hey, Scully, come check this out.  ",7,21
"MULDER:    Come on, he's not going anywhere. Come on.  ",7,21
"MULDER:    It's not what I hoped it would be.  Judging from the odor coming inside, I think it's where the Stokes brothers keep their weed.  ",7,21
MULDER:    But that's not what I wanted to show you.  Recognize him?  ,7,21
MULDER:    How about her?  ,7,21
"MULDER:    Well, the computer says it is her.  I ran her through Quantico's facial recognition software and couldn't come up with a match in the known felon database. Then I took a flier and checked with the image bank at the national archives.  Voila.  ",7,21
"MULDER:    Or Richard Nixon, for that matter.  ",7,21
MULDER:    I don't know.  Except that they're both men who got all the power they ever wished for and then lost it.  ,7,21
MULDER:    (her moral support  he's been here)   You saw it.  It was real.  ,7,21
MULDER:    I don't think that's why the body disappeared.  ,7,21
MULDER:    I think it was the result of a wish being granted.  ,7,21
"MULDER:    Well, who would want Anson Stokes back?  I mean, really, really back.  ",7,21
"MULDER:    Would you mind removing your eyewear, ma'am?  ",7,21
MULDER:    Ah.  Do you have a name?  ,7,21
"MULDER:    How about if I call you Jenn? That's short for ""jinniyah.""  ",7,21
"MULDER:    Leslie Stokes and his brother, Anson.  ",7,21
"MULDER:    Well, one thing I haven't been able to figure out is whether you're a good jinni or an evil one.  Everybody you come in contact with seems to meet a bad end.  ",7,21
"MULDER:    Well, possibly evil.  Possibly cursed.  A curse to others.  ",7,21
MULDER:    You mean making the wrong wishes.  ,7,21
MULDER:    You been out of circulation a long time.  ,7,21
MULDER:    What was your third wish?  ,7,21
MULDER:    And thus became a jinni yourself.  ,7,21
MULDER:    I get three wishes.  ,7,21
"MULDER:    I don't think she knows what to make of you.  I don't think I do either, really.  ",7,21
MULDER:    Mmmm.  ,7,21
MULDER:    Well...  ,7,21
MULDER:    What would your wish be if you were in my place?  ,7,21
"MULDER:    But, I just...  you know, I'd like to know.  ",7,21
"MULDER:    You know, I think I'm beginning to see the problem here.  You say that most people make the wrong wishes, right?  ",7,21
MULDER:    This is because they make their wishes solely for personal gain.  ,7,21
"MULDER:    So the trick would be to make a wish that's totally altruistic.  That's for everyone.  So, um...  I wish for peace on earth.  ",7,21
MULDER:    What the hell's wrong with that?  You can't do it?  ,7,21
"MULDER:    Oh, crap.  ",7,21
MULDER:    I guess I should have seen this coming!   (concerned)   Scully.  ,7,21
MULDER:    Scully?  ,7,21
MULDER:    Hello?  Hello?  ,7,21
"MULDER:    (applauding sarcastically)   Very good.  Jinni?  Jinni, whatever the hell your name is...  ",7,21
MULDER:    What the hell is this?  ,7,21
MULDER:    You know damn well that's not what I meant.  ,7,21
MULDER:    This has nothing to do with specificity.  You don't have to wipe out the entire population of the whole planet just to effect a little peace on earth and goodwill towards men.  ,7,21
MULDER:    (defensively)   Did I say that?  I didn't say that.  ,7,21
"MULDER:    Yes, I do, since you butchered the intent of that wish so completely.  And another thing-- I think you've got a really horrible attitude.  I guess that comes from being rolled up in a rug for the last 500 years.  ",7,21
MULDER:    But we're not all that stupid.  We're not all chimpanzees with revolvers.  I think there's another possibility here and that's just that you're a bitch.  ,7,21
MULDER:    Sir.  ,7,21
MULDER:    (extremely embarrassed)  Uh...  ,7,21
"MULDER:    Well, I have to be with you.  I'm going to get this last wish perfect.  I'm not going to leave you any loopholes.  I'm not going to let you interpret this as an edict to bring back the Third Reich or to make everyone's eyes grow on stalks.  ",7,21
MULDER:    You don't remember disappearing off the face of the earth for about an hour this morning?  ,7,21
"MULDER:    Well, I guess everything's okay.  ",7,21
MULDER:    Boink!  ,7,21
"MULDER:    Scully, it is what it is.  You examined an invisible body, remember?  ",7,21
MULDER:    (rolling his head in frustrated disgust)   Oh!  ,7,21
"MULDER:    The trick is to be specific.  To make the wish perfect.  That way, everyone is going to benefit.  It's going to be a safer world, a happier world.  There's going to be food for everyone, freedom for everyone, the end of the tyranny of the powerful over the weak.  Am I leaving anything out?  ",7,21
MULDER:    Then what's the problem?  ,7,21
"MULDER:    Yeah, I'm ready.  ",7,21
MULDER:    I can't believe you don't want butter on your popcorn.  Uggh. It's un- American.  ,7,21
MULDER:    It's a classic American movie.  ,7,21
"MULDER:    Okay, when you invite me over to your place we can watch Steel Magnolias.  ",7,21
MULDER:    I don't know.  Just felt like the thing to do.  Cheers.  ,7,21
"MULDER:    I don't know if you noticed but, um, I never made the world a happier place.  ",7,21
MULDER:    Is that a lot?  ,7,22
MULDER:    (deadpan)   We could start sharing rooms.  ,7,22
MULDER:    You can't really compare what we do to other departments in the Bureau.  ,7,22
"MULDER:    Well, there's more to it than that.  ",7,22
"MULDER:    (defensive)   That's the reason I got started, yeah.  ",7,22
MULDER:    Nothing has been resolved exactly.  ,7,22
MULDER:    Yeah.  ,7,22
MULDER:    You said you were finished.  ,7,22
MULDER:    I'm missing your point.  ,7,22
MULDER:    That sounds more like a threat.  ,7,22
"MULDER:    I can't do my job from an office, I promise you.  ",7,22
MULDER:    I'm not looking in outer space.  ,7,22
MULDER:    To where?  ,7,22
MULDER:    I think I'm in big trouble.  ,7,22
"MULDER:    Yeah, but I never actually assaulted an auditor before.  ",7,22
MULDER:    I reduced his vision a little bit.  ,7,22
MULDER:    (into phone)   Mulder.  ,7,22
MULDER:    (into phone)   Speaking.  ,7,22
"MULDER:    Oregon, seven years ago.  You had multiple abduction experiences.  I'm here with Agent Scully.  ",7,22
"MULDER:    (into phone)    It happening again, Billy?  ",7,22
"MULDER:    (tempting)   More alien abductions, Scully.  ",7,22
MULDER:    We'd probably turn up nothing.  ,7,22
MULDER:    Look who's wearing a badge.  ,7,22
"MULDER:    You've never, um...  have you ever been able to get over the abductions?  ",7,22
MULDER:    Does he deny that it's happening now?  ,7,22
MULDER:    You find the UFO and he won't be able to deny the truth.  ,7,22
MULDER:    Crash of an unidentified craft.  ,7,22
MULDER:    Deja vu all over again.  ,7,22
MULDER:    To mark an anomalous electrical disturbance-- the kind where time gets bent or goes missing or where your car loses power and dies in the middle of the road.  ,7,22
"MULDER:    So, was the deputy's car up there sitting there without his lights on?  ",7,22
MULDER:    Good point.  ,7,22
MULDER:    Probably nothing.  ,7,22
"MULDER:    (subtle sarcasm)   Nothing's all you seem to find out here, Detective.  ",7,22
MULDER:    You're Teresa?  Teresa Nemman?  ,7,22
MULDER:    Seven years ago you came to Agent Scully and I for help.  You were afraid of being abducted.  ,7,22
MULDER:    We had no idea you were his wife.  ,7,22
"MULDER:    He's an abductee, too?  ",7,22
MULDER:    Who is it?  ,7,22
"MULDER:    What's wrong, Scully?  You look sick.  ",7,22
MULDER:    Come in.  ,7,22
MULDER:    You want me to call a doctor?  ,7,22
"MULDER:    It's not worth it, Scully.  ",7,22
MULDER:    I want you to go home.  ,7,22
"MULDER:    No, I've been thinking about it.  Looking at you tonight, holding that baby... knowing everything that's been taken away from you.  A chance for motherhood and your health and that baby.  I think that...  I don't know, maybe they're right.  ",7,22
"MULDER:    The FBI.  Maybe what they say is true, though for all the wrong reasons. It's the personal costs that are too high.  ",7,22
MULDER:    There so much more you need to do with your life.  There's so much more than this.  ,7,22
"MULDER:    (whisper)   There has to be an end, Scully.  ",7,22
"MULDER:    What happened, Billy?  ",7,22
MULDER:    Scully...  the floor.  What do you see?  ,7,22
MULDER:    The same thing as out on the road.   You've seen it before.  ,7,22
"MULDER:    Hey.  Hey, what are you doing?  ",7,22
MULDER:    You know this guy?  ,7,22
MULDER:    Relax. Slow down.  ,7,22
MULDER:    And then what happened?  ,7,22
MULDER:    Scully?  ,7,22
MULDER:    Scully?  ,7,22
MULDER:    Scully.  ,7,22
MULDER:    You want some water?  ,7,22
MULDER:    Can you just get her some water?  ,7,22
"MULDER:    Here, lie still.  ",7,22
MULDER:    It's okay. It's okay.  ,7,22
"MULDER:    I don't know.  But these aren't just random abductions, Scully.  We've got to warn Billy Miles of that.  ",7,22
MULDER:    These abductees aren't just systematically being taken.  They're not coming back.  ,7,22
MULDER:    Billy?  ,7,22
"MULDER:    What's our punishment this time?  Thumbscrews or 40 lashes?  Come on in, Walter.  Sit a spell.  This could be the last time you take a trip down to these offices.  ",7,22
"MULDER:    Guilty as charged.  And if they're coming down on you for that, then I'm sorry.  I truly am.  ",7,22
"MULDER:    (bitterly)   Oh well yeah, stick to a budget they say your making a contribution, but push the limits of your profession, and they say you're out of control.  ",7,22
"MULDER:    Well, we didn't bring home a flying saucer  or an alien.  ",7,22
MULDER:    (challenging)   Here or you want to step outside.  ,7,22
MULDER:    There's no ship in those woods.  ,7,22
MULDER:    Who?  ,7,22
MULDER:    Why me and why now  ,7,22
"MULDER:    If it is, or if it isn't I want you to forget about it, Scully.  ",7,22
MULDER:    (firmly)   You're not going back out there.  I'm not going to let you go back out there.  ,7,22
MULDER:    It has to end sometime.  That time is now.  ,7,22
"MULDER:    Scully, you have to understand that they're taking abductees.  You're an abductee.  I'm not going to risk...  ",7,22
MULDER:    . losing you.  ,7,22
"MULDER:    There's no such thing as a snipe, sir.  ",7,22
MULDER:    I know that.  ,7,22
"MULDER:    Not exactly sure, sir. But, uh...  ",7,22
"MULDER:     budgetarily, I'd say we're looking pretty good.  ",7,22
MULDER:    They're taking abductees.  You're an abductee.  ,8,1
MULDER:    (yelling)   Scully!   Scully!  ,8,2
MULDER:  What are these?  ,8,8
MULDER:    There you are.  I've been looking all over for you.  ,8,8
MULDER:    Is anything the matter?  ,8,8
MULDER:    Mmm.  Then what's wrong?  ,8,8
MULDER:    Don't make me guess.  ,8,8
"MULDER:    Scully, there's, um, there's something I haven't told you either and I hope you, uh, forgive me and understand why I would have kept it from you.  ",8,8
MULDER:    During my investigation into your illness I found out the reason why you were left barren.  Your ova were taken from you and stored in a government lab.  ,8,8
MULDER:    I-I took them directly to a specialist who would tell me if they were okay.  ,8,8
"MULDER:    Scully, you were deathly ill, and I... I couldn't bear to give you another piece of bad news.  ",8,8
MULDER:    The doctor said that the ova weren't viable.  ,8,8
MULDER:    Hi.  ,8,8
MULDER:    Thanks.  ,8,8
"MULDER:    No, I can't stay.  I gotta get back to the office for a while.  ",8,8
"MULDER:    Um, it's... it's not something that I get asked to do every day.  Um, but I am absolutely flattered.  ",8,8
"MULDER:    No, honestly.  ",8,8
"MULDER:    See what's weird is... this sounds, and this sounds really weird, I know, but I, I just wouldn't want this to come between us.  ",8,8
"MULDER:    Well  ... the answer is ""yes.""  ",8,8
"MULDER:    At that part, I'm a pro.  ",8,8
MULDER:    I'm Dr. Miryum.  These are the best team of obstetricians one could hope to assemble. Now you tell them what you told me.  ,8,8
MULDER:    Scully?  I must have dozed off.  I was waiting for you to get back.  ,8,8
"MULDER:    It didn't take, did it?  ",8,8
MULDER:    Never give up on a miracle.  ,8,8
"MULDER:    You told your sister you were going to disappear, Mrs. Hangemuhl. Tonight.  ",8,11
MULDER:    I'm talking to your wife.  ,8,11
MULDER:    Mrs. Hangemuhl.  ,8,11
"MULDER:    You told your sister a story, a story you were afraid of?  ",8,11
"MULDER:    I don't think you were going anywhere tonight, Mrs. Hangemuhl.  I think someone or something was coming here.  And I think maybe it still is.  ",8,11
MULDER:    Who are you?  ,8,15
MULDER:    Only what I see in your face.  ,8,15
MULDER:    Anybody miss me?  ,8,15
MULDER: Nothing you'd be too terribly interested in Agent Doggett.  ,8,16
MULDER: Looking into the recent death of an oil worker.  ,8,16
MULDER: That's what I'm doing here.  ,8,16
"MULDER: Well maybe you missed the fact that this victim's corpse washes ashore in Port Arransis, Texas with massive flash burns on 90% of his body.  ",8,16
"MULDER: Then you must also know that this man was not the only man to disappear from the Galpex-Orpheus platform that night, but one of two men. The communications officer is also missing.  ",8,16
MULDER: Burns the M.E. said in his report we not inconsistent to exposure to high levels of radiation.  ,8,16
MULDER: These files include the same kind of radiation phenomenon. Tissue destroyed by exposure to ...  ,8,16
"MULDER: (Smiling) And you'd love to help, but you left your light-sabre at home.  ",8,16
"MULDER: How'd you get stuck down here, Agent Doggett? Kersh catch you peeing in his cornflakes?  ",8,16
MULDER: Just like old times.  ,8,16
MULDER: Tough crowd.  ,8,16
"MULDER: I believe we did speak, yeah.  ",8,16
"MULDER: That would have been me as well, Sir, and that was in the best interest of the FBI and Mr. Ortega. I believe.  ",8,16
MULDER: This incident has nothing to do with that whatsoever. It's about the unexplained death of Simon de la Cruz.  ,8,16
MULDER: A criminal investigation isn't doing to clear up anything.  ,8,16
MULDER: I don't think you know exactly what you're dealing with here Sir.  ,8,16
MULDER:(Firmly) This is an X-File.  ,8,16
MULDER: You're talking about an oil rig that's 150 miles out at sea. You cant send a pregnant woman.  ,8,16
"MULDER: If you give me a minute, I'm just getting in with details of the investigation. Why don't you pull up a chair and introduce yourself so Mr. Taylor won't have to repeat himself.  ",8,16
"MULDER: Communications chief, wasn't he?  ",8,16
"MULDER: I guess that's it, in a nutshell. Thank you Mr. Taylor.  ",8,16
MULDER: How are you going to call when the radio's broken?  ,8,16
MULDER: You won't do it.  ,8,16
"MULDER: We're both in the same boat, Agent Doggett. We're just paddling in different directions.  ",8,16
"MULDER: I don't think Kersh expects you to come back empty handed on this one. Since you have already told me about what you think about this case in so many words, I don't see you coming back with anything that's gonna protect anybody's business interests let alone your own ass.  ",8,16
"MULDER: I think he knows that truth about what happened, and he may not be the only one.  ",8,16
"MULDER: Really, what stories are those?  ",8,16
MULDER:(Deadpan Duchovny) What church?  ,8,16
"MULDER: I got it (MULDER sits down in front of the microphone. YURI leaves.) Well I'm sorry, Agent Doggett's gone fishing. Can I take a message please?  ",8,16
MULDER: I was just in the neighbourhood.  ,8,16
MULDER: Kersh doesn't need to know.  ,8,16
"MULDER: You need me out here Scully, you know that better than anyone.  ",8,16
"MULDER: Who's flouting orders, you found something didn't you, in that victim's body. The virus?  ",8,16
MULDER: Dead? What killed it?  ,8,16
MULDER: That's not possible.  ,8,16
MULDER: We got to quarantine this rig.  ,8,16
"MULDER: Scully, if these men are infected the last place we want to is onshore where they can infect other people. You're sitting on the answer right there, Scully. The body, you find the virus, you can find what knocks it out, you can find what kills it.  ",8,16
"MULDER: (Joking) When he's old enough, tell the kid I went down swinging!  ",8,16
MULDER: Agent Doggett's not here right now.  ,8,16
MULDER: That was Agent Scully.  ,8,16
MULDER: She said it was lucky that I'm out here.  ,8,16
"MULDER: Alright, then go ahead and take charge, Only you might not like what it means in this case. What you're going to have to do with that information you're so anxious to have.  ",8,16
"MULDER: I've been going over the crew manifest Mr. Sachs, and there appears to be a problem.  ",8,16
MULDER: According to the manifest there's supposed to be eighteen men onboard. I count only seventeen including you.  ,8,16
"MULDER: (To SACHS) Diego Garza, where's he?  ",8,16
MULDER: Any idea where he might be?  ,8,16
MULDER: (To DOGGETT) What do you say we go and find him?  ,8,16
MULDER: I'm hoping to find Diego Garza.  ,8,16
"MULDER: Did you see the crew manifest? It listed Diego Garza as mestizo, of mixed Mexican descent, just like his friend who died?  ",8,16
"MULDER: Well the crew chief said these mestizo were particularly good workers, but we've got one dead trying to sabotage the rig and another missing. If he's one of their best workers you'd think someone would've noticed him missing.  ",8,16
"MULDER: These men are hiding something, but that's not it.  ",8,16
MULDER: I don't know yet.  ,8,16
"MULDER: I didn't come out here just to bust your ass. I'm telling you, I've seen this substance. I've seen it can take over a man's body. This crew could be infected and not even know it. They may have no idea they're being controlled.  ",8,16
"MULDER: That's not how it works. It body jumps from man to man, and I'm not sure that it's in all oil.  ",8,16
MULDER: The man from Galpex oil lied ...  ,8,16
"MULDER: No, that new oil field is already in production. It's already being pumped by this rig. That's how this crew got infected.  ",8,16
"MULDER: Billions and billions of barrels lying right underneath us, waiting to be produced, waiting to infect that ninety percent of the planet you talked about.  ",8,16
"MULDER: Agent Doggett (DOGGETT turns back) what if that's why this man is hiding, this Diego Garza, because he knows what they're up to, and he knows what they're up to because he's the only one who's not infected with this alien virus.  ",8,16
MULDER: It's the radio room!  ,8,16
MULDER: What is it about this room that inspires men to violence?  ,8,16
MULDER: Molotov cocktail anyone?  ,8,16
"MULDER: Can I borrow your radio Mr. Sachs? (SACHS gives him the radio) Agent Doggett, you there?  ",8,16
"MULDER'S VOICE ON RADIO: Agent Doggett, do you copy?  ",8,16
MULDER: (On radio) Agent Doggett. Come in Agent Doggett.  ,8,16
"MULDER: Get up, Agent Doggett. (He points to TAYLOR lying unconscious/dead on the ground.) There's more where that came from.  ",8,16
"MULDER: You know anything about radio, Agent Doggett?  ",8,16
MULDER:  Let's see what little you know and get that ship-to-shore working.  ,8,16
MULDER: Anybody who can get us off here.  ,8,16
MULDER: Get to work!  ,8,16
MULDER: Agent Doggett!  ,8,16
MULDER: I don't think this door is going to hold much longer.  ,8,16
MULDER: Wagner?  ,8,16
MULDER: I take it back. It's perfect.  ,8,16
MULDER: That's someone knocking on the door.  ,8,16
MULDER: Tell her all the men here are infected. She's got to get the word to the choppers. Not to land on the platform.  ,8,16
"MULDER: Well, that problem is rapidly becoming moot!  ",8,16
MULDER: Destroying their ability to transmit just like Diego and Simon de la Cruz.  ,8,16
MULDER: I'm talking about contact.  ,8,16
"MULDER: Agent Doggett, listen.  ",8,16
"MULDER: No, no, no, listen.  ",8,16
"MULDER: I don't know, and I don't want to stick around to find out.  ",8,16
"MULDER: Let's go, Agent Doggett.  ",8,16
MULDER: Who?  ,8,16
MULDER: Agent Doggett!  ,8,16
MULDER: Is he coming?  ,8,16
"MULDER: Agent Doggett, I think I know why they let us go.  ",8,16
MULDER: They're going to blow the rig.  ,8,16
MULDER: I think he wants us to jump.  ,8,16
MULDER: How about a 20 count?  ,8,16
"MULDER: Where's the fire, Agent Doggett?  ",8,16
MULDER: You mean Galpex Oil?  ,8,16
MULDER: That oil should stay right where it is. You should do everything in your power to make sure that it does.  ,8,16
"MULDER: That is the Deputy Director calling to tell you there is no need to see you. That the blame has been properly assigned for what happened out on that platform. I'm out. 86'd, Agent Doggett.  ",8,16
MULDER: Kersh could barely contain his happiness. He stuck it to me.  ,8,16
MULDER: For you. For the X-Files. You're all the credibility this office has left. You have Kersh's ear and you have seen it now. Out on that platform. You saw it for yourself.  ,8,16
"MULDER: Answer the phone, Agent Doggett. You're in charge here now.  ",8,16
MULDER:    What?  ,8,17
MULDER:    You got something going on with the pizza man I should know about?  ,8,17
"MULDER:    Well, correct me if I'm wrong but you just said you were waiting for the pizza man to jump in the shower.  ",8,17
MULDER:    Thank you.  ,8,17
"MULDER:    Well, uh, yeah, but small technicality.   Mad About You was about a married couple and we just work together.  ",8,17
"MULDER:    I do, I do.  What-what I'm trying to say is that, uh... we have no good reliable information on this man.  I mean, what I am saying is the pizza man...  ",8,17
MULDER:     is not above suspicion.  ,8,17
MULDER:    Yeah.  ,8,17
MULDER:    (modestly embarrassed)   Thank you.  ,8,17
"MULDER:    Oh, uh, I was going through some stuff after my mother died and, um, it's just an old family keepsake and I wanted you to have it.  ",8,17
"MULDER:    Little Caesar, I presume?  ",8,17
"MULDER:    $29.08?  What'd she get on it, a tank of gas?  ",8,17
MULDER:    Scully?  ,8,17
MULDER:    Scully!  ,8,17
MULDER:    Call 911.  ,8,17
MULDER:    Her doctor is Dr. Speake.  ,8,17
MULDER:    She.  ,8,17
MULDER:    No.  ,8,17
MULDER:    How'd you find out?  ,8,17
MULDER:    Excuse me.  ,8,17
MULDER:   (on phone)    Mulder.  ,8,17
MULDER:   (on phone)    Speaking.  ,8,17
"MULDER:   (on phone, impatiently)    Who?  ",8,17
"MULDER:   (on phone)    I can't help you, Agent Reyes, for so many reasons.  I think you should contact Agent Doggett at the X-Files.  ",8,17
MULDER:   (on phone)    Call me when you get here.  ,8,17
MULDER:    Agent Reyes?  ,8,17
MULDER:    You keep on alluding to a time that we've met and I don't remember.  ,8,17
"MULDER:    Yeah.  Um, I-I have somewhere I have to be  if we could cut to the chase.  ",8,17
"MULDER:    No, I'm not at all familiar with Agent Doggett.  ",8,17
"MULDER scans the information.  He looks at another picture, crime scene photo of LUKE DOGGETT lying dead, face down on the ground.  There is sympathy in MULDER's voice.)  ",8,17
MULDER:    I-I wasn't aware of this.  You were the lead investigator?  ,8,17
MULDER:    You said this case involves some kind of phenomenon?  ,8,17
MULDER:    Changed?  Into what?  ,8,17
MULDER:    What do you think it means?  ,8,17
MULDER:    Hey!  Hey!  ,8,17
MULDER:    Take it easy!  ,8,17
"MULDER:    Take it easy, Agent Doggett.  ",8,17
MULDER:    I don't want anything on you.  I was asked to look into this file.  ,8,17
"MULDER:    Why don't you just calm down, Agent Doggett and let her explain the connection to you.  ",8,17
MULDER:    Bob Harvey.  Does that name mean something or nothing to you?  ,8,17
MULDER:    That's it.  ,8,17
MULDER:    Good.  ,8,17
"MULDER:    Well, that'd make sense.  It's not my office anymore but old habits die hard.  ",8,17
MULDER:    Cases involving images like you described.  People close to crimes who experience visions of death disassociated from reality.  ,8,17
MULDER:    Absolutely nothing.  These visions are so random as to have absolutely no significance to the cases they're supposed to pertain to.  ,8,17
MULDER:    I think I know these files.  ,8,17
MULDER:    I think that's a coincidence.  I think that life is full of them.  ,8,17
MULDER:    I think there's an opening coming up in this office soon.  You might want to apply.  ,8,17
"MULDER:    I have a, uh, sick friend in the hospital and, uh, I think I should go see her.  ",8,17
"MULDER:    You'll say anything, won't you?  ",8,17
"MULDER:    Been asking myself that same question, Agent Doggett.  But it seems the tenacious Agent Reyes does not want to let go of this one.  ",8,17
"MULDER:    She's got a murder victim out here, a woman found shot.  She thinks it's probably the same man who killed those two people down in New Orleans-- this Jeb Dukes.  ",8,17
"MULDER:    She wants to know if you see it, too.  What she's been seeing.  ",8,17
"MULDER:    Whoo.  You just keep shooting till you hit something, don't you?  ",8,17
MULDER:    (dryly)   I saw Elvis in a potato chip once.  ,8,17
"MULDER:    Yes, I do.  I do.  But if this man doesn't see it, he doesn't see it, right?  ",8,17
MULDER:    You awake?  ,8,17
MULDER:    What did the doctor say?  ,8,17
MULDER:    But you're going to be fine?  ,8,17
"MULDER:    I've actually been out in the field with Agent Doggett and this, um, female Agent from New Orleans.  ",8,17
MULDER:    Yeah.  ,8,17
MULDER:    You're nothing at all alike.  ,8,17
"MULDER:    Yeah.  Actually, one that involves Agent Doggett's son, the son who died.  ",8,17
MULDER:    You can't help a man who can't help himself.  ,8,17
MULDER:    Agent Doggett...  ,8,17
MULDER:    She just fell back to sleep.  ,8,17
"MULDER:    And now you're wondering if there really was a connection.  You know, when I, uh... I first came to work at the FBI, I worked at Violent Crimes, and I saw, I saw the worst of humanity.  I saw monsters and I wondered how they became that way, how these men became so evil. I know there were psychological explanations-- victims of their environment, victims of their parents-- but the scientific explanations were never truly satisfying.  And I began to think about evil like, like a disease.  You know, that it goes from man to man or age to age.  Most of us walk around thinking we're incapable of any acts of evil and we are.  You know, we can stifle that momentary urge to kill or to hurt.  We have some kind of immunity to it.  But I think it's possible that there's... an occurrence in somebody's life, a tragedy or a loss that leaves them vulnerable, hurts their immunity to evil, and all of a sudden at that point in their lives when they're weakened, they're open to evil and they can become evil.  ",8,17
"MULDER:    Uh, I'm not really a good test for questions like that.  I'll believe almost anything, you know, but the, uh... the pisser is you may never know.  It may be like Agent Reyes says.  It could be random and meaningless-- who it affects, who it goes to.  ",8,17
"MULDER:    Well, then you'd be seeing something that I don't, Agent Doggett.  ",8,17
MULDER:    That's cool.  We can just wait for the cheese to congeal and eat it later.  ,8,17
"MULDER:    You miss your regular pizza man, don't you?  ",8,17
"MULDER:    I bet you forgot about that, didn't you?  ",8,17
MULDER:    And?  ,8,17
MULDER:    Is it what you imagined?  ,8,17
"MULDER:    Oh, my, that's the wrong doll, actually.  ",8,17
"MULDER:    Yeah.  For a guy who was, uh... in a coffin not too long ago I think I'm doing pretty damn good.  I don't quite have my legs under me... yet.  ",8,18
MULDER:    Uh-oh.  ,8,18
MULDER:    (not sounding thrilled)   Wow.  ,8,18
MULDER:    Like Austin Powers.  ,8,18
MULDER:    Mmm.  ,8,18
MULDER:    Something looks different.  ,8,18
MULDER:    Ah... that's it.  ,8,18
MULDER:    Missing a molly.  ,8,18
"MULDER:    Well, you act like you're surprised.  ",8,18
MULDER:    In more ways than one.  ,8,18
MULDER:    I'm happy for you.  I think I know... how much that means to you.  ,8,18
"MULDER:    I'm sorry.  I don't mean to be cold or ungrateful.  I just... I have no idea where I fit in.  Right now.  I just, uh...  I'm having a little trouble... processing... everything.  ",8,18
MULDER:    Kersh wants to put me behind a desk?  That is not what Kersh wants.  ,8,18
"MULDER:    And you by putting you in this position.  And Agent Scully, for not giving up on me.  Truth is, this is a bullet that was fired about eight years ago.  It's a magic bullet that's been going round and round and right now it seems poised to hit me right in the back of the head.  ",8,18
"MULDER:    Scully, you're going to give birth in a couple months.  You can talk as tough as you like but you know and I know and they know that in a little while you're going to have more important things than whether or not the X-Files remains open.  ",8,18
MULDER:    Agent who?  ,8,18
"MULDER:    Mission accomplished.  Does he know what he's doing at all, this guy?  ",8,18
"MULDER:    I see.  Then maybe the question is not who fired this magic bullet, but whether or not it was a lone gunman.  ",8,18
"MULDER:    Well, good.  At least he's manoeuvrable.  ",8,18
MULDER:    I'm going to get dressed.  For the first time I feel like getting back to work.  ,8,18
MULDER:    Hey.  ,8,18
MULDER:    Who says you can't go home again?  ,8,18
MULDER:    What's it look like?  ,8,18
"MULDER:    Hey, I am just down here visiting my buds. Where is this Agent Doggett anyway?  What kind of hours does he keep?  ",8,18
MULDER:    Why?  ,8,18
MULDER:    Anything to do with this?  This Absalom abductee class picture?  ,8,18
"MULDER:    Because I noticed that the man who was shot on the White House lawn is one of the men in that photograph.  Top right hand corner.  In profile. Howard Salt, if I'm not mistaken.  ",8,18
MULDER:    Consider that a freebie.  The next one's going to cost you.  ,8,18
"MULDER:    Oh, I don't know anything.  But you know me, I got a real big hunch.  This Howard Salt was a multiple alien abductee, worked for the U.S. Census Bureau.  Wanted to get word to the President, unspecified grievances.  What do you want to bet those grievances were?  ",8,18
MULDER:    I think they killed him for it.  ,8,18
"MULDER:    Once again, I'm a betting man.  I'm betting he had more than that.  ",8,18
MULDER:    Ooh.  There's that word again.  ,8,18
"MULDER:    Do you want to hear something really paranoid?  The FBI gets its way, there's going to be nobody down here to ask the paranoid questions. Nobody to find those faces in those photographs.  Surely not this Agent Doggett.  ",8,18
MULDER:    Really?  When I was dead I was hoping maybe they changed the rules.  ,8,18
MULDER:    Then why don't you shut the door so he doesn't find out.  ,8,18
"MULDER:    Neither do I, really.  But maybe it's like Howard Salt's picture.  I'll know it when I see it.  ",8,18
"MULDER:    You don't get it, do you, Scully?  The man shot at the White House, the prison escapee, there's something bubbling to the surface here.  I want to know what it is.  ",8,18
MULDER:    Since when has an X-File not defied a certain standard of credibility?  At least that's the way it used to work.  ,8,18
"MULDER:    Look, Scully, I need to make sense of what happened to me.  So that I can stop it.  Because if I can't stop it, it could happen to anyone.  It could happen to you.  And who's to say it's going to stop there?  ",8,18
"MULDER:    Yeah, well, compared to where I just was, prison would be a Princess cruise.  ",8,18
MULDER:    Ho.  Hey.  What the hell is this?  ,8,18
MULDER:    The entire hard drive is taken up with this.  Ten gigabytes of memory.  ,8,18
MULDER:    Mm.  ,8,18
MULDER:    I'm going to book myself on that Princess cruise.  ,8,18
MULDER:    Sir.  ,8,18
MULDER:    Is this John Doggett?  You Agent Doggett?  ,8,18
MULDER:    I hope you're not commending him as a hero for what he did   ,8,18
"MULDER:     in this thing, 'cause he's not.  ",8,18
MULDER:    The problem? You occupy an office that used to be devoted to finding the truth and now you're busy burying it.  That's the problem.  ,8,18
MULDER:    You got that man killed.  ,8,18
MULDER:    Because of what he knew.  What he was going to expose.  ,8,18
"MULDER:    I see you sitting there, Agent Doggett.  That's good enough for me.  ",8,18
MULDER:    Melvin.  I'd be a whole lot happier to see you if you'd just take your hands off my ass.  ,8,18
MULDER:    Downloaded from where?  ,8,18
"MULDER:    All right, what are you waiting for, boys?  Get cracking.  ",8,18
"MULDER:    Well, why do that?  ",8,18
MULDER:    Because I'm right.  Because they would kill to protect what's in those files.  ,8,18
MULDER:    Oh.  I see.  ,8,18
MULDER:    Somebody's been doing a little campaigning for her cause.  ,8,18
"MULDER:    Well, just remember, boys, this is America.  Just because you get more votes doesn't mean you win.  ",8,18
"MULDER:    Scully, what are you doing back?  Did something just happen?  ",8,18
"MULDER:    Scully, if you know something that can get us moving forward again, you need to tell me.  ",8,18
MULDER:    (on radio)   Frohike?  Langly? Byers?  Let's go.  I'm dying out here.  ,8,18
MULDER:    (on radio)   Is the system bypassed?  ,8,18
MULDER:    (on radio)   Great.  ,8,18
"MULDER:    (on radio)   Come on, guys.  I'm on autopilot here.  ",8,18
"MULDER:    (on radio)   Hey, who's working on the locks, fellas?  ",8,18
MULDER:   Let's do some e-mailing.  ,8,18
MULDER:    (on radio)   Just a fly buzzing around the window.  ,8,18
"MULDER:    I think you're trying to keep this information from ever seeing the light of day, just like you did once before, Agent Doggett.  That's what I think.  ",8,18
"MULDER:    Well, you're about to, along with a lot of other people.  There going to learn that they've been targeted because of their genetic profiles for abduction and replacement by alien facsimiles.  What do you say we start off with the Washington Post, huh?  ",8,18
"MULDER:    What are you going to do, shoot me?  ",8,18
MULDER:   (on radio)   Why?  ,8,18
MULDER:    You son of a bitch. You set me up.  ,8,18
"MULDER:    Hey, get off of me.  ",8,18
"MULDER:    (on radio, sounding depressed, glaring at DOGGETT)   Yeah, I'm here.  ",8,18
MULDER:    (on radio)   Except what?!  ,8,18
MULDER: Hey. Ready to roll?  ,8,19
"MULDER: Hey, don't forget this. (He picks up a cushion and stuffs it under his shirt). Relax the back, breathe in, breathe out (makes panting noises).  ",8,19
MULDER: I'm unemployed. I have a lot of time on my hands. Oprah. I watch a lot of Oprah.  ,8,19
MULDER: What's the matter?  ,8,19
MULDER: This having-a-baby this?  ,8,19
"MULDER: You paid your dues there, Scully. More than paid them. You're concerned about Agent Doggett?  ",8,19
MULDER: I'm betting that Agent Doggett can take care of himself. He's a big boy. You gotta worry about the little boy. (Smiling) Or little girl. Boy? Or girl?  ,8,19
"MULDER: It seems like old times. You in scrubs, slicing and dicing.  ",8,19
"MULDER: Actually, I, I wandered away from my tour. (He indicates his visitors badge.) Better question is what are you doing here?  ",8,19
MULDER: Venom. Produced by reptiles.  ,8,19
MULDER: Before Agent Doggett and his partner went missing they sent in samples to be analysed. Hydrolytic enzymes. Skinner told me.  ,8,19
MULDER: Let somebody else do it. (Making a point) There are other concerns right now.  ,8,19
MULDER: I know where he could find somebody ...  ,8,19
MULDER: I'm not out here. (Looking around) What happened to the search?  ,8,19
MULDER: How did it get there?  ,8,19
MULDER: I think I'll take a walk in the woods.  ,8,19
"MULDER: Now, what the hell, I'm out of a job already, right?  ",8,19
MULDER: You are?  ,8,19
"MULDER: You're just the man I want to speak to, Mr. Stites. Have you seen anything unusual around here?  ",8,19
"MULDER: Dangerous animals, reptiles.  ",8,19
MULDER: That is what they are looking for.  ,8,19
"MULDER: I don't think Gary Sacks committed the crime, Mr. Stites. I think he is a victim himself.  ",8,19
MULDER: Kersh. Alvin Kersh.  ,8,19
MULDER: What kind of scientist are you?  ,8,19
MULDER: I don't think this was an animal. I think it was a man using some kind of reptile venom to blind them first.  ,8,19
"MULDER: Well, you would really have to know what you were doing. You would have to be, say, a scientist.  ",8,19
"MULDER: No. I'm just thinking out loud, Mr. Stites.  ",8,19
MULDER: Mulder.  ,8,19
"MULDER: I'm spitting sunflower shells on Herman Stites' driveway. What are you doing, Scully?  ",8,19
"MULDER: Well, what's he mad about? Me impersonating Kersh or me harassing Stites?  ",8,19
"MULDER: What are you saying it is, Scully?  ",8,19
"MULDER: I don't think it is a monster we are dealing with here, I think it is a man.  ",8,19
MULDER: You re-gifted.  ,8,19
MULDER: My Apollo medallion.  ,8,19
MULDER: Yeah. I found it on the grass on Stites' estate. Doggett must be around here somewhere.  ,8,19
MULDER: Mulder.  ,8,19
MULDER: What did you find.  ,8,19
"MULDER: You don't think he succeeded, do you?  ",8,19
MULDER: I think Mr. Stites may have a lot more than that to explain.  ,8,19
"MULDER: Mr. Stites! Mr. Stites, open up!  ",8,19
MULDER: Mr. Stites! Open the door!  ,8,19
MULDER: Mr. Stites!  ,8,19
MULDER: Mr. Stites!  ,8,19
"MULDER: Where is it, Mr. Stites? This thing you're protecting, this creature of yours. I don't think you meant for it to, but it got out last night and attacked the caretaker and his son and then it attacked my colleague. (STITES doesn't respond.) Now, I can have 50 men in here to comb this place within the hour. (STITES still doesn't respond.) Where are they, Mr. Stites?  ",8,19
MULDER: Agent Doggett!  ,8,19
"MULDER: It's alright, Agent Doggett. We're gonna get you out of here.  ",8,19
MULDER: It's the man who lives here.  ,8,19
"MULDER: Agent Doggett, I know ...  ",8,19
MULDER: Agent Doggett. I don't have a weapon. I'm coming to get yours.  ,8,19
"MULDER: Or, I'm not.  ",8,19
MULDER: It's right above you. It's coming this way.  ,8,19
MULDER: Get down. Aim at the sound of my voice.  ,8,19
MULDER: You're not going to shoot me.  ,8,19
MULDER: Aim at the sound of my voice.  ,8,19
MULDER: Aim at me!  ,8,19
MULDER: I'll tell you when to fire. Fire!  ,8,19
"MULDER:  Right here. Right here, Agent Doggett.  (DOGGETT is relieved.)  ",8,19
MULDER: We just came by to visit Agent Harrison.  ,8,19
MULDER: I want to return something to you that I think you deserve to keep.  ,8,19
MULDER: Sure.  ,8,19
MULDER: It wasn't?  ,8,19
MULDER: Something?  ,8,19
MULDER: Well what do you think that was?  ,8,19
MULDER: I can't believe that you're saying it's not a spaceship.  ,8,19
MULDER: Course it was a spaceship.  ,8,19
MULDER: You know it was a spaceship. You saw it.  ,8,19
"MULDER: Now, come on, Scully. It was a spaceship.  ",8,19
MULDER:   (voiceover)   We call it the miracle of life.  Conception:  A union of perfect opposites-- essence transforming into existence-- an act without which mankind would not exist and humanity cease to exist.  ,8,20
"MULDER:   (voiceover)   Or is this just nostalgia now?  An act of biology commandeered by modern science and technology?  Godlike, we extract, implant, inseminate... and we clone.  ",8,20
"MULDER:   (voiceover)   But has our ingenuity rendered the miracle into a simple trick? In the artifice of replicating life can we become the creator?  Then what of the soul?  Can it, too, be replicated?  Does it live in this matter we call DNA?  Or is its placement the opposite of artifice, capable only by God.  ",8,20
MULDER:    (voiceover)   How did this child come to be?  What set its heart beating?  Is it the product of a union?  Or the work of a divine hand?  An answered prayer?  A true miracle?  Or is it a wonder of technology-- the intervention of other hands?  What do I tell this child about to be born?  What do I tell Scully?  ,8,20
MULDER:    (voiceover)    And what do I tell myself?  ,8,20
MULDER:    Never give up on a miracle.  ,8,20
"MULDER:    You can drop the ""Agent,"" Agent Doggett.  It's just plain old Fox Mulder now.  ",8,20
MULDER:    That's what I was doing.  Slightly different race though.  ,8,20
MULDER:    Zeus Genetics.  That ring a bell?  ,8,20
MULDER:    Looks like somebody's attempt to make sure it never will be.  ,8,20
MULDER:    I think that's the idea-- to cover up the kind of research that was going on there.  That's why I came to talk to you.  ,8,20
MULDER:    How about a ride?  ,8,20
MULDER:    Agent Doggett?  ,8,20
"MULDER:    Hey, I hope you don't mind me dropping your name with the local PD. They just told me that they contacted everyone at Zeus Genetics except for one man-- a Dr. Lev--  a founder, and head of clinical research.  ",8,20
MULDER:    That would probably stand to reason.  ,8,20
"MULDER:    Pissing people off comes with the territory, Agent Doggett.  It's part of working on the X-Files.  ",8,20
"MULDER:    Hey, I told you Dr. Lev was a founder of the clinic.  Would you like to know who his cofounder was?  Dr. Parenti.  Agent Scully's obstetrician through the first two-thirds of her pregnancy.  ",8,20
"MULDER:    I don't know, but if I'm the Agent assigned to the X-Files, I sure as hell would want to ask him.  (pause)  Worst it could do is piss him off.  ",8,20
"MULDER:    Knock, knock.  ",8,20
"MULDER:    I'll just say I'm with you, Agent Doggett.  It's Saturday anyway, right? We're just having a look around.  ",8,20
MULDER:    Me?  ,8,20
"MULDER:    I'm with an FBI agent who would like to ask you the exact same question. Dr. Parenti, isn't it?  ",8,20
MULDER:    What is this?  Some kind of showroom?  ,8,20
MULDER:    Does that work include experimentation with alien embryos?  Work that you would destroy to cover up such allegations?  ,8,20
MULDER:    From a friend of mine-- a former patient of yours-- Dana Scully.  ,8,20
MULDER:    Is she?  ,8,20
"MULDER:    You found something, didn't you?  ",8,20
MULDER:    Anything else?  ,8,20
MULDER:    Let's ask Dr. Parenti  if it's okay with Agent Crane.  ,8,20
MULDER:    The man loves his work.  ,8,20
MULDER:    Agent Doggett.  Look at this.  ,8,20
MULDER:    Ahh! Scully.  ,8,20
"MULDER:    (smiling up at her)   I see why you gave up a career in medicine for the FBI, Scully.  You've got manos de piedra.  ",8,20
MULDER:    Imagine if he'd really connected.  ,8,20
MULDER:    Billy Miles.  ,8,20
MULDER:    Ask Agent Doggett.  He saw him.  ,8,20
"MULDER:    Ask me, the kid isn't a kid.  ",8,20
MULDER:    He is a type of alien.  A human replacement.  One who looks human.  Look at his strength.  The way he took those slugs.  ,8,20
"MULDER:    Well, then, you're ignoring who Billy Miles is.  You, of all people, Agent Doggett who's supposedly running the X-Files.  ",8,20
"MULDER:    Well, Billy Miles is a whole new deal.  He's an alien abductee who was returned after hideous procedures were performed on him.  And who miraculously returns to so-called perfect health when his body completely sheds its skin.  ",8,20
MULDER:    Same thing would've happened to me if I'd been left alone.  ,8,20
MULDER:    If Scully hadn't treated me.  ,8,20
MULDER:    Same as when he torched Zeus Genetics and destroyed their experiments with alien biology and the doctors performing them.  ,8,20
MULDER:    Looking for answers.  ,8,20
MULDER:    One of those doctors was your doctor.  ,8,20
"MULDER:    Listen, Scully, I'm sorry, but I just need to know that this baby of yours is going to be all right.  ",8,20
MULDER:    That's... that's all I'm trying to do.  Just make sure nothing happens to you; that this baby you're carrying is born without any surprises.  ,8,20
MULDER:    And what point would that be? [Closed Captioning:  You fellas are starting the party without me?]  ,8,20
MULDER:    What?  ,8,20
MULDER:    You said there'd been a murder.  ,8,20
"MULDER:    (smiles)   Ahh...  Yeah, I hear there's a pool running down at the FBI, placing bets.  ",8,20
"MULDER:    You want to know who the father is, that's Scully's business. But if you're asking me how a woman who was diagnosed as barren and unable to conceive is about to give birth in a couple days, that's an answer I can't honestly give.  ",8,20
"MULDER:    Sir, just...    Let me.  ",8,20
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Hey, Scully, it's me.  Are you all right?  ",8,20
MULDER:   (on phone)    I need to see you.  I've got Skinner with me.  It's not something that can really wait.  ,8,20
MULDER:   (on phone)    It's about your pregnancy.  Skinner's got some questions based on some new information.  ,8,20
MULDER:   (on phone)    Evidence of interference by someone.  ,8,20
"MULDER:    She's fine, according to her doctor.  Apparently, it was a false alarm. Whatever this woman was up to...  ",8,20
MULDER:    Money from who?  ,8,20
MULDER:    But the work continued.  ,8,20
MULDER:    What other experiments?  ,8,20
MULDER:    What did you do to Scully?  ,8,20
MULDER:    (leaning forward)   What did you do to her?!  ,8,20
MULDER:    (yelling)    Tell me what's wrong with her!  Tell me what's wrong with her baby!  ,8,20
MULDER:    (from the hall)   It's me.  ,8,20
MULDER:    You here alone?  ,8,20
"MULDER:    Whatever you can't get elsewhere, just throw it together.  ",8,20
"MULDER:    No, your, your baby is fine.  It's you who's in danger now, Scully.  ",8,20
"MULDER:    I don't know, I'm not sure.  I'm not sure about anything.  I just know I got to get you out of here.  ",8,20
"MULDER:    This isn't about the X-Files, Scully.  It is only about you.  Now, you are going to have this baby and I'm going to do everything I can to protect it.  I just can't do that here.  ",8,20
MULDER:   (on phone)    Mulder.  ,8,20
MULDER:   (on phone)    Agent Doggett...  ,8,20
MULDER:    Leave the suitcase.  ,8,20
"MULDER:    Get in, go around.  ",8,20
"MULDER:    I don't think that matters much, Scully.  ",8,20
MULDER:    Tell us about Billy Miles.  ,8,20
MULDER:    What about Scully?  What do they want with her?  ,8,20
MULDER:    Are you saying that they're afraid of it?  ,8,20
MULDER:    That there's a God... a higher power.  ,8,20
MULDER:    Agent Doggett.  Get on the phone.  If we're going to get Scully out of here we're going to need some help.  ,8,20
MULDER:    You're going to protect her.  ,8,20
MULDER:    Tell us about Billy Miles.  ,8,21
"MULDER:    It's you who's in danger now, Scully.  ",8,21
"MULDER:    If we're going to get SCULLY out of here, we're going to need some help.  ",8,21
MULDER:    This is a video grab from the DC morgue.  It's Billy Miles.  ,8,21
"MULDER:    Yeah. It can't be, but it is.  Walking out of the morgue looking like a new man.  ",8,21
MULDER:    Which Scully is a threat to.  ,8,21
"MULDER:    You heard about this, right?  ",8,21
MULDER:    He's got a concussion.  They're going to keep him here for observation. Where were you when this all happened?  ,8,21
MULDER:    Who?  ,8,21
MULDER:    Skinner could've been killed.  He's lucky he wasn't.  ,8,21
MULDER:    What exactly did he tell you?  ,8,21
MULDER:    I want to know who the hell you've been talking to  ,8,21
MULDER:    .--- who this trusted source of yours is who's been spinning this fantasy.  ,8,21
"MULDER:    Did he ever lie to you?  Give you bad information, false leads?  ",8,21
"MULDER:    (incredulously)   Well, you have to think about it?  ",8,21
"MULDER:    You didn't tell him where she is, did you?  ",8,21
"MULDER:    (emphatically)   You don't tell anybody where she is.  That's the deal, right? Not even me.  ",8,21
"MULDER:    This, uh, trusted source of yours told you he knows how to stop Billy Miles. Did he happen to tell you how he plans to do this?  ",8,21
"MULDER:    Right. Well, what do you say you and me go find out how trustworthy he really is?  ",8,21
"MULDER:    Hey. You know, how is it that this friend of yours is so desperate for your help?  And then when we want to reach him, all of a sudden he's unreachable, nowhere to be found?  ",8,21
MULDER:    You told me that he told you he knew how to stop Billy Miles.  Are you telling me now that you think he's a liar?  ,8,21
MULDER:    It doesn't make any difference at all.  Unless you want to protect Scully and that baby.  ,8,21
MULDER:   (softly)    I don't know.  Maybe it doesn't.  ,8,21
MULDER:    Start the car.  ,8,21
MULDER:    Alex Krycek just pulled in.  ,8,21
MULDER:    You recognize his passenger?  ,8,21
"MULDER:    Not to see you, that's for sure.  ",8,21
MULDER:    You go ahead.  I got Krycek.  ,8,21
MULDER:   (on phone)    Yeah?  ,8,21
MULDER:   (on phone)    Agent Crane?  How the hell does he know Agent Crane?  ,8,21
"MULDER:   (on phone)    You been wondering who's getting these guys past security, how Billy Miles is in the FBI?  Agent Crane is in on this with your friend, which means he's in on it with Krycek.  They've been in on it all along.  ",8,21
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Fooling us, Agent Doggett.  Into chasing after Billy Miles. Into believing that we could protect her.  ",8,21
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Yes, they know where she is.  ",8,21
"MULDER:   (on phone)    You and Agent Reyes.  You called her from a phone inside the FBI, didn't you?  ",8,21
"MULDER:   (on phone)    Maybe this goes even higher.  Listen to me,  I've got to get to Scully.  You've got to tell me where she is, where you sent her.  ",8,21
"MULDER:   (on phone)    No, you listen. You've got to get out of there.  You've got no guarantee these guys aren't alien replacements, too.  ",8,21
"MULDER:    What do you know about fair or right, Krycek?  You're a coward.  ",8,21
MULDER:    Then there really is no God.  ,8,21
MULDER:    I wanted to stop them.  All you wanted was to save your own ass.  ,8,21
"MULDER:    You want to kill me, Alex, kill me.  Like you killed my father.  Just don't insult me trying to make me understand.  ",8,21
MULDER:    I'm going to go to the airport.  I need that location from Agent Doggett.  ,8,21
"MULDER:    Skinner, are you with me?  ",8,21
MULDER:    Down there.  Get me down there.  ,8,21
MULDER:    Hey!  Scully!  Scully!  Where is she?!  Scully!  Where is she?!  (yelling) Scully!  Where is she?  Tell me where she is!  ,8,21
MULDER:    How is she?  ,8,21
MULDER:    See it with your own eyes.  ,8,21
MULDER:    There was a light.  I followed it.  ,8,21
MULDER:    How's everybody doing?  ,8,21
"MULDER:    Hey, now.  ",8,21
MULDER:    (with tender authority)   None of that.  ,8,21
MULDER:    (breathlessly)   Hi.  ,8,21
MULDER:    What are you going to call him?  ,8,21
"MULDER:    Well, I don't know.  He's... he's got your coloring and your eyes.  But he looks suspiciously like Assistant Director Skinner.  ",8,21
"MULDER:    I don't quite understand that either.  Except that maybe he isn't what they thought he was.  That doesn't make him any less of a miracle though, does it?  ",8,21
MULDER:    I think what we feared were the possibilities.  The truth we both know.  ,8,21
MULDER: I think what we feared were the possibilities. The truth we both know.  ,9,1
MULDER: No! You're dead.  ,9,19
MULDER: Where am I?  ,9,19
MULDER: I'm thinking about getting the hell out of here.  ,9,19
MULDER: About my son ... about his mother.  ,9,19
MULDER: What do you want from me?!  ,9,19
MULDER: Yes.  ,9,19
MULDER: What should I be thinking?  ,9,19
MULDER: Yes.  ,9,19
MULDER: I'm a guilty man. I failed in every respect. I deserve the harshest punishment for my crime.  ,9,19
MULDER: Dana.  ,9,19
MULDER: You okay?  ,9,19
"MULDER: Well, it's okay, I'm all right. They're treating me really well in here.  ",9,19
MULDER: Nothing. I'm squared away.  ,9,19
"MULDER: Oh, hey, Walter. It's good to see you, man.  ",9,19
"MULDER: Oh, yeah, yeah. We're clear on that.  ",9,19
MULDER: My crimes.  ,9,19
"MULDER: (interrupting) I murdered a man, Dana. I went looking for something that didn't exist, and I ... I made a terrible mistake. I should be punished severely.  ",9,19
MULDER: I don't think you heard me.  ,9,19
MULDER: And why is that? I'm a guilty man.  ,9,19
MULDER: Uh ... excuse me.  ,9,19
MULDER: (whispering) I don't understand. Why are you helping me?  ,9,19
MULDER: You saw him? Mulder?  ,9,19
"MULDER: I smelled you coming, Clarice.  ",9,19
"MULDER: No, that is funny.  ",9,19
MULDER: What's not funny is what they do to you in here if you don't put on that act.  ,9,19
"MULDER: Come here, you big, bald, beautiful man.  ",9,19
"MULDER: Uh-huh, I kind of gathered that right around the 50th brainwashing session.  ",9,19
MULDER:  They think that they're preparing me for my trial. For my testimony.  ,9,19
MULDER: Not building. Rigging.  ,9,19
MULDER: My trial's a forgone conclusion. What they really want is for me to admit my guilt and help them out. What's really on trial here is the truth.  ,9,19
MULDER: Have they produced a body?  ,9,19
MULDER: You can't produce a body because you can't kill a man who won't die.  ,9,19
MULDER: Would you defend a man who believes in aliens against the FBI and the military? It's never going to happen. Skinner can defend me.  ,9,19
"MULDER: You know all the facts, the details the whole government conspiracy. (MULDER looks at SKINNER.) More than that, I trust you.  ",9,19
MULDER: They can't try me without exposing themselves. I know what I'm doing.  ,9,19
"MULDER: Whooo, now it's a party.  ",9,19
MULDER: Is it time to go?  ,9,19
"MULDER: We can't win, Scully. We can only hope to go down fighting.  ",9,19
MULDER: I know what I'm doing.  ,9,19
MULDER: I do know. Skinner told me.  ,9,19
MULDER: I know you had no choice. I just missed both of you so much.  ,9,19
MULDER: In New Mexico.  ,9,19
MULDER: Looking for The Truth.  ,9,19
MULDER: I can't tell you.  ,9,19
"MULDER: Scully, I can't tell you.  ",9,19
"MULDER: (sadly) You've got to trust me, Scully. I know things. It's better you don't.  ",9,19
MULDER: (to SKINNER) It's okay. Try your case.  ,9,19
MULDER: Yeah. The destruction of mankind.  ,9,19
MULDER: I know what you want and I can't give it to you.  ,9,19
"MULDER: I'd rather die, Scully.  ",9,19
MULDER: Because this is greater than you or me. This is about everything we worked for for nine years. The truth that we both sacrificed so much to uncover and to expose.  ,9,19
MULDER: I can't.  ,9,19
MULDER: I just can't.  ,9,19
MULDER: Who's that? Who's there?  ,9,19
MULDER: What are you doing here?  ,9,19
MULDER: I'm putting the truth on trial.  ,9,19
MULDER: They're afraid to hear it.  ,9,19
MULDER: I'm not afraid of that.  ,9,19
MULDER: No. Because I refuse to accept it.  ,9,19
MULDER: How can you possibly help me?  ,9,19
MULDER: No.  ,9,19
MULDER: It's okay. Let her go.  ,9,19
MULDER: Doesn't matter.  ,9,19
"MULDER: No, not him.  ",9,19
MULDER (to SKINNER): You don't understand. I'm trying to protect that boy.  ,9,19
MULDER: He's reading your mind right now.  ,9,19
MULDER: He's one of them.  ,9,19
MULDER: One of them! I want that man examined!  ,9,19
MULDER: You're afraid!  ,9,19
MULDER (yelling): You're afraid of what I know! You're afraid of the truth!  ,9,19
MULDER: Where's Gibson?  ,9,19
MULDER: He shouldn't have done what he did -- exposing himself like that.  ,9,19
MULDER: It's going to take a little more than that the way things are going. We were never going to win.  ,9,19
MULDER: No.  ,9,19
MULDER: No.  ,9,19
"MULDER: Listen to me, they'll destroy you. They'll put you out on the street.  ",9,19
MULDER: It's not about how good you are. They control the game. They own it.  ,9,19
MULDER: What?  ,9,19
"MULDER: If she's got evidence, you got to listen.  ",9,19
MULDER: (softly) Yes.  ,9,19
"MULDER: I'd like to congratulate you on succeeding where so many before you have failed. A bullet between the eyes would have been preferable to this charade. But I've learned to pretend over the past nine years - to pretend that my victories mattered only to realize that no one was keeping score. To realize that liars do not fear the truth if there are enough liars. That the devil is just one man with a plan but evil, true evil, is a collaboration of men which is what we have here today. If I am a guilty man, my crime is in daring to believe that the truth will out and that no one lie can live forever. I believe it still. Much as you try to bury it, the truth is out there. Greater than your lies, the truth wants to be known. You will know it. It'll come to you, as it's come to me faster than the speed of light.  ",9,19
MULDER: You may believe yourselves rid of your headache now and maybe you are .. but you're only done it by cutting off your own heads.  ,9,19
MULDER: Who's there?  ,9,19
MULDER: What are you doing?  ,9,19
MULDER: None of you will be safe now.  ,9,19
MULDER: That's right.  ,9,19
MULDER: To see a man about The Truth.  ,9,19
"MULDER: Oh, boy.  ",9,19
MULDER: I can't.  ,9,19
MULDER: Because I need to know the truth.  ,9,19
MULDER: I need to know if I can change it.  ,9,19
"MULDER: I'll be right with you, Scully.  ",9,19
"MULDER: Pueblos. Anasazi Indian. Abandoned 2,000 years ago. Nobody knows why.  ",9,19
MULDER: Hello. My name is Fox Mulder. Do you understand me?  ,9,19
MULDER: I was sent a message and a key to the government facility at Mount Weather. The Indians said it was from a wise man who lived in the ruins: A Keeper of the Truth.  ,9,19
MULDER: You're no wise man. You're a dead man. Just like Krycek and X.  ,9,19
MULDER: You didn't help me. You sent me to that government facility knowing exactly what I'd find.  ,9,19
MULDER: You call me afraid? Look at you sitting here alone in the dark like a fossil.  ,9,19
"MULDER: Come on, let's go.  ",9,19
MULDER: You don't have to hear this.  ,9,19
"MULDER: Yeah, you smile ... feeling drunk with power. The power to do nothing.  ",9,19
MULDER: Agent Doggett!  ,9,19
MULDER: Get out of here!  ,9,19
MULDER: No!  ,9,19
MULDER: (insistent) Go! Go!  ,9,19
MULDER: I'm thinking ... I'm a guilty man. I've failed in every respect. I deserve the harshest punishment for my crimes.  ,9,19
"MULDER: I believe that I sat in a motel room like this with you when we first met and I tried to convince you of the truth. And in that respect, I succeeded, but ... in every other way ...  ",9,19
MULDER: ... I've failed.  ,9,19
MULDER: Mmmm.  ,9,19
MULDER: I've been chasing after monsters with a butterfly net. You heard the man - the date's set. I can't change that.  ,9,19
"MULDER: Well, I was afraid of what knowing would do to you.  ",9,19
MULDER: I was afraid that it would crush your spirit.  ,9,19
MULDER: And look what it's gotten you.  ,9,19
"MULDER: I want to believe that the dead are not lost to us. That they speak to us as part of something greater than us - greater than any alien force. And if you and I are powerless now, I want to believe that if we listen to what's speaking, it can give us the power to save ourselves.  ",9,19
MULDER: (whispers) Maybe there's hope.  ,9,19
