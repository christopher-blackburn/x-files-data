SCULLY: Hi. I got your message.  ,1,1
SCULLY: It's two-o-clock in the afternoon Agent Mulder.  ,1,1
SCULLY: Something you couldn't show me at work.  ,1,1
"SCULLY: Which was what, exactly?  ",1,1
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,1,1
SCULLY: What reason would the military have to kidnap one of their own pilots?  ,1,1
"SCULLY: Yeah, there were rumours those pilots were shot down at high altitudes, while they were routinely penetrating Russian air space.  ",1,1
SCULLY: So?  ,1,1
"SCULLY: I don't get it Mulder. Does this have something to do with an X-File? I thought you only liked those, er, paranormal type cases. Am I missing something here?  ",1,1
SCULLY: You ok Mulder?  ,1,1
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,1,1
SCULLY: I checked on that file you gave me.  ,1,1
"SCULLY: You failed to tell me a few things. (Mulder hears clicking noises coming from his phone, he takes the phone away from his ear) This isn't some UFO goose chase, you're leading me on, is it? (Mulder listens into the phone again) Are you there Mulder?  ",1,1
"SCULLY: Did you hear what I said, because the bureau has it out for us already and it would make us appear pretty stupid if my field report, read like some tabloid story.  ",1,1
SCULLY: How do you mean?  ,1,1
SCULLY: Did you ever talk to him about this?  ,1,1
SCULLY: You know that the government is not above the law. They cannot withhold information.  ,1,1
SCULLY: How long has he been...  ,1,1
"SCULLY: We'll be staying at the Beech Grove Motel if you anything, ok?  ",1,1
"SCULLY: Mmm, it's called sterioptathy, it's a syndrome produced by extreme stress. POWs have been known to suffer from it, they've studied it in zoo animals.  ",1,1
SCULLY: Ever hear of something called The Aurora Project?  ,1,1
"SCULLY: The Pentagon has all but admitted, they've been testing a secret class of sub-orbital spy craft over the western US. Maybe, these guys are flying those planes. Maybe, these guys are the washouts.  ",1,1
"SCULLY: Yeah, somebody named Colonel Kissel will meet with us, a week from Friday.  ",1,1
SCULLY: Good thing we still kept that appointment.  ,1,1
SCULLY: Sucker.  ,1,1
SCULLY: Catch ye outside.  ,1,1
"SCULLY: Wanna see something weird, Mulder? Ellens Air Base isn't even on my US GS quadrant map.  ",1,1
SCULLY: You know. Where are we going?  ,1,1
SCULLY: What do you honestly hope to see?  ,1,1
"SCULLY: Is this why we came out here, Mulder? To look for UFOs. (Mulder is walking up a grassy embankment) Yea, this is gonna look real good on my field report.  ",1,1
SCULLY: Aaaaaah!  ,1,1
SCULLY: Unnh!  ,1,1
SCULLY: What are they?  ,1,1
SCULLY: That's unreal. I've never seen anything like it.  ,1,1
"SCULLY: Well, it can't be aircraft. Aircraft can't manoeuvre like that.  ",1,1
"SCULLY: I don't know, lasers maybe. Being shot from the ground, reflecting up off the clouds. (The two lights fly up through the clouds and disappear. Scully turns to face Mulder, her expression is one of amazement) Oh my God.  ",1,1
"SCULLY: That's not a plane, that's a helicopter.  ",1,1
"SCULLY: So, what exactly were you guys doing in there?  ",1,1
SCULLY: What's that?  ,1,1
"SCULLY: You believe it all, don't you?  ",1,1
"SCULLY: Mulder, did you see their eyes? If I were that stoned I...  ",1,1
"SCULLY: Mulder, you could have shown that kid a picture of a flying hamburger and he would have told you that's exactly what he saw.  ",1,1
"SCULLY: Mulder, are you suggesting that the military is flying UFOs.  ",1,1
"SCULLY: Mulder, c'mon. You've got two blurry photos, one of them taken almost fifty years ago, and another one, you purchased today in a roadside diner. You're going out on a pretty big limb.  ",1,1
"SCULLY: Tell me, one good reason why either of these photos is authentic.  ",1,1
"SCULLY: Just because I can't explain it, doesn't mean I'm gonna believe they were UFOs.  ",1,1
"SCULLY: Mulder, you're crazy. (Mulder chuckles) And it still doesn't explain to me, what happened to Colonel Budahas.  ",1,1
SCULLY: Thanks.  ,1,1
SCULLY: You ready for this.  ,1,1
"SCULLY: We got a message from Mrs. Budahas, her husband came home last night.  ",1,1
SCULLY: We got your message.  ,1,1
SCULLY: What is it?  ,1,1
"SCULLY: Mulder, would you explain to me what's going on.  ",1,1
"SCULLY: The brain doesn't work like that, Mulder. You can't just go in and erase certain files.  ",1,1
SCULLY: There are types of amnesia th..  ,1,1
"SCULLY: All I'm saying, is that the science or medical technology to do what you are suggesting, does not exist.  ",1,1
"SCULLY: Even if they could, why would they do such a thing?  ",1,1
SCULLY: It couldn't just be that he had a nervous breakdown with a concomitant memory lapse?  ,1,1
SCULLY: What the hell is th..  ,1,1
SCULLY: Federal Agents.  ,1,1
"SCULLY: Nothing under Idaho plate CC1356, no plate registered under that number. Thanks Gayle, no no no, I'm sure the other one's bogus too, bye. (Mulder is lying on the bed) So who were those guys?  ",1,1
SCULLY: Something else.  ,1,1
SCULLY: What!  ,1,1
"SCULLY: If, if that were true, it would be a national scandal.  ",1,1
"SCULLY: Did you ever stop to think that what we saw was simply an experimental plane. Like the stealth bomber or, this Aurora Project. Doesn't the government have a right and a responsibility, to protect it's secrets?  ",1,1
"SCULLY: Look, these are questions we have no business asking. Our kidnap victim is no longer outstanding. Let's get out of here Mulder, while you still have a job.  ",1,1
"SCULLY: Mulder, where are you going?  ",1,1
"SCULLY: Yeah, I'm, I'm trying to make a call to Washington D.C. an, and I can't seem to get a long distance line. (Her phone suddenly goes dead) Hello? Hello? (Scully puts the phone down beside her holstered gun and goes over to the motel reception office) Excuse me. Erm, my phone's not working, can I use yours to make a credit card call, please?  ",1,1
SCULLY: This one's not working either.  ,1,1
SCULLY: Thanks.  ,1,1
SCULLY: I was in the lobby trying to make a call.  ,1,1
SCULLY: Yeah.  ,1,1
"SCULLY: Get on the car. Hands on the car, do it.  ",1,1
"SCULLY: I said, hands against the car. Who are you?  ",1,1
SCULLY: Where's Mulder?  ,1,1
SCULLY: I want you to get on that walkie-talkie and find out where Mulder is.  ,1,1
"SCULLY: I think you can, or I'm gonna have every newspaper in America out here, writing about your experimental aircraft.  ",1,1
"SCULLY: Yeah, I've already seen where you get with tears and a sad story.  ",1,1
SCULLY: What are we doing?  ,1,1
"SCULLY: I want the car running. I said start the car. (Paul starts the car) And put your hands on the wheel, where I can see them.  ",1,1
"SCULLY: Yeah, you just keep telling yourself that.  ",1,1
"SCULLY: I want you to keep the car running, and step out of the car. (Both Paul and Scully get out of the car, Scully keeps the gun pointed at Paul as she moves around the car and behind him) Get in the car Mulder. Get in the car.  ",1,1
SCULLY: You ok Mulder?  ,1,1
SCULLY: What?  ,1,1
"SCULLY: That's enough Mulder. We don't know anything. Anything more than when we got here, and that's what I gonna write in my field report. Let's get outta here Mulder, as fast as we can.  ",1,1
SCULLY: J. Edgar Jr?  ,1,2
SCULLY: Supervisory?  ,1,2
"SCULLY: Two years out of the academy, how'd he land that?  ",1,2
"SCULLY: Well, good for Marty.  ",1,2
"SCULLY: Brad Wilson told me, the pyshological profile you wrote on the Washington Crossing Killer led them straight to the suspect. Word has it, you're on the Violent Crime Section's fast track.  ",1,2
SCULLY: Is that what everyone thinks I do?  ,1,2
SCULLY: Mulder's ideas maybe a bit out there but he is a great agent.  ,1,2
SCULLY: I take it there's a pattern?  ,1,2
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,1,2
SCULLY: Suicides?  ,1,2
SCULLY: Bare hands. This looks like an X-file.  ,1,2
SCULLY: Do you want me to ask Mulder?  ,1,2
"SCULLY: They're friends of mine from the academy, I'm sure they just felt more comfortable talking to me.  ",1,2
SCULLY: It probably has to do with your reputation.  ,1,2
"SCULLY: Mulder, look. Colton plays by the book and you don't. They feel your methods, your theories are...  ",1,2
"SCULLY: We just got here. Er, Fox Mulder, Tom Colton.  ",1,2
"SCULLY: Ten murders, Colton never mentioned..  ",1,2
"SCULLY: Are you saying, these prints are from the 1960's and the 1930's?  ",1,2
SCULLY: Of course.  ,1,2
SCULLY: You're saying these are copy-cats.  ,1,2
SCULLY: Are you suggesting that I go before the Violent Crime Section and present a profile declaring that these murders were done by aliens?  ,1,2
"SCULLY: Well, what then? That, that this is the work of a hundred year old serial killer who is capable of overpowering a healthy six foot two businessman.  ",1,2
"SCULLY: Look, bottom line, this is Colton's case.  ",1,2
"SCULLY: Mulder, they don't want you involved. They don't want to hear your theories. That's why Blevins has you hidden away down here.  ",1,2
"SCULLY: Position ten, I copy.  ",1,2
"SCULLY: Mulder, what the hell are you doing here?  ",1,2
"SCULLY: Mulder, you are jeopardising my stakeout.  ",1,2
SCULLY: Position ten requesting backup.  ,1,2
"SCULLY: Federal Agent, I'm armed. Proceed down the vent, slowly.  ",1,2
SCULLY: It still doesn't explain what he was doing there that late at night.  ,1,2
"SCULLY: He was crawling up an air duct, by himself, without alerting security.  ",1,2
"SCULLY: Tom, I wanna thank you for letting me put in some time with the VCS, but I am officially assigned to the X-files.  ",1,2
"SCULLY: Tom, I can look out for myself.  ",1,2
"SCULLY: You knew they wouldn't believe you, why did you push it?  ",1,2
"SCULLY: It seems like you were acting very territorial, I don't know, forget it.  ",1,2
"SCULLY: Er, I don't know, you must have something more than your polygraph interpretation to backup this bizarre theory and I have to see what it is.  ",1,2
SCULLY: How could that be?  ,1,2
SCULLY: Tom. We have authorized access to this crime scene. A report of you obstructing another officer's investigation might stick out on your personnel file.  ,1,2
SCULLY: The victim's.  ,1,2
"SCULLY: The victim is a Thomas Werner, single, white..  ",1,2
"SCULLY: Baltimore PD checked out Tooms' apartment, it was a cover. No one has ever lived there and he hasn't shown up for work since he was arrested.  ",1,2
SCULLY: Apartment 2 0 3. He killed the guy above him.  ,1,2
"SCULLY: Well, this must be Tooms' great grandfather.  ",1,2
"SCULLY: Genetics might explain the patterns, it also might explain the sociopathic attitudes and behaviours. It begins with one family member, who raises an offspring, who raises the next child.  ",1,2
"SCULLY: Well, what do you think?  ",1,2
SCULLY: 2023.  ,1,2
"SCULLY: Nope, he disappeared off the face of the earth. You?  ",1,2
"SCULLY: At least in Baltimore County. No, I did find one thing though, erm, it's the current address of the investigating officer at the Powhatan Mill murders in 1933.  ",1,2
SCULLY: Sir?  ,1,2
SCULLY: Unofficially?  ,1,2
SCULLY: A piece of the removed liver?  ,1,2
SCULLY: Here's 103.  ,1,2
SCULLY: There's nothing here.  ,1,2
SCULLY: I don't know.  ,1,2
SCULLY: Frank said he collected trophies.  ,1,2
SCULLY: It looks like the wall's deteriorating.  ,1,2
"SCULLY: This looks like the opening, think there's anything inside?  ",1,2
SCULLY: No one could live in this.  ,1,2
SCULLY: Hibernates?  ,1,2
SCULLY: Mulder.  ,1,2
"SCULLY: In any case, he's not here now and he's gotta come back.  ",1,2
"SCULLY: Yeah, that'll take some fannagling.  ",1,2
"SCULLY: Oh, wait, I'm snagged on something, oh, it's ok, I got it.  ",1,2
SCULLY: I have to meet Mulder..  ,1,2
SCULLY: It isn't in any way interferring with your investigation.  ,1,2
SCULLY: You can't do that.  ,1,2
SCULLY: Is this what it takes to climb the ladder Colton?  ,1,2
SCULLY: Then I can't wait `til you fall off and land on your ass.  ,1,2
"SCULLY: Mulder, you must've gone out since Colton gave us the night off, I say we file a complaint against him, I am furious. Call me when you get in, ok, bye.  ",1,2
"SCULLY: You'll be interested to know that I've ordered some genetic tests. The preliminary medical exam revealed quite abnormal development in the muscular and  skeletal systems, as well as a continually declining metabolic rate. It dips way below the  levels registered in deep sleep. Did you hear what I said Mulder?  ",1,2
"SCULLY: Sioux City, Iowa. That's the first I've heard of it.  ",1,3
SCULLY: I don't understand.  ,1,3
SCULLY: He must have more evidence than..  ,1,3
"SCULLY: I admit, that is strange. Even for Mulder.  ",1,3
SCULLY: An X-File.  ,1,3
"SCULLY: She was his sister, she disappeared twenty-one years ago, he was, twelve and she was eight. He claims that he was in the room when it happened. He recalls a, bright light outside the window and er, and a presence in the room.  ",1,3
"SCULLY: In my opinion, no.  ",1,3
"SCULLY: With respect sir, at least let me talk with him, and make a recommendation.  ",1,3
"SCULLY: It just doesn't seem, substantial enough to warrant an investigation.  ",1,3
"SCULLY: Well, at least if we had a legitimate source, we could..  ",1,3
"SCULLY: But what makes this case anymore credible, than...(Scully lifts a copy of National Comet, from were the article attached to Mulder's 3-0-2 was taken, off Mulder's desk and reads another cover feature)...the hundred year old mother with the lizard baby?  ",1,3
SCULLY: Oko-what?  ,1,3
SCULLY: Is that supposed to mean something to me?  ,1,3
SCULLY: Define hotspot.  ,1,3
SCULLY: The pilot took that photograph?  ,1,3
"SCULLY: Lisa Tyrell, Bonnie Winston, Dorreen McAllister, Darlene Mor...  ",1,3
"SCULLY: Miss Darlene Morris? (Scully shows her id) I'm Agent Scully and this is Agent Fox Mulder, we talked with you on the phone last night.  ",1,3
SCULLY: Hmmm.  ,1,3
"SCULLY: Miss Morris, during the divorce, was there a custody battle?  ",1,3
SCULLY: How can you be so sure?  ,1,3
SCULLY: I just think it's a good idea not to antagonise local law enforcement.  ,1,3
"SCULLY: You never know, we might need his help one of these days.  ",1,3
SCULLY: That's right. Who are you?  ,1,3
SCULLY: Are you a friend of Ruby's?  ,1,3
SCULLY: And she liked to hang out with you?  ,1,3
SCULLY: Do you know what they were planning to do about it?  ,1,3
SCULLY: You know Greg from School?  ,1,3
SCULLY: This is the motel we'll be staying at if you hear of anything.  ,1,3
SCULLY: What?  ,1,3
"SCULLY: Mulder, they're NSA. (Mulder puts on his jacket) They think the boy may be a threat to national security.  ",1,3
"SCULLY: Well how did Kevin obtain top secret information? And, where do you think he got it from?  ",1,3
SCULLY: What is it?  ,1,3
SCULLY: And none of the information is actionable?  ,1,3
SCULLY: So it's just a random set of ones and zeroes.  ,1,3
SCULLY: I don't understand.  ,1,3
SCULLY: That's from the Brandenburg concertos.  ,1,3
SCULLY: This has been a terrible mistake. And I assure you that the government will pay for all repairs and damages.  ,1,3
SCULLY: I thought we were headed back into town. (Mulder shakes his head slightly) Where are we going?  ,1,3
SCULLY: The key to what?  ,1,3
SCULLY: Agent Atsumi said it was a statistical aberration.  ,1,3
"SCULLY: Ok, I admit it, it's not much of an explanation but it..  ",1,3
SCULLY: A conduit.  ,1,3
SCULLY: But how?  ,1,3
SCULLY: Mulder I know what you're thinking. I know why this is so important to you. (Mulder looks at Scully) I know. But there is no evidence indicating an abduction.  ,1,3
SCULLY: Just a stones throw from the forest wall.  ,1,3
SCULLY: Meaning anybody could've come out of the forest to grab her.  ,1,3
"SCULLY: Or an electrical storm. (Mulder is looking through some shells on the waterfront) Besides which, there's nothing to connect it to the night of Ruby's disappearance.  ",1,3
"SCULLY: Mulder, look.  ",1,3
"SCULLY: Mulder what are you doing? (Mulder continues to move the stones) Mulder, you are disturbing a crime scene. (Mulder is still moving the stones, Scully grabs Mulder's arm) Stop.  ",1,3
SCULLY: You ok Mulder?  ,1,3
SCULLY: Ruby's boyfriend.  ,1,3
"SCULLY: Look at that, it's her, the girl from the library.  ",1,3
SCULLY: We didn't get her name but she claimed Greg and Ruby had run off together.  ,1,3
"SCULLY: Have a seat Tessa. (Tessa sits down and the door is shut. The letters on the door read `INTERROGATION ROOM'. Inside the room on the table, sits a tape recorder which is recording. Scully sits down opposite Tessa) We know that you lied to us the other day. We know that you had the appointment with Doctor Fowler on August 7th. We know that you're the one that's pregnant, not Ruby.  ",1,3
"SCULLY: We can prove it Tessa, and we can prove that Greg, was the father.  ",1,3
"SCULLY: This is very serious. Do you understand how serious this is? (Tessa just looks away from Scully) Now you've waived the right to an attorney, so if you lie to us here today, you could be charged with perjury.  ",1,3
"SCULLY: You said that he and Ruby were seeing each other. You said that they were planning to meet at the lake, is that true?  ",1,3
SCULLY: Mulder you're not seeing the whole picture here.  ,1,3
"SCULLY: Which is that all likelihood, Ruby is dead.  ",1,3
SCULLY: They're searching the national park and a rescue dive team is coming in from Des Moines to drag the lake.  ,1,3
SCULLY: Do you really think Tessa Seers is telling the truth?  ,1,3
"SCULLY: She lied to us in the library, she lied to us about her pregnancy, what makes you think she wouldn't lie to us about killing Ruby?  ",1,3
"SCULLY: We have a suspect in custody, we have a confession to one murder, and we have a statement which speaks to the intent to commit another. It's over Mulder. It's time to go home and turn this over to local law enforcement.  ",1,3
SCULLY: Mulder where are you going?  ,1,3
SCULLY: Darlene won't even let you in the door.  ,1,3
"SCULLY: They don't wanna have anything to do with you...us. (Scully stops and call after Mulder) Mulder stop. Stop running after your sister. (Mulder stops, and then turns around to face Scully again) This won't bring her back.  ",1,3
"SCULLY: Kevin? (Mulder notices something on the floor and turns off the TV. On the floor are sheets of paper with binary sequences on them, they are placed in a square shape. Scully hears the kettle boiling and goes into the kitchen and takes it off the stove. She walks back into the living room and looks at the papers) Mulder. (Mulder is sitting down staring at the papers) What does it mean?  ",1,3
"SCULLY: I'm gonna check upstairs. (Scully goes upstairs and glances over the bannister, as she does she notices something about the papers) Oh my god.  ",1,3
"SCULLY: Just come up here. (Mulder goes up the stairs) Look, (Mulder looks at the papers and sees that the binary sequences make a face) it's her, it's Ruby.  ",1,3
"SCULLY: This is a longshot Mulder, they could be anywhere.  ",1,3
"SCULLY: Look, there's a trail ahead.  ",1,3
SCULLY: Go ahead.  ,1,3
SCULLY: MULDER!  ,1,3
SCULLY: She's unconcious but she's still alive.  ,1,3
SCULLY: Nurse says she been awake for almost an hour.  ,1,3
"SCULLY: Eerrr, there's no sign of head trauma, no narcotic traces or electralight abnormalities, but her white blood cell count was skyhigh.  ",1,3
"SCULLY: Errmmm, actually both, how did you know that?  ",1,3
SCULLY: Hi. (Mulder and Scully enter the room) Hi Ruby.  ,1,3
"SCULLY: Ooh, we're with the FBI, I'm Special Agent Dana Scully and this is Fox Mulder.  ",1,3
SCULLY: How are you feeling?  ,1,3
"SCULLY: You're right, we should wait until Ruby gets a little stronger.  ",1,3
SCULLY: Working hard Mulder?  ,1,4
"SCULLY: Anti-gravity's right. (Mulder throws the magazine onto the desk) Sorry to interrupt your serious investigation, but I just heard a story that'd just about take your knees out.  ",1,4
"SCULLY: They found a body in the New Jersey woods yesterday, missing it's right arm and shoulder. They think they may have been eaten off, by a human.  ",1,4
SCULLY: Just outside Atlantic City.  ,1,4
"SCULLY: Mmma, it was a homeless man. There doesn't seem to be a motive.  ",1,4
"SCULLY: Relative to whom? (Mulder is looking in a drawer in his office) It's not our case Mulder, the local police are handling it. (Mulder pulls out a file) An X-File?  ",1,4
"SCULLY: Yeah, it's a beast that's supposed to come out of the woods and attack cars, right. Kind of like an East Coast Bigfoot.  ",1,4
SCULLY: Save me the trouble.  ,1,4
SCULLY: Is the autopsy report in here?  ,1,4
"SCULLY: Mulder it's the same story I've heard since I was a kid. It's a folk tale, a myth.  ",1,4
SCULLY: Was he alive when it happened?  ,1,4
"SCULLY: Hi, I'm Special Agent Dana Scully and this is Agent Fox Mulder.  ",1,4
"SCULLY: Agent Mulder, we should go.  ",1,4
"SCULLY: He was perfectly in his rights. The FBI has no overriding jurisdiction in a murder case. Anyway, you'd feel the same way if someone was horning in on your work.  ",1,4
"SCULLY: You missed your opening Mulder, you could've really humiliated him and er, told him who the perpetrator was, The Jersey Devil. (Mulder laughs)  ",1,4
SCULLY: You're kidding right.  ,1,4
SCULLY: Mulder I have to be back in D.C.  ,1,4
"SCULLY: No, I have my godson's birthday party at 6:30. (Mulder throws the car keys across the top of the car, Scully catches them) What are you doing?  ",1,4
"SCULLY: Mulder, it's a three hour drive back by myself...(Mulder waves to Scully)...in Friday night traffic, ooowh.  ",1,4
"SCULLY: Oh c'mon, it's ok, it's alright, what happened, did you bump your head? Hhmmm.  ",1,4
SCULLY: Jungle warfare.  ,1,4
SCULLY: If the hit squad doesn't get to him before you do.  ,1,4
"SCULLY: Oooh, you're amazing.  ",1,4
"SCULLY: You're just such a natural at all this, I don't know how you keep it all together.  ",1,4
"SCULLY: Mmmm, I don't think I'm cut out for this El.  ",1,4
SCULLY: When am I supposed to find the time?  ,1,4
SCULLY: Ooooh.  ,1,4
SCULLY: Know of any?  ,1,4
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,1,4
"SCULLY: He's a jerk. He's not a jerk, he's erm, he's obsessed with his work.  ",1,4
SCULLY: Hi.  ,1,4
"SCULLY: Oh, come in.  ",1,4
SCULLY: Where are you?  ,1,4
SCULLY: You're still in Atlantic City?  ,1,4
SCULLY: What's that noise in the background?  ,1,4
"SCULLY: Mulder where are you? (We see Scully again, Mulder has just told her where he is) The drunk tank.  ",1,4
"SCULLY: Well, it's not hard to see why they mistook you for a vagrant.  ",1,4
SCULLY: Am I buying or did you manage to pan-handle some spare change while you were at it?  ,1,4
SCULLY: Mulder.  ,1,4
SCULLY: What's gonna happen when word of this gets back to the bureau?  ,1,4
SCULLY: I'm talking about this Jersey Devil thing.  ,1,4
"SCULLY: Hyeah, I'll say.  ",1,4
"SCULLY: Mulder, listen to yourself. You're already ascribing it a motive and an alibi. This thing, chewing somebody's arm off is not exactly a defensive posture.  ",1,4
"SCULLY: You saw something, I'll give you that but I'm not about to go in and sell it. Not when it's nothing more than a sighting in a dark alley.  ",1,4
"SCULLY: Yeah well, I have got to get back to Washington by 7:30, so er..  ",1,4
SCULLY: No. I have a date.  ,1,4
"SCULLY: Unlike you Mulder, I would like to have a life.  ",1,4
"SCULLY: C'mon, I have somebody I want you to meet, on the way home. C'mon.  ",1,4
"SCULLY: Yeah, humans are top carnivores, we sit at the top of the food chain and we, reduce other species' chance of survival.  ",1,4
SCULLY: I'm sure.  ,1,4
SCULLY: That's what they say.  ,1,4
SCULLY: Yeah.  ,1,4
SCULLY: I don't think it's a case we should discuss over dinner.  ,1,4
SCULLY: Eef-hhmmm. (Scully's beeper goes off) Sorry. (She opens her handbag and checks the message on the beeper. She closes her bag again and gets up from the table) Excuse me.  ,1,4
SCULLY: Mulder.  ,1,4
"SCULLY: That's ok, what's up?  ",1,4
SCULLY: I'm afraid we may have called you down here for nothing.  ,1,4
"SCULLY: Maybe, she spends her day shopping.  ",1,4
"SCULLY: Mulder, we've put men into space, we've built computers that work faster than the human mind.  ",1,4
"SCULLY: No I was just, thinking about my godson's birthday party, eight little six year old boys running around, talk about primitive behaviour.  ",1,4
SCULLY: Mulder? Mulder where are you?  ,1,4
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,1,4
"SCULLY: Lay back. Oh, Mulder you're hurt.  ",1,4
"SCULLY: Yeah well, she just about ripped your lungs out.  ",1,4
SCULLY: Yeah I need to talk somebody who can get me federal jurisdiction on this case. Mulder.  ,1,4
"SCULLY: The US assistant D.A.'s on the phone with the bureau right now, he wants to know what the hell is going on up here in Atlantic City.  ",1,4
SCULLY: The Atlantic City major crime unit has filed a complaint that we're endangering a murder investigation.  ,1,4
"SCULLY: Hi, this just came through, it's the posthumous medical exam on the woman's body. They found fragments of human bones still in her digestive tract, they estimated her age to be twenty-five to thirty years. Now they allowed Dr. Diamond to do a medical exam of the body but he found nothing that suggested prehistoric bone structure or physiology. Now the ACPD has her listed as a Jane Doe, and a search for her identity in state psychiatric records has begun, in earnest.  ",1,4
"SCULLY: They have also released the medical exam from the male body that they found, his age is estimated to be about forty years.  ",1,4
SCULLY: The medical exam of the women's uterus does seem to indicate that she may have given birth.  ,1,4
"SCULLY: Mulder will you do me a favour, will you just go out and have a beer, will you take the day off. I'll cover for you, will you just, take some time for yourself.  ",1,4
SCULLY: Hello?  ,1,4
SCULLY: Oh hi.  ,1,4
SCULLY: A guy.  ,1,4
SCULLY: Same guy.  ,1,4
SCULLY: I don't think so.  ,1,4
SCULLY: Not at this time.  ,1,4
SCULLY: I'm going with you to the Smithsonian.  ,1,4
SCULLY: Keep that up Mulder and I'll hurt you like that beast-woman.  ,1,4
SCULLY: Look who's holding the door.  ,1,4
SCULLY: Any sign of external legions or surface burns?  ,1,5
"SCULLY: Well, it can't be long. The body's still warm.  ",1,5
"SCULLY: If you've conducted your investigation, why consult us?  ",1,5
SCULLY: Who do you think they were?  ,1,5
SCULLY: How can the esophagus be crushed without the neck even being touched?  ,1,5
SCULLY: Psychokinesis? You mean how Carrie got even at the prom?  ,1,5
"SCULLY: Ok, I'm intrigued. How can we investigate, we have nothing to go on. (Mulder puts his arm around her shoulders and brings his eyeglasses up and exhales on them. There is a perfect fingerprint on each lens.  ",1,5
SCULLY: He has ties to extremist group operating in the US. The Isfahan. They take their name from a city in Iran. Recently they've been working out of Philadelphia.  ,1,5
SCULLY: I'll talk to the Philly P.D.  ,1,5
SCULLY: Who discovered their bodies?  ,1,5
SCULLY: We'll just have to interview everyone who was at the machine before 10 last night. (We see Lauren at the machine and being dragged off by the two attackers at 9:45.)  ,1,5
"SCULLY: (reading in her file) Lauren Kyte. 858 Franklin, Bensalem. Why would the Isfahan being robbing someone for 40 bucks at an ATM machine?  ",1,5
SCULLY: It's another person.  ,1,5
"SCULLY: Well, the resolution is too poor. It won't help much to enhance it.  ",1,5
SCULLY: Have you seen either of these two men before?  ,1,5
SCULLY: Take your time.  ,1,5
SCULLY: I'm afraid you have. (Scully shows her another picture) This is a surveillance picture from your ATM. (It's a picture of Lauren and the attackers. Their faces clear.)  ,1,5
SCULLY: Have you ever seen this person before? (It's the still frame from the surveillance video of the spectral image)  ,1,5
SCULLY: She knows who the other person in that photo is.  ,1,5
SCULLY: What the hell's going on?  ,1,5
"SCULLY: Yeah. (Mulder looks over at the other driver, shaking his head wondering what happened. Lauren is still looking out the window and she pulls the drapes when Mulder sees her.)  ",1,5
SCULLY: Yeah. I'm fine. Except I have a waiting-in-line-at-the-DMV-sized headache.  ,1,5
SCULLY: They check out the car?  ,1,5
SCULLY: Then someone tampered with it while we were in her house.  ,1,5
SCULLY: They are on.  ,1,5
SCULLY: She was in our presence the entire time we were at her house.  ,1,5
"SCULLY: If a person could generate that much energy, their body would break down. They'd start glowing like those lights.  ",1,5
SCULLY: Are you saying Lauren Kyte crashed our car?  ,1,5
"SCULLY: They're here... (imitation of the little girl from the movie, ""Poltergeist"")  ",1,5
"SCULLY: Oh, come on Mulder, look at the tangible evidence. Two Mid-East extremists are killed trying to assault a woman working for a manufacturer of parts for the Defense Department. While we questioned her our car is sabotaged. Now in both those cases, someone else may have committed those acts. Maybe the same someone we saw in those ATM photos. The mystery isn't psychokinetic energy, it's her accomplice. (They both notice the lights of the car are out.)  ",1,5
"SCULLY: Look at this one. (There is another maker next to Howard's that reads, \'93 Sarah Lynn Graves September 8, 1966 to August 3 1969"". There's a groundskeeper planting flowers nearby.)  ",1,5
SCULLY: She was only three years old.  ,1,5
"SCULLY (VOICE OVER): Further investigation into Lauren Kyte's personal history reveals an estrangement from her family. Phone records confirm no contact with her parents for the last two years. Her actions observed during surveillance (Go back to Mulder looking at photos taken during the surveillance as Scully continues speaking) indicate a strong relationship between Lauren Kyte and her employer, the late Howard Graves. (Back to Scully typing) Was this relationship somehow the motivation for his suicide? How are the attack and the subsequent murders of the Isfahan agents related, if at all? I am certain that the answers to these questions lie in finding the identity of Lauren Kyte's accomplice. (Back to Mulder looking at the negatives of the photos. One is of Lauren Kyte's house, the next of her front window. There's a figure standing in the window.)  ",1,5
SCULLY: He and Lauren Kyte are in on something. Maybe an illegal deal through his company. Something the CIA was interested in.  ,1,5
"SCULLY: Wait, you think I'm right?  ",1,5
"SCULLY: May we see the autopsy report, please? (Ellen tosses it across the desk)  ",1,5
SCULLY: Cause of death... arterial hemorrhage...  ,1,5
SCULLY: Well there seems to be some blood work missing here.  ,1,5
SCULLY: How did you know?  ,1,5
SCULLY: Lauren Kyte.  ,1,5
"SCULLY: Yes, there is. His body's tissues and organs were donated.  ",1,5
"SCULLY: The tests are conclusive, the dura matter does belong to Howard Graves. He is indeed, very dead. (Mulder gets up and walks away)  ",1,5
SCULLY: What case? You're the ones who've been withholding information. (They all fall silent.)  ,1,5
SCULLY: But you believe it.  ,1,5
"SCULLY: That's not enough. You've been given the chance to tell him again. Take it. Tell him you love him, by showing him, by... helping us finish his unfinished business. Lauren, how will you ever be able to rest if he never can? (Lauren nods.)  ",1,5
"SCULLY: Mulder, there's no such thing as ghosts or psychokinesis. I'm sure there's an explanation. But I believe that she believes. And my priority is to get her to help us stop Dorland.  ",1,5
SCULLY: I'm giving us a chance to solve a case that's tangible instead of chasing after shadows. (Scully leaves leaving Mulder to ponder.)  ,1,5
"SCULLY: All right, everyone. We have a warrant to search the premises for evidence of the sale of restricted manufactured parts. The evidence may be in the form of falsified export licences, parts manifests, communiques. It could be on computer disks or hard copy.  ",1,5
"SCULLY: Lets go. (The man break up. Lauren walks with Scully.) Now, it will most likely be in Dorland's office. We'll conduct the search, but we need you to guide us so we need you to be strong, okay? (Scully opens the back door of the car for her. Lauren gets in. The cars pull out.)  ",1,5
"SCULLY: Mulder! (Inside the office, it's dark and we hear Scully yelling. Pictures fly from the wall. Drawers open and papers fly around the room. The letter opener hovers in front of Dorland's face. It turns and flies into the wall. It slits the wallpaper about two feet and stops. The noise and flying papers die down and Scully bolts into the room. She looks around at the mess.)  ",1,5
SCULLY: My God. (Mulder walks across the wall to wall paper to the wall and takes a floppy disk out from behind the wallpaper.)  ,1,5
"SCULLY: Out of here, or away from the ghost of Howard Graves? (They walk to the car.)  ",1,5
SCULLY: I'd settle for a life in this one.  ,1,5
SCULLY: Yes. (They get into the car and fasten their seat belts.)  ,1,5
"SCULLY: You're not missing much. It's just a big bell with a big crack, and you have to wait in a long line.  ",1,5
SCULLY: Why now?  ,1,5
"SCULLY: No, really ...  ",1,6
SCULLY: And it wasn't accidental?  ,1,6
SCULLY: Who's running the investigation?  ,1,6
SCULLY: The forensics instructor at the Academy? (to MULDER) We used to call her the Iron Maiden.  ,1,6
SCULLY: How come you two went your separate ways?  ,1,6
SCULLY: Seriously.  ,1,6
SCULLY: And you?  ,1,6
SCULLY: I know where you ended up. What about Jerry?  ,1,6
SCULLY: What kind of bad luck?  ,1,6
SCULLY: (pushing button) Twenty-nine?  ,1,6
SCULLY: Must be for the visually impaired.  ,1,6
SCULLY: Yeah. What was that?  ,1,6
SCULLY: Hello?  ,1,6
SCULLY: This is Agent Dana Scully.  ,1,6
"SCULLY: Uh, actually, I think everything's okay.  ",1,6
SCULLY: ...he completed the circuit.  ,1,6
SCULLY: And to throw a 180 pound man ten feet. (Looks at cracked mirror)  ,1,6
SCULLY: (entering) It's past three.  ,1,6
SCULLY: Maybe if you cleaned your desk more than once a year.  ,1,6
SCULLY: Come on. We're late.  ,1,6
SCULLY: (whisper to MULDER) Is that your profile?  ,1,6
SCULLY: What did he say?  ,1,6
"SCULLY: I just got off the phone with Peterson, the systems engineer. (hands MULDER a piece of paper)  ",1,6
SCULLY: He said it would be a short list. And it's headline news how much this guy despised Drake.  ,1,6
SCULLY: And fully consistent with Jerry's excellent behavioral profile.  ,1,6
SCULLY: (surprised) Brad Wilczek? (MULDER shows badge) We're with the FBI.  ,1,6
SCULLY: I take it Benjamin Drake fit into the first category.  ,1,6
SCULLY: And you had a different vision for the company?  ,1,6
SCULLY: Could you have done it?  ,1,6
SCULLY: You don't seem too worried.  ,1,6
"SCULLY VOICE OVER: Some see genius as the ability to connect the unconnected -- to make juxtapositions, to see relationships where others cannot. Is Brad Wilczek a genius? I don't know. But I do know this for certain. He has a predilection for elaborate game playing. He has an intimate knowledge of the Eurisko building and he has a demonstrable motive for killing Benjamin Drake. The question remains. But if he is so clever how do we nail him? End of field journal, October 24, 1993.  ",1,6
"SCULLY: (from the office) Mulder, take a look. (MULDER nods for JERRY to follow, then goes to SCULLY) We borrowed this from the voice biometrics lab at Georgetown. (Indicates voice analyzer.) It's a computer spectrogram capable of identifying individual speech patterns. Now this is the recording the Central Operating System made of the phone call Drake received just before he died.  ",1,6
SCULLY: And this we spliced together from a series of lectures Brad Wilczek gave at the Smithsonian last year.  ,1,6
SCULLY: Now we'll stack them. (plays them together)  ,1,6
SCULLY: Which means that he was the one that killed Drake. He had the motive and the means. And now we have the physical evidence. (Draws circles on the computer screen with a *hopefully* dry erase marker.) Judge Benson lives in Washington Heights. I can get a warrant in less than an hour.  ,1,6
SCULLY: I heard about Jerry. I'm sorry.  ,1,6
SCULLY: What?  ,1,6
SCULLY: To destroy evidence. To cover his tracks.  ,1,6
"SCULLY: Mulder, you've been through a lot - - more than I think even you realize.  ",1,6
SCULLY: (after deep breath) He just signed a confession. How much proof do you need?  ,1,6
"SCULLY: Mulder, don't you see, blaming the machine is an alibi, and a bad one.  ",1,6
SCULLY: So the machine killed Drake out of self-defense?  ,1,6
"SCULLY: Mulder, that level of artificial intelligence is decades away from being realized.  ",1,6
"SCULLY: (pulling him aside) Mulder, I think you're looking for something that isn't there. And I think it has something to do with Jerry. Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea if you talked to someone.  ",1,6
SCULLY: Where are you going?  ,1,6
SCULLY ASLEEP. CLOCK 1:31. Phone rings. SCULLY picks it up)  ,1,6
SCULLY: Hello?  ,1,6
"SCULLY: Oh my God. (Dials out on another line.) This is Special Agent Dana Scully, ID number 2317-616. I need you to run a quick trace on a number for me. Yeah, 202-555-6431. Yeah, that's my number. Somebody's accessing my computer.  ",1,6
SCULLY: Mulder!  ,1,6
SCULLY: Someone or something's been scanning my computer files. Tapping my phones. I traced the line. It came from somewhere in there.  ,1,6
SCULLY: How can we get in?  ,1,6
SCULLY: Mulder!  ,1,6
"SCULLY: Oh, great. Mulder?  ",1,6
SCULLY: What are you doing?  ,1,6
SCULLY: Unh....  ,1,6
SCULLY: Ahhhhh!!!!!  ,1,6
SCULLY: (don't mess with me attitude) Put down the gun.  ,1,6
SCULLY: Shut up and drop the gun.  ,1,6
"SCULLY: (after a pause) Mulder, put in the disc.  ",1,6
SCULLY: What happened up there?  ,1,7
SCULLY: Is it severe isolation distress?  ,1,7
SCULLY: There's no football on Wednesday.  ,1,7
"SCULLY: Dr. DaSilva, Dr. Hodge?  ",1,7
"SCULLY: Hi, Agent Mulder, Agent Scully...  ",1,7
SCULLY: I assume you all took a look at the tape.  ,1,7
SCULLY: Where do we start?  ,1,7
SCULLY: Flashing.  ,1,7
SCULLY: You okay?  ,1,7
SCULLY: Look at this. Black nodules. Swollen lymph nodes.  ,1,7
SCULLY: This dog has got a skin irritation on it's neck.  ,1,7
"SCULLY: Look at this, look at this!  ",1,7
"SCULLY: From the autopsies, it's clear that these men killed each other. There are contusions around the throat areas of three men, evidence of strangulation.  ",1,7
SCULLY: No. None of them had the black nodules.  ,1,7
SCULLY: I analyzed two samples.  ,1,7
SCULLY: There seems to be a presence of ammonium hydroxide in Richter's blood sample.  ,1,7
SCULLY: That same thing is in Richter's blood.  ,1,7
SCULLY: The evidence is there.  ,1,7
"SCULLY: Hey, look, there's only one way to proceed. A good doctor eliminates every possibility. We must determine if any of us is infected.  ",1,7
SCULLY: We can't let him leave without him being checked.  ,1,7
"SCULLY: Well, we don't have time to argue about it.  ",1,7
SCULLY: What are you gonna do?  ,1,7
SCULLY: He's dead.  ,1,7
SCULLY: All of the other dead bodies had the creature. This is the only one that's still alive.  ,1,7
SCULLY: No. It appears that they were in the hypothalamus gland deep in the brain.  ,1,7
SCULLY: It's a gland that secretes hormones although I don't know why a parasite would want to attach to it.  ,1,7
"SCULLY: Well, a parasite shouldn't want to kill it's host.  ",1,7
SCULLY: If the worm makes people violently aggresive then why did Richter and Campbell kill themselves?  ,1,7
"SCULLY: I'm just, uh... double-checking. Making sure I didn't miss anything.  ",1,7
SCULLY: Sleep. I'm so tired I can't sleep.  ,1,7
"SCULLY: Mulder, I don't want to waste a second trying to find a way to kill this thing.  ",1,7
SCULLY: No.  ,1,7
"SCULLY: Mulder, that pilot developed surface symptoms within a few minutes. Within a few hours, that parasite had total control. What would happen if this got into the population? A city the size of New York could be infected within a few days.  ",1,7
"SCULLY: Mulder, if we don't kill it now, we run the risk of becoming Richter and Campbell with guns to our heads.  ",1,7
"SCULLY: Future? Mulder, how can you talk about the future when right now, there's... (trails off illegibly) ...or anyone has the right to?  ",1,7
SCULLY: ...about them posing a biological hazard!  ,1,7
"SCULLY: It can! By extermination, we should take those bodies, worms and all, outside and incinerate them!  ",1,7
"SCULLY: Yes, I'm fine. It's nothing.  ",1,7
SCULLY: What the hell are you trying to say?  ,1,7
SCULLY: No. We do them in front of each other. No secrets.  ,1,7
"SCULLY: Good night, Mulder.  ",1,7
SCULLY: At least everyone's okay.  ,1,7
"SCULLY: Mulder, what are you doing?  ",1,7
"SCULLY: No, he said he didn't do it.  ",1,7
"SCULLY: You checked him yourself, Hodge.  ",1,7
"SCULLY: Stop it! Just stop it, shut up!  ",1,7
SCULLY: Then just turn around and let us take a look at your neck!  ,1,7
SCULLY: Mulder!  ,1,7
"SCULLY: Mulder, you have to understand!  ",1,7
SCULLY: You put it down first!  ,1,7
SCULLY: Mulder... you may not be who you are.  ,1,7
SCULLY: You know what I was doing.  ,1,7
SCULLY: There's four of us.  ,1,7
"SCULLY: If Mulder is infected, it's not his fault! We can't turn our backs on him now, he needs us to help him!  ",1,7
"SCULLY: This is A.I.C.P. calling Doolittle Airfield, please come in.  ",1,7
SCULLY: Hodge.  ,1,7
SCULLY: Come take a look at this. The larvae from two different worms killed each other.  ,1,7
SCULLY: Look at the evidence in the microscope. This thing does not like company.  ,1,7
SCULLY: I want to talk to him first. Try to make this voluntary.  ,1,7
"SCULLY: If anything happens, you come inside. I can't do this to him until I'm sure.  ",1,7
SCULLY: Yes.  ,1,7
SCULLY: No one's been killed since you've been in here.  ,1,7
SCULLY: We found a way to kill it. Two worms in one host will kill each other.  ,1,7
"SCULLY: (whispering) If that's true, then why didn't you let us inspect you?  ",1,7
SCULLY: (whispering) Okay. But now they're not here.  ,1,7
SCULLY: I just examined him. He's... uninfected.  ,1,7
SCULLY: Which means that it must be one of you.  ,1,7
SCULLY: Hodge! Now!  ,1,7
SCULLY: It's all right. It's all over. It all stops right here. Right now.  ,1,7
SCULLY: Who did that?  ,1,7
SCULLY: Leave it there.  ,1,7
SCULLY: What did the note say?  ,1,8
SCULLY: Why the cloak and dagger routine?  ,1,8
SCULLY: Think it's a crank?  ,1,8
SCULLY: Hi.  Special Agent Dana Scully.  ,1,8
SCULLY: What brings you to Washington?  ,1,8
SCULLY: How do you mean?  ,1,8
SCULLY: Do you have any idea who may have sent that to you?  ,1,8
SCULLY: Why would somebody want to sabotage the Space Shuttle?  ,1,8
SCULLY: And we thought we could rest easy with the fall of the Soviet Union.  ,1,8
SCULLY: Evidence of what?  ,1,8
"SCULLY: Oh, of course.  ",1,8
SCULLY: What?  ,1,8
SCULLY: You remember all that stuff?  ,1,8
SCULLY: Guess I missed that phase.  (ANOTHER CLOCK ON WALL   10:39:40...39...38...37) ,1,8
"SCULLY: Col. Belt,  I'm Special Agent Dana Scully.  (Shakes Belt's hand as he rises and puts on jacket)  And this is...  ",1,8
SCULLY:	This found its way to the FBI.  (hands Belt picture that Michelle gave them) Do you recognize it?  ,1,8
SCULLY: Do you have any reason to believe that the damage done to it was in an effort to sabotage the Space Shuttle Program?  ,1,8
SCULLY: Do you have any reason to suspect sabotage at all?  ,1,8
"SCULLY: Looking at this evidence, sir, would you consider postponing the shuttle flight until a full investigation could be conducted?  ",1,8
"SCULLY: Col. Belt, has an internal investigation ever been done on this matter?  ",1,8
SCULLY: (Shaking hands)  Thank you.  (Follows Mulder out the door)  Didn't you want to get his autograph?  ,1,8
SCULLY: It came to us anonymously.  ,1,8
SCULLY: What doesn't make sense?  ,1,8
"SCULLY: Is it conceivable that in order to avoid these delays, the program is being pushed ahead without proper safety precaution?  ",1,8
SCULLY: And who makes the final determination as to its safety?  ,1,8
SCULLY: (Quietly) What do you think?  ,1,8
SCULLY: You think Col Belt knows more than he's saying?  That he lied about his knowledge of a saboteur?  ,1,8
SCULLY: So you think this x-ray is bogus?  ,1,8
"SCULLY: Yeah, it ranks right up there with getting a pony and learning how to braid my own hair.  ",1,8
SCULLY: Do you think this is sabotage?  ,1,8
"SCULLY: Yeah, but they usually fix them, right?  ",1,8
SCULLY: She's turning.  ,1,8
SCULLY: Michelle!  ,1,8
SCULLY: Can you move?  ,1,8
SCULLY: Be careful.  ,1,8
SCULLY: It's okay.  Now don't try to move.  ,1,8
SCULLY: Was it some kind of an animal?  ,1,8
SCULLY: You okay?  ,1,8
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,1,8
SCULLY: Is it going to work?  (Mulder looks doubtful)  ,1,8
"SCULLY: What just happened?  (Wake up, Scully)  ",1,8
SCULLY: (to Michelle)  How did he know what he did was going to work?  ,1,8
SCULLY: Why would he take that risk?  ,1,8
SCULLY: So much for your boyhood hero. ,1,8
SCULLY: Why does she need Belt?  ,1,8
SCULLY: It's an oxygen leak.  Even I can figure out what happens when you run out of oxygen.  ,1,8
SCULLY: Where the hell is he?  ,1,8
SCULLY: I'm going to go get security. ,1,8
SCULLY: Michelle!  ,1,8
"SCULLY: I think she's right, Mulder.  You saw him in there.  He's losing it.  ",1,8
"SCULLY: Did he?  Or did he put their lives in unnecessary jeopardy?  If he can't deliver that payload, Congress is going to kill the Space Program.  ",1,8
"SCULLY: Look, Mulder.  I think somebody must have sabotaged the space shuttle because too many things have gone wrong.  I think Col. Belt knows about it and he's known about it from the beginning.  ",1,8
SCULLY: What exactly are we looking for?  ,1,8
SCULLY:	A needle in a haystack. ,1,8
"SCULLY: Mulder, I found it.  This is the same diagram that was sent to Michelle...ordered by Col. Belt.  Which means he knew about the faulty valve.  ",1,8
SCULLY: Are you saying he might have known about the Challenger defect?  ,1,8
SCULLY: Oh my God.  ,1,8
"SCULLY: He's having some kind of a seizure, Mulder.  ",1,8
SCULLY: (Suddenly remembering 7 years of med school) Give him 10 milligrams of Diazepam.  ,1,8
"SCULLY: He's going to hurt himself, Mulder.  ",1,8
"SCULLY: Mulder, you're risking an anuerysm.  ",1,8
"SCULLY: You're going to kill him, Mulder.  ",1,8
SCULLY: We've got to get him to a hospital.  ,1,8
SCULLY: They made it.  ,1,8
SCULLY: I just heard.  ,1,8
SCULLY: The doctors who examined him said he was experiencing severe dementia.  ,1,8
SCULLY: He ordered those x-rays of the damaged parts.  ,1,8
SCULLY: While simultaneously trying to kill them?  ,1,8
"SCULLY: There's an investigation, you know.  They haven't ruled out foul play.  ",1,8
"SCULLY: This isn't funny, Mulder. ",1,9
SCULLY: Who? ,1,9
SCULLY: Is that what this is about? ,1,9
SCULLY: Try explaining that to Section Cheif McGrath. He stepped over Blevins ordering a full inquiry. With a recommendation...Mulder he wants to shut down the X-files. And he wants you out of the bureau. ,1,9
SCULLY: I don't understand you Mulder. Why you're always defying protocol? Ignoring jurisdiction... ,1,9
SCULLY: Because it wasn't. What you saw was not a toxic spill. But it wasn't a UFO either. ,1,9
SCULLY: It was a downed Libyan jet with a nuclear warhead. (Mulder  laughs) Over US air space... They'd been picking up low grade levels of radiation indicating that a plutonium casing may have cracked. So to avoid mass panic... ,1,9
SCULLY: That story happens to be highly classified. ,1,9
"SCULLY: If they're searching for anyone, its probably the pilot. ",1,9
"SCULLY: Well, maybe he ejected. ",1,9
SCULLY: You can't be serious! ,1,9
"SCULLY: Mulder, the hearing is tomorrow morning at ten o'clock. ",1,9
"SCULLY: My assignment is to bring you back, not to help you dig yourself in deeper. ",1,9
SCULLY: What's going on? ,1,9
SCULLY: Who would... ,1,9
SCULLY: Get your hands up! ,1,9
SCULLY: A-mazing. ,1,9
SCULLY: Yeah. Wolf Industries supplied the CIA with all of its surveillance equipment. ,1,9
SCULLY: I'm sorry about your husband. ,1,9
"SCULLY: Mrs. Wright, we want to help you. ",1,9
SCULLY: The government can't do that. I'm sure if you appealed to... ,1,9
SCULLY: You're entitled to the truth. ,1,9
SCULLY: Does that mean Jason Wright was your patient? ,1,9
SCULLY: Did you note any cadaver acute heat rigor or heat stiffening? ,1,9
SCULLY: Lets say those men died from radiation exposure. Couldn't it have been from the cracked core of a nuclear warhead? ,1,9
"SCULLY: Yeah, so have I. In Hiroshima at Ground Zero. ",1,9
"SCULLY: Mulder I don't claim to know all the answers, but if we don't make the OPR inquest by tomorrow morning, there may not be any more X-files.  ",1,9
"SCULLY: Of course, I... ",1,9
SCULLY: I'll scrub up. (Mulder is led out)    ,1,9
SCULLY: It was terrible. We lost all but two. And they're still in critical condition on their way to the burn unit at John's Hopkins. ,1,9
"SCULLY: I don't know. And under other circumstances, I would like to find out, but we have a plane to catch in just over an hour...(heads toward door) ",1,9
SCULLY: What? (turning around) ,1,9
"SCULLY: Are you saying Max Fenig is an abductee? Mulder, the man is taking powerful anti-psychotic drugs. I saw them in his RV. ",1,9
"SCULLY: Not all of them. DILANTIN is an anti-convulsant, but MELLARIL is used exclusively to treat schitzophrenia. More than likely, Max is delusional. ",1,9
SCULLY: Okay. You pack. I'll take a look at Max...on the way to the airport.    ,1,9
"SCULLY: Come on, Mulder. Lets get this over with. ",1,9
SCULLY: Mulder - look at this. (pointing to blood on the pillow) ,1,9
SCULLY: Mulder! ,1,9
"SCULLY: Where do you think you are going? Look, if we go to the airport right now, we might make the plane. Which would at least give you half a chance of defending yourself. ",1,9
"SCULLY: Yeah, so what? ",1,9
SCULLY: They're dead.  ,1,9
SCULLY: (to CCH) What are you doing? You have a very sick man in there. ,1,9
SCULLY: He's a delusional schitzophrenic. ,1,9
SCULLY: What?! ,1,9
"SCULLY: No, sir ",1,9
"SCULLY: No, sir. ",1,9
SCULLY: Yes. ,1,9
SCULLY: Sir. Request permision to make a statement. ,1,9
"SCULLY: Sir, its unfair to judge Mulder by the same criteria... ",1,9
"SCULLY: But sir, I... ",1,9
SCULLY: Good luck ,1,9
SCULLY: Death by hypovolaemia. 95% blood loss. That's over 4 liters of blood.  ,1,10
"SCULLY: The man's daughter, 8 years old... was away from his side for no more than 10 minutes. She doesn't remember anything, there was no trace evidence found at the crime scene.  ",1,10
"SCULLY: Oh, there were two small puncture wounds.  ",1,10
SCULLY: How could that be?  ,1,10
SCULLY: But there was no sign of a struggle. How could a man just sit through a blood letting?  ,1,10
"SCULLY: Wait a minute. These X-Files indicate UFO related phenomena. Often there are related sightings in the sky near the incidences, along with surface burns...  ",1,10
"SCULLY: Mulder, why would alien beings travel light years through space in order to play doctor on cattle?  ",1,10
SCULLY: Can we talk to her now?  ,1,10
SCULLY: Hi. I know you must be feeling really sad right now. And scared. But we want to find out what happened so we can help stop whoever hurt your daddy. Okay?  ,1,10
SCULLY: Okay. Did you ever see any strangers with your daddy at home?  ,1,10
SCULLY: Did you ever see... anyone yell at your daddy or your daddy yell at them?  ,1,10
SCULLY: Can you think of anyone who would want to hurt your daddy?  ,1,10
SCULLY: Scully... Where?  ,1,10
SCULLY: Mulder...  ,1,10
SCULLY: There's been another one.  ,1,10
"SCULLY: The victim, Doug Reardon, was married with one daughter. Cause of death, hypovilemia. Mulder, this is crazy. They also found traces of the poison digitalis.  ",1,10
"SCULLY: Ah... yes. On the jugular. Time of death was estimated at 2:30 p.m. Same day, only three hours earlier than the Simmons murder.  ",1,10
SCULLY: It appears we have two serial killers working in tandem.  ,1,10
"SCULLY: Mulder, nothing beyond your leading questions to Teena Simmons substantiates a UFO mutilation theory.  ",1,10
SCULLY: Yes... The police report states that she remembers nothing. Ah... she's with her mother and family in Sacramento.  ,1,10
SCULLY: Tomorrow.  ,1,10
SCULLY: She was kidnaped from the Social Services Home around 11 p.m. last night. Looks like someone was afraid she might remember too much.  ,1,10
SCULLY: Connecticut State Troopers set up road blocks within a half an hour. Nothing.  ,1,10
SCULLY: I told them to contact us if they happen to find her.  ,1,10
SCULLY: Teena?  ,1,10
SCULLY: What's your name?  ,1,10
SCULLY: May I ask... Was Cindy adopted?  ,1,10
"SCULLY: So, I assume you have all the proper documentation. Birth certificate...  ",1,10
"SCULLY: No. Mrs. Reardon. This is not your daughter. That girl's name is Teena Simmons. She lives 3,000 miles away in Connecticut. That man, her father, was killed in the same manner as your husband.  ",1,10
SCULLY: Do you still believe this is UFO related? Cindy Reardon didn't see Red Lightening.  ,1,10
"SCULLY: Well, there seems to be the random possibility that two people can have an unrelated likeness.  ",1,10
SCULLY: The girls are the one and only link between identical murders.  ,1,10
SCULLY: Kidnaped.  ,1,10
SCULLY: Where are you going?  ,1,10
SCULLY: And you expect the pattern to continue.  ,1,10
SCULLY: Okay. I'll call the San Francisco bureau and get someone to relieve you.  ,1,10
SCULLY: Could a patient have believed she was receiving her own eggs but actually receive another without her knowledge?  ,1,10
SCULLY: Are you ever aware of having patients by the name of Claudia and Joel Simmons?  ,1,10
SCULLY: Both the Simmons are dead. And their daughter has been kidnaped. I think any information that you have that could help overrides your policy.  ,1,10
"SCULLY: You have copies of their records sent to Greenwich, CT, in 1991... They came here 9 years ago under the supervision of a Dr. Sally Kendrick?  ",1,10
SCULLY: There a problem?  ,1,10
SCULLY: And now you don't sound too thrilled.  ,1,10
SCULLY: Did you report this to the AMA?  ,1,10
SCULLY: And what happened?  ,1,10
SCULLY: Dr. Kendrick was the supervising physician in both the Reardon's and Simmons' IVF program. It seems she was experimenting at the clinic.  ,1,10
"SCULLY: Well, she must have had an accomplice to have done both murders.  ",1,10
"SCULLY: Mulder, does this mean you've abandoned your UFO connection? (to phone) Hello?  ",1,10
SCULLY: Hello?  ,1,10
SCULLY: Just a couple of clicks. Must be the wrong number.  ,1,10
"SCULLY: Mulder, you're rushing me out of the room.  ",1,10
SCULLY: You got a girl coming over?  ,1,10
SCULLY: Why the flashlights?  ,1,10
SCULLY: Sally Kendrick...  ,1,10
SCULLY: Are you Sally Kendrick?  ,1,10
SCULLY: Did you work for the Luther Stapes Center for Reproductive Medicine in 1985?  ,1,10
SCULLY: My God. It's the girls.  ,1,10
"SCULLY: Until I heard that, I was beginning to suspect the girls.  ",1,10
SCULLY: You suppose these girls have any idea of what they are?  ,1,10
"SCULLY: Mulder, let's go.  ",1,10
"SCULLY: There's someone upstairs, wait outside.  ",1,10
"SCULLY: Suspect's name is Sally Kendrick. Early 40's, 5'8, 135 pounds. Now she may have an accomplice, similar in appearance. Kendrick is driving a light blue '93 Corolla. She has exceptional strength for her size. So you must consider her armed and dangerous. Quite possibly she'll display severe psychotic behavior. The Oakland Bureau was here to orchestrate a search across the bridge.  ",1,10
SCULLY: And then what do we do?  ,1,10
"SCULLY: Okay, good. I want you to start a check on every single passenger for every flight that left the terminal over the past twelve hours. I want you to check every single terminal to make sure she's not hiding out somewhere for a later flight. And remember, she may have an accomplice.  ",1,10
SCULLY: We just found the car at the airport.  ,1,10
SCULLY: Someone else could have picked up the little girl without the manager knowing about it. The place is crawling with vacationing families. There would be hundreds of little kids running around.  ,1,10
SCULLY: That's it.   ,1,10
SCULLY: Who's they?  ,1,10
SCULLY: It's alright. We'll take care of you. You're safe with us.  ,1,10
SCULLY: Looks like the Eves mixed about 4 ounces of digitalis in each glass.  ,1,10
SCULLY: It has a sweet flavor. It's probably not even perceptible in soda.  ,1,10
SCULLY: We could take them to get checked out by a doctor.  ,1,10
SCULLY: We're going to take you back.  ,1,10
SCULLY: They've already grown so attached. It's going to be hard when Teena gets placed in foster care.  ,1,10
SCULLY: I could use some caffeine.  ,1,10
SCULLY VOICE OVER: Just a second.  ,1,10
SCULLY: Let's go.  ,1,10
"SCULLY: Um, tastes syrupy.  ",1,10
SCULLY: What?  ,1,10
SCULLY: Mulder...  ,1,10
SCULLY: We didn't drink enough to make us sick.  ,1,10
SCULLY: We are the police.  ,1,10
SCULLY: Mulder!  ,1,10
SCULLY: Did you see the twins we were with?  ,1,10
SCULLY: I forgot what it was like to spend a day in court.  ,1,11
SCULLY: It's open.  ,1,11
SCULLY: It's unlocked.  ,1,11
SCULLY: Must be an X-File.  ,1,11
SCULLY: What do you think it is?  ,1,11
SCULLY: Hello.  ,1,11
SCULLY: Three-pipe problem?  ,1,11
SCULLY: How private?  ,1,11
"SCULLY: Mulder, you just keep unfolding like a flower.  ",1,11
"SCULLY: Yeah, I noticed how you couldn't drop everything fast enough in order to help her out.  ",1,11
"SCULLY: Oh, is that what you were extending?  ",1,11
SCULLY: Something tells me you're not going to get rid of her that easily.  ,1,11
"SCULLY: So, Sherlock, is the game afoot?  ",1,11
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,1,11
SCULLY: Put me through what?  ,1,11
SCULLY: What are you talking about?  ,1,11
"SCULLY: Wait, and Phoebe knows about this?  ",1,11
"SCULLY: So she shows up knowing the power she has over you and then she makes you walk through fire, is that it?  ",1,11
SCULLY: Mulder? Are you sure you don't want me to help you out on this one?  ,1,11
"SCULLY: After reviewing the files of the Scotland Yard arson murders, two points remain unexplained. One is the use of an untraceable accelerant. The other involves the victims. Since they all burned in the presence of family members in safe surroundings, this indicates unusually intimate access to the victims by the arsonist.  ",1,11
"SCULLY: The arsonist is most likely a male, less than twenty-five years of age. He will often act out of impulse, satisfying sexual urges or insecurities with destructive behavior, which compensates for his social inadequacies or maladjustment.  ",1,11
SCULLY: Agent Beatty?  ,1,11
SCULLY: I'm Special Agent Dana Scully. Can I... steal a minute of your time?  ,1,11
SCULLY: I'm... working with Agent Mulder.  ,1,11
SCULLY: You mentioned that the arsonist might be using some kind of rocket fuel as an accelerant.  ,1,11
"SCULLY: What if he got some of this fuel into some... hand cream or, uh...  ",1,11
"SCULLY: The arsonist is usually unmarried and prone to excessive fantasies about women or men who are inaccessible to him. Often, the setting of fires results from his cowardice and inability to develop a natural relationship.  ",1,11
"SCULLY: His crimes are often very clever and elaborately planned. The suspicious nature of the fire last night strongly suggests the arsonist has followed Lord Marsden to the United States. A check of all recent immigrations in the northeastern area is underway. It has become not a matter of if, but when he will strike.  ",1,11
SCULLY: Thank you.  ,1,11
"SCULLY: It's Scully, where are you?  ",1,11
SCULLY: There's something I need to show you.  ,1,11
SCULLY: I might have some information...  ,1,11
SCULLY: Can I meet you somewhere?  ,1,11
SCULLY: There's a fire upstairs.  ,1,11
SCULLY: On the fourteenth floor.  ,1,11
SCULLY: We've got a fire on the fourteenth floor!  ,1,11
SCULLY: You were really out.  ,1,11
SCULLY: She's down the hall.  ,1,11
"SCULLY: Okay, the doctor checked them out.  ",1,11
SCULLY: It could've happened to anyone.  ,1,11
SCULLY: What do you know about this guy that saved the kids? The driver?  ,1,11
SCULLY: Who was watching the kids tonight?  ,1,11
SCULLY: Are you sure? I could have sworn I saw him down in the hallway about the same time that the fire broke out.  ,1,11
SCULLY: You all right?  ,1,11
SCULLY: You at all interested in what I came up here to show you?  ,1,11
"SCULLY: Well, I did a little checking of my own. I didn't know a whole lot about arson or arsonists so I took the opportunity... for my own edification, of course.  ",1,11
"SCULLY: And these people probably don't even tie their own shoes. There were over two-hundred names. And not a duplicate. Except one. A ""Cecil L'Ively."" He worked as a gardener for two of the victims.  ",1,11
SCULLY: Nothing.  ,1,11
"SCULLY: Apparently, he was question by Scotland Yard and they released him but I dug a little further. Cecil L'Ively is a documented citizen of Great Britain, paid his taxes, never been on the dole, a model citizen until he died in 1971 in a London tenement fire.  ",1,11
SCULLY: You're going to love this. On a list of recent visas issued by the British government. Cecil L'Ively's passport was stamped by U.S. immigration officials two weeks ago at the port of entry in Boston.  ,1,11
SCULLY: What are you going to do?  ,1,11
"SCULLY: Yes, this is Special Agent Scully. I've been waiting on hold for you guys to fax me a composite of an arson suspect. Right. Hang on a second.  ",1,11
SCULLY: It's the driver.  ,1,11
SCULLY: What's the matter?  ,1,11
SCULLY: Yes.  ,1,11
SCULLY: Michael?  ,1,11
"SCULLY: Quick, come on...  ",1,11
SCULLY: Freeze! Federal agent.  ,1,11
SCULLY: Stay right where you are.  ,1,11
SCULLY: (with English accent) Care to take me to lunch?  ,1,11
SCULLY: Where is Phoebe?  ,1,11
SCULLY: You don't know? She didn't call?  ,1,11
SCULLY: Did you play it?  ,1,11
SCULLY: Why not? Aren't you curious what's on it?  ,1,11
"SCULLY: X-File number 11214893. Addendum to the file opened by Special Agent Mulder. The arson suspect Cecil L'Ively was admitted to Boston Mercy Hospital with fifth and sixth-degree burns over his entire body. Military burn specialists have been brought in to study the case which they're calling ""extraordinary.""  ",1,11
SCULLY: ...confined to a hyperbaric chamber until he can be tried on murder charges in the death of a Massachusetts caretaker. His body temperature remains at a steady 109 degrees.  ,1,11
"SCULLY: Yup. All year. Since you always made us take the Christmas tree down the day after Christmas, I'm making up for lost time.  ",1,12
"SCULLY: That's okay, Mom, I got that.  ",1,12
"SCULLY: Thanks, Mom.  ",1,12
SCULLY: Yup. It's good.  ,1,12
"SCULLY: Well, drive carefully.  ",1,12
"SCULLY: Goodnight, Daddy.  ",1,12
SCULLY: Dad? I thought you guys left.  ,1,12
SCULLY: Mom? What's the matter?  ,1,12
"SCULLY: Last time you were that engrossed, it turned out you were reading the Adult Video News.  ",1,12
"SCULLY: ""Dana."" I'm fine, thank you. What are you working on?  ",1,12
"SCULLY: They were kept alive, tortured through that period.  ",1,12
SCULLY: That's a grim deadline.  ,1,12
SCULLY: How is he related?  ,1,12
SCULLY: Or the kidnapper.  ,1,12
SCULLY: His talents?  ,1,12
"SCULLY: Mulder, do I detect a hint of skepticism?  ",1,12
SCULLY: So you believe that Boggs is orchestrating the kidnapping from the inside. A scam to save his life?  ,1,12
SCULLY: And they've requested you speak with him?  ,1,12
SCULLY: Why you?  ,1,12
SCULLY: I'll go with you.  ,1,12
SCULLY: I need to work.  ,1,12
SCULLY: (whispering) Okay.  ,1,12
"SCULLY: As a captain, he was entitled to burial at Arlington with full ceremony.  ",1,12
SCULLY: I know that you and Dad were... disappointed that I chose the path I'm on instead of medicine but I need to know... was he at all proud of me?  ,1,12
"SCULLY: No. It's my father. I'm sorry, I'm sorry...  ",1,12
SCULLY: Did Boggs confess?  ,1,12
SCULLY: I lied to the police about how I found the warehouse. I didn't notice any suspicious activities.  ,1,12
SCULLY: It was where Boggs said it would be.  ,1,12
SCULLY: I didn't go looking for it! I came across an area that had landmarks he spoke of...  ,1,12
SCULLY: I thought it would be a better explanation under the circumstances.  ,1,12
SCULLY: I thought that you'd be pleased that I opened myself to extreme possibilities.  ,1,12
SCULLY: I love this job.  ,1,12
SCULLY: Incredible! They found them?  ,1,12
"SCULLY: I don't understand, why didn't the police notify us?  ",1,12
SCULLY: Go.  ,1,12
"SCULLY: Mulder, it's you.  ",1,12
"SCULLY: Mulder... even if he is setting us up, we have to follow because in three days...  ",1,12
"SCULLY: And then a day later, our only connection to the case will be pulling up a chair at the gas chamber.  ",1,12
SCULLY: Sweep the docks!  ,1,12
SCULLY: Mulder!  ,1,12
SCULLY: We need an ambulance... officer down!  ,1,12
SCULLY: He's reliving it. That would explain the deadline.  ,1,12
"SCULLY: You set us up. You're in on this with Lucas Henry. This was a trap for Mulder because he helped put you away. Well, I came here to tell you that if he dies because of what you've done, four days from now, no one will be able to stop me from being the one that will throw the switch and gas you out of this life for good, you son of a bitch!  ",1,12
"SCULLY: No! No, I do not believe you!  ",1,12
SCULLY: That could be a moment from any kid's life.  ,1,12
SCULLY: I'll believe you... if you let... me talk to him.  ,1,12
SCULLY: It may be a cold dark place for you but it's not for Mulder and it's not for my father.  ,1,12
SCULLY: I don't believe you.  ,1,12
SCULLY: Guard!  ,1,12
SCULLY: There's still no sign of Lucas Henry or Jim Summers. The Raliegh police said...  ,1,12
"SCULLY: Mulder, I never thought I'd say this... but what if there's another explanation?  ",1,12
"SCULLY: All right, Mr. Boggs... you got your deal.  ",1,12
"SCULLY: Alright, where are they?  ",1,12
"SCULLY: Luther, if you really were psychic...  ",1,12
"SCULLY: Federal agents, we're armed! Drop your weapon.  ",1,12
SCULLY: Go!  ,1,12
"SCULLY: I believe... that if you had orchestrated this kidnapping, Lucas Henry would have... been aware of the danger you warned me about. He never would have crossed that bridge. So you saved... Jim Summer's life. But you saved mine as well.  ",1,12
"SCULLY: I was considering Boggs. If he knew that I was your partner, he could have found out everything he knew about me. About my father...  ",1,12
"SCULLY: ""Beyond the Sea"" was playing at my parents' wedding. Visions of deceased loved ones are a common psychological phenomena. If he knew that my father had...  ",1,12
SCULLY: I'm afraid. I'm afraid to believe.  ,1,12
SCULLY: But I do know.  ,1,12
SCULLY: He was my father.  ,1,12
SCULLY: How's that?  ,1,13
SCULLY: Couldn't she just have changed clothes?  ,1,13
"SCULLY: Well, we're 30 floors up, no other means of egress. Did the medical examiner establish a cause of death?  ",1,13
SCULLY: Hard to imagine in this day and age someone having sex with a perfect stranger. Any sign of robbery?  ,1,13
"SCULLY: You know, I don't even know why we got this call in the first place.  ",1,13
"SCULLY: All young, healthy adults.  ",1,13
SCULLY: You think there's a new drug on the streets?  ,1,13
"SCULLY: The chemicals animals secrete? You mean, sexual attractants?  ",1,13
SCULLY: So you think somebody is synthesizing them?  ,1,13
"SCULLY: Well, there's still a question as to whether humans can produce pheromones. So how can that be?  ",1,13
SCULLY: He or she? You've got victims of both sexes. Both a man and a woman on the hotel security monitor.  ,1,13
"SCULLY: So what is our profile of the killer? Indeterminate height, weight, sex. Unarmed but extremely attractive.  ",1,13
SCULLY: The killer's moving south.  ,1,13
"SCULLY: Right. They live up there without electricity, phones, any modern amenities, a lot like the Amish.  ",1,13
SCULLY: What's so weird about that?  ,1,13
"SCULLY: Well, wait a minute. Aren't these people famous for their abstinence and their pure Christian ways?  ",1,13
SCULLY: We're investigating a possible murder.  ,1,13
SCULLY: Did the Kindred let you take those pictures?  ,1,13
SCULLY: (to Brother Andrew) Hi.  ,1,13
SCULLY: She must have problems on the asphalt. Has she ever thrown a shoe? (Andrew looks away) What's her name?  ,1,13
SCULLY: That's sweet. Did you name her?  ,1,13
SCULLY: That's all right. (she extends her hand) I'm Dana Scully. I don't mean you any harm.  ,1,13
SCULLY: I was just talking ...  ,1,13
"SCULLY: Yeah, I think so.  ",1,13
"SCULLY: There's something up there, Mulder.  ",1,13
SCULLY: After you.  ,1,13
SCULLY: What does the map say?  ,1,13
"SCULLY: Mulder, look.  ",1,13
SCULLY: We're FBI agents. Federal police.  ,1,13
"SCULLY: I'm going to have to ask you to remain at a distance, please, sir.  ",1,13
SCULLY: We just want to have a few questions answered.  ,1,13
SCULLY: We have pictures.  ,1,13
"SCULLY: A crime has been committed. We have certain questions that we need answered, if you'll forgive us.  ",1,13
SCULLY: Hotel security videos of a man and a woman who may have committed a murder.  ,1,13
"SCULLY: In a hotel in Washington, DC.  ",1,13
"SCULLY: And may kill again, which is why we need your help.  ",1,13
SCULLY: He can't breathe.  ,1,13
SCULLY: He's choking to death!  ,1,13
SCULLY: Take me back to the 20th century.  ,1,13
SCULLY: Believe all what?  ,1,13
"SCULLY: Well, they better take care of their own or that man at the dinner table is a dead man.  ",1,13
SCULLY: What? The choking?  ,1,13
SCULLY: Do you think they know who the murderer is?  ,1,13
"SCULLY: I know, that was odd.  ",1,13
SCULLY: These people have probably been intermarrying for years.  ,1,13
SCULLY: What are you doing?  ,1,13
SCULLY: Uh-huh.  ,1,13
SCULLY: What do you think?  ,1,13
SCULLY: The murders?  ,1,13
SCULLY: What's his name?  ,1,13
"SCULLY: What do you mean, different?  ",1,13
SCULLY: We're not sure. All of the victims died of cardiac arrest.  ,1,13
"SCULLY: Maybe, how do you know that?  ",1,13
SCULLY: Why did you keep them?  ,1,13
SCULLY: You said Marty was different.  ,1,13
SCULLY: How? How did he kill his victims?  ,1,13
SCULLY: Does it have something to do with the ceremony in the barn tonight?  ,1,13
SCULLY: What are you doing?  ,1,13
SCULLY: Oh ... oh.  ,1,13
SCULLY: (weak voice) I don't know.  ,1,13
SCULLY: No.  ,1,13
SCULLY: Thanks.  ,1,13
"SCULLY: Better ... a little embarrassed, actually.  ",1,13
SCULLY: It's like I don't remember ...  ,1,13
SCULLY: Because he told me he knew who the killer was.  ,1,13
SCULLY: I believed him.  ,1,13
SCULLY: So what did you see down in the cellar?  ,1,13
SCULLY: How do you know he was alive?  ,1,13
SCULLY: Changing sexes?  ,1,13
SCULLY: So you're saying these people ...  ,1,13
SCULLY: Think he was trying to kill me?  ,1,13
"SCULLY: Well, if he was trying to kill me, why did they let us go?  ",1,13
SCULLY: Did she touch you or make physical contact in any other manner?  ,1,13
"SCULLY: What did you see, Michael?  ",1,13
SCULLY: She was a man.  ,1,13
"SCULLY: Well, I can't rule out the possiblity that who we're looking for is a transvestite.  ",1,13
"SCULLY: I just don't want us to ignore the obvious. I mean, how else could you explain a woman overpowering a 200-pound cop? She was a he.  ",1,13
SCULLY: This is Agent Scully requesting police backup and additional agents at 771 Catherine Street. It's the Hotel Catherine.  ,1,13
SCULLY: Mulder!  ,1,13
SCULLY: Dead body!  ,1,13
"SCULLY: (from the floor, weakly) I'm OK.  ",1,13
"SCULLY: Federal agent, I'm armed! (Marty stops) Back away!  ",1,13
SCULLY: Step away! Step away!  ,1,13
SCULLY: No. Step away. (Andrew continues to approach her) I'm armed.  ,1,13
SCULLY: They're gone.  ,1,13
SCULLY: I don't understand. How can they just disappear? They have no means of transportation.  ,1,13
"SCULLY: (quietly, to WILLIS) Relax, theyll be here.  ",1,14
SCULLY: Sure it wasnt a bogus tip?  ,1,14
SCULLY: (warning tease) Just as long as you keep yours.  ,1,14
"SCULLY: Come on, Jack.  ",1,14
SCULLY: No. You cant give up on him.  ,1,14
SCULLY: Go up to 400.  ,1,14
"SCULLY: Im a doctor. Go up to 400, or Ill do it myself.  ",1,14
SCULLY: Give him another amp of EPI intracardial and go up to 400 again. (They stare at her.) Do it.  ,1,14
"SCULLY: Again. Come on, Jack.  ",1,14
SCULLY: Any word from Willis?  ,1,14
SCULLY: Yeah. Three fingers on Dupre's left hand were severed by surgical shears. We lifted prints. They're Willis.  ,1,14
"SCULLY: Yeah, he lived the case. It was all he thought about, talked about.  ",1,14
SCULLY: That maybe this is some kind of post-trauma psychosis. Like the way soldiers sometimes mutilate the body of a dead enemy.  ,1,14
SCULLY: They met while she was serving a ten year sentence for manslaughter at the Women's Correctional Facility of Maryland.  ,1,14
SCULLY: Until the warden found out about their secret. According to Lula's cell mate they carried on quite a torrid romance.  ,1,14
SCULLY: One week before the first robbery at Annapolis Savings and Loan. The 65-year-old female teller was pistol-whipped. Died from a massive subdural hemorrhage all because she didnt put the money in the bag fast enough.  ,1,14
"SCULLY: Well, apparently they took turns --- one pulling a job while the other one drove getaway. Between the two of them, theyve killed seven people and gotten away with close to $100,000.  ",1,14
"SCULLY: Well, were putting her face out there --- local newspapers, Americas Most Wanted. (notices Mulder not paying attention, still reading the file) Am I boring you?  ",1,14
SCULLY: Yeah. Last May in Atlantic City. So what?  ,1,14
SCULLY: It's a left thumbprint.  ,1,14
"SCULLY: What do you mean, ""whoever""? It was Willis.  ",1,14
SCULLY: I'm not sure where you're going.  ,1,14
SCULLY: Just over 13 minutes.  ,1,14
"SCULLY: It could be anything  an instrument malfunction, electrical overload.  ",1,14
SCULLY: (pause) Two heartbeats.  ,1,14
SCULLY: Right.  ,1,14
"SCULLY: Technically, but we resuscitated Willis.  ",1,14
SCULLY: (warning) Mulder.  ,1,14
"SCULLY: The usual stuff  the tunnel, the light, people rising up and viewing their own bodies.  ",1,14
"SCULLY: Some sort of disassociative, hallucinatory activity.  ",1,14
SCULLY: Changed how?  ,1,14
SCULLY: I dont understand.  ,1,14
SCULLY: What happened?  ,1,14
SCULLY: (sighs)  ,1,14
SCULLY: I dont discount the near-death experience because it can be explained empirically by stimulation of the temporal lobe.  ,1,14
"SCULLY: Its my still best guess Jacks disappearance can be explained in psychological, not supernatural, terms.  ",1,14
"SCULLY: The stress of the case, the trauma of being shot.. Jacks personality.  ",1,14
SCULLY: (forced casual) We dated  for almost a year. He was my instructor at the academy.  ,1,14
"SCULLY: (walking back toward MULDER, remembering fondly) We even had the same birthday. We used to celebrate in some dive in Statford that had a slanting pool table. But it was always so hard for Jack to relax. It was impossible for him really. He was always so intense, so relentlessly determined.  ",1,14
"SCULLY: I believe its a long way from saying Jack had a near-death experience to saying his bodys been inhabited by Warren Dupre. (walks down the hall, looks back over her shoulder) A long way.  ",1,14
SCULLY: Thats Lulas brother.  ,1,14
SCULLY: Whats his story?  ,1,14
SCULLY: Excuse me. (goes to door) Jack  ,1,14
SCULLY: (to OFFICER DANIELS) Is there a problem here?  ,1,14
"SCULLY: Its all right, Officer. This is Agent Jack Willis. Hes with the Violent Crimes Section of the Washington Bureau. (quietly leading WILLIS through the door) Come on. Lets talk out here.  ",1,14
"SCULLY: (quietly to WILLIS) For Gods sake, Willis, what happened? Half the Bureaus been looking for you. Where have you been?  ",1,14
SCULLY: Im taking you back to the hospital. Youre in no shape to be ---  ,1,14
SCULLY: Youre not ready to be here.  ,1,14
SCULLY: Jack. Youre recovering from a major trauma. Its a miracle youre even able to walk around.  ,1,14
SCULLY: Jack   ,1,14
SCULLY: As a matter of fact he was.  ,1,14
SCULLY: (reluctantly giving in) You did open the book on this one.  ,1,14
SCULLY: All right. But as a colleague and as a friend Im recommending you undergo a full medical evaluation --- physical and psychological.  ,1,14
SCULLY: (confused) Youre two months early.  ,1,14
SCULLY: We do.  ,1,14
SCULLY: You mean you tested him.  ,1,14
SCULLY: What evidence?  ,1,14
SCULLY: (crossing to MULDER) And you think Willis is responsible?  ,1,14
"SCULLY: Cant you accept the possibility that this isnt an X-File? Aside from the expected level of post-trauma stress, Jack passed both of his evaluations --- physical and psychological. (defensively) Anyway, just because someone forgets a birthday doesnt mean that hes been possessed. When I was studying for my medical boards, I forgot my birthday too.  ",1,14
"SCULLY: Like I said, Mulder, stress, all right? We both know it can significantly affect someones cursive standard. Im afraid this doesnt prove a thing.  ",1,14
SCULLY: Jack. Where are you going?  ,1,14
SCULLY: Hotline?  ,1,14
"SCULLY: Jack, can I ask you something?  ",1,14
SCULLY: (difficult to ask) The Phillips murder. The print Mulder lifted off the television --- its missing.  ,1,14
SCULLY: And  you were carrying the evidence back.  ,1,14
SCULLY: Number 202.  ,1,14
SCULLY: Multrevich.  ,1,14
SCULLY: Wheres 207?  ,1,14
"SCULLY: All right, Mr. Multrevich, we want you to go back inside your apartment and stay away from the windows.  ",1,14
"SCULLY: Wheres our back up? You said you called them, right?  ",1,14
SCULLY: Im going to call in again.  ,1,14
SCULLY: Ill check back here.  ,1,14
SCULLY: Face down! Face down! Hands behind your back. Now!  ,1,14
"SCULLY: Shes all yours, Jack.  ",1,14
SCULLY: (warily) I already cuffed her.  ,1,14
"SCULLY: Whats going on, Jack?  ",1,14
SCULLY: Jack   ,1,14
SCULLY: (into phone) Mulder?  ,1,14
SCULLY: (into phone) Dont --- (WILLIS pulls the phone away)  ,1,14
"SCULLY: Its not going to work, Jack.  ",1,14
"SCULLY: Bureau policy prohibits negotiating with kidnappers. But you already know that, dont you, Jack?  ",1,14
"SCULLY: Your name is Jack Willis. You were born February 23, 1957. You live at 51 Stanhope ---  ",1,14
"SCULLY: We spent a weekend up at Pine Barrens. You taught me how to fish through the ice. It was your parents cabin. Jack, try to remember. We drove up in a snowstorm. Come on, Jack.  ",1,14
SCULLY: What did you see?  ,1,14
SCULLY: You *are* my friend.  ,1,14
SCULLY: No. We brought you back.  ,1,14
"SCULLY: No. You wont kill me, Jack.  ",1,14
SCULLY: (realization) Soda. How much of that have you had?  ,1,14
SCULLY: Jack Willis is diabetic. Which means youre diabetic. Too much sugar in the system could lead to hyperglycemia.  ,1,14
SCULLY: Abdominal pain is the first sign of impending diabetic coma. You need insulin.  ,1,14
SCULLY: Hold on.  ,1,14
"SCULLY: Without this medicine, he dies.  ",1,14
SCULLY: (waking) Hmn? Huh?  ,1,14
"SCULLY: Yes, Jack. There was lots of snow.  ",1,14
SCULLY: It was December. It was the weekend after Thanksgiving.  ,1,14
SCULLY: (encouraging him) Yeah. Thats right. There was a wood-burning stove right in the middle of the room.  ,1,14
SCULLY: Yeah.  ,1,14
SCULLY: (fondly) Yeah.  ,1,14
"SCULLY: No! Jack, dont close your eyes. Come on, keep talking. Jack, keep talking. Come on.  ",1,14
SCULLY: No. No.  ,1,14
SCULLY: Hes dead. Its all on you now. Hes dead because of you.  ,1,14
SCULLY: Jack!  ,1,14
"SCULLY: Jack, put the gun down.  ",1,14
SCULLY: No!  ,1,14
SCULLY: Jack!  ,1,14
SCULLY: (not looking at MULDER) Jack!?  ,1,14
"SCULLY: ""Happy 35th, Love D."" I got it for him three years ago.  ",1,14
SCULLY: Uh .. no. Jack was an only child. Both his parents died when he was in college. Theres a kid over in Parklawn. Jacks been his Big Brother so Im going to go and see him tomorrow. What am I going to tell him?  ,1,14
SCULLY: Which is?  ,1,14
"SCULLY: (sighs, looks away and sits) What am I supposed to tell myself?  ",1,14
SCULLY: (looks at watch) Its not working. It stopped. At 6:47.  ,1,14
SCULLY: What does that mean?  ,1,14
SCULLY: I still don't get it. What does this have to do with us?  ,1,15
SCULLY: Thank you.  ,1,15
SCULLY: What happened here?  ,1,15
SCULLY: What is it?  ,1,15
SCULLY: Who's Barnett?  ,1,15
SCULLY: What was the theory?  ,1,15
SCULLY: Sort of?  ,1,15
"SCULLY: ""Fox can't guard the chicken coop.""  ",1,15
SCULLY: So you never caught him?  ,1,15
SCULLY: And what happened to Barnett?  ,1,15
SCULLY: So you think he escaped?  ,1,15
SCULLY: You're sure?  ,1,15
SCULLY: Where's Mulder?  ,1,15
SCULLY: He's got a clear shot.  ,1,15
SCULLY: But he couldn't.  ,1,15
SCULLY: Because it's not by the book.  ,1,15
"SCULLY: So, Mulder did shoot Barnett.  ",1,15
SCULLY: Probably had a lot to do with the sentence the judge gave Barnett.  ,1,15
SCULLY: What did Henderson come up with?  ,1,15
SCULLY: What's that?  ,1,15
SCULLY: Then it must be a very clever copycat.  ,1,15
SCULLY: Pull any prints?  ,1,15
"SCULLY: Barnett had a lot of time on his hands while he was in prison, maybe he planned it with someone on the outside.  ",1,15
"SCULLY: He planned to get you, didn't he?  ",1,15
"SCULLY: You did the right thing, Mulder.  ",1,15
SCULLY: Sorry. This was just faxed.  ,1,15
SCULLY: I just got off the phone with the prison.  ,1,15
"SCULLY: No, I called them on a hunch. John Barnett died of a heart attack, right? At least that's what it says on his death certificate. Well, I had them fax me all of his medical records. Barnett was admitted to the prison infirmary for an infection in his right hand. There isn't any indication or diagnosis of coronary complications. In fact, on his physical six months earlier, he was given a clean bill of health.  ",1,15
SCULLY: He left you everything he had in his will. You must've known him better than pretty well.  ,1,15
SCULLY: On his death certificate.  ,1,15
SCULLY: What doctor?  ,1,15
SCULLY: How could you tell Barnett wasn't dead?  ,1,15
SCULLY: What are you going to do?  ,1,15
SCULLY: You mean the ghost of John Barnett.  ,1,15
"SCULLY: Hello? Yeah, just a minute.  ",1,15
"SCULLY: All right, all right...  ",1,15
SCULLY: You lost him.  ,1,15
SCULLY: Was it Barnett?  ,1,15
SCULLY: What did he mean by that?  ,1,15
"SCULLY: I hope you guys brought your fine-toothed comb. I want every piece of lint collected and analyzed. If nothing turns up, run it through it again.  ",1,15
SCULLY: I'm sorry.  ,1,15
SCULLY: Mulder... we're still not a hundred percent sure that this is him.  ,1,15
"SCULLY: I was just trying to find you. Listen to this. According to the A.M.A., Doctor Ridley, who signed Barnett's death certificate, hasn't officially been a doctor since 1979.  ",1,15
SCULLY: His membership expired and wasn't renowed after the state of Maryland revoked his medical license for flagrant research malpractice and misuse of a government grant.  ,1,15
SCULLY: Right here. In the federal journal for the National Institute of Health.  ,1,15
SCULLY: He was conducting experiments on young children afflicted with a disease called progeria.  ,1,15
SCULLY: But fatal.  ,1,15
"SCULLY: So, how did Doctor Ridley eventually lose his medical license?  ",1,15
"SCULLY: I'm afraid your colleague, Doctor Ridley, has dropped off the face of the earth.  ",1,15
SCULLY: You just don't reverse aging.  ,1,15
SCULLY: Listen to what you're saying.  ,1,15
"SCULLY: Mulder, it's science fiction.  ",1,15
"SCULLY: Ridley's notes from the human trials at N.I.H. indicate he didn't see aging as inevitable but as an opportunistic disease. A disease that could be prevented, reversed even, by changing the chemical cues that trigger certain genes. However, there is no evidence whatsoever that Ridley's work yielded any results or that his theories, all hope to the contrary, hold any validity.  ",1,15
SCULLY: Who is it?  ,1,15
SCULLY: The same disease that kills the kids suffering from progeria?  ,1,15
SCULLY: But how?  ,1,15
SCULLY: The material that insulates neurons in the body.  ,1,15
"SCULLY: I, I'm afraid to ask. What kind of hand did you grow?  ",1,15
SCULLY: Unbelievable.  ,1,15
SCULLY: Because you knew that if your theories panned out...  ,1,15
SCULLY ON MACHINE: Hi. This is Dana Scully. Please leave a message after the tone.  ,1,15
SCULLY: It's my private answering machine. Or at least it used to be.  ,1,15
"SCULLY: When I ran from the shower this morning, I heard someone dialing in my private code and replaying my messages. Last night, before Doctor Ridley, I could have sworn that someone was in my apartment. But when Ridley knocked, I thought I'd mistaken the noise for him.  ",1,15
"SCULLY: This morning, I took this down to prints before I came here. John Barnett's left index oblique is on the underside of this unit.  ",1,15
"SCULLY: Uh, that my mother called for no reason and I'm meeting a friend before her cello recital.  ",1,15
SCULLY: I'm including a diagram of the theater. You have six front entrances and four more backstage.  ,1,15
SCULLY: It's the first time I've ever played the target.  ,1,15
SCULLY: Gun!  ,1,15
SCULLY: Like somebody kicked me in the ribs.  ,1,15
SCULLY: What about him?  ,1,15
SCULLY: Is Barnett conscious?  ,1,15
"SCULLY: Mulder, I know what you did wasn't by the book.  ",1,15
SCULLY: They lost him.  ,1,15
SCULLY: Where do you think it is?  ,1,15
"SCULLY: If it didn't destroy it, chances are that somehow, someday, somebody will find it.  ",1,15
"SCULLY: From the truckers description, the shape he fired on could conceivably have been a mountain lion.  ",1,16
SCULLY: The National Weather Service last night reported atmospheric conditions in this area that were possibly conducive to lightning.  ,1,16
"SCULLY: It is feasible that the truck was struck by lightning, creating the electrical failure.  ",1,16
"SCULLY: And you know, theres a marsh over there. The lights the driver saw may have been swamp gas.  ",1,16
"SCULLY: Its a natural phenonemon in which phospine and methane rising from decaying organic matter ignite, creating globes of blue flame.  ",1,16
"SCULLY: Mulder, none of that evidence is conclusive.  ",1,16
"SCULLY: Isnt it more plausible that an exhausted truck driver became swept up in the hysteria and fired at hallucinations? I mean, after all, the road can play tricks on you.  ",1,16
"SCULLY: Pardon me for asking, but how long have you had that cough?  ",1,16
"SCULLY: Im just concerned, you said you were a veteran.  ",1,16
"SCULLY: The cough, the fever, the rash. Those are all symptoms of Gulf War Syndrome.  ",1,16
SCULLY: Why?  ,1,16
SCULLY: Ranheim was sick.  ,1,16
SCULLY: Mm-hmm.  ,1,16
"SCULLY: Mulder, the only UFOs people are likely to see are secret military aircraft.  ",1,16
"SCULLY: Well, there is a base in Little Rock. You think thats what the Air Force was flying that night?  ",1,16
SCULLY: Possibly.  ,1,16
"SCULLY: Mulder, the military isnt going to talk about classified aircraft.  ",1,16
SCULLY: Hmm.  ,1,16
SCULLY: I think you give the government too much credit.  ,1,16
SCULLY: what makes you think they could plan and execute such an elaborate conspiracy?  ,1,16
SCULLY: How can they do that?  ,1,16
SCULLY: Hmmm Ill check.  ,1,16
SCULLY: Hey!  ,1,16
SCULLY: This strip is an anti-counterfeiting measure.  ,1,16
SCULLY: Those were the most paranoid people I have ever met. I dont know how you could think that what they say is even remotely plausible.  ,1,16
SCULLY: Did you see the way they answered the telephone? They probably think that every call that they get is monitored and theyre followed wherever they go. Its a form of self-delusion. It makes them think that what theyre doing is important enough that somebody would  ,1,16
"SCULLY: The truck is bogus. And sos the truck driver, Ranheim. First I checked his manifest. It listed a truck carrying 180 cartons of auto parts weighing 3,100 pounds. Then I checked with three weigh stations along his route and they have it listed at 5,100 pounds. Theres something in that truck, Mulder, and its not auto parts. And of course, nobody ever reported him. Furthermore, Ranheim lied about being in the Gulf War. His real name is Frank Druce  and I worked hard to get this one. He was Special Operations Black Beret in Mosul, northern Iraq. Also, he didnt get sick from the encounter the other night. Hes been to the V.A. hospital for treatment three times this past year.  ",1,16
SCULLY: Where did you obtain this information?  ,1,16
SCULLY: I want to know all about him.  ,1,16
SCULLY: How do you know that? We work for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and were being bugged. What does that tell you?  ,1,16
"SCULLY: Exactly. And for all we know, this deep background is the one responsible for the bug.  ",1,16
"SCULLY: Mulder, youre the only one I trust.  ",1,16
SCULLY: Generally. Its heading west. Towards Colorado.  ,1,16
"SCULLY: Mulder, this photograph is a fake.  ",1,16
SCULLY: Look.  ,1,16
SCULLY: Now look closely at the color of the light reflected in the windshield. Now that reflection should be from the red lights in the UFO but it doesnt match the color of the ships light.  ,1,16
SCULLY: We should have it analyzed.  ,1,16
"SCULLY: Well, maybe youre too determined to believe him.  ",1,16
"SCULLY: Mulder, listen to me.  ",1,16
"SCULLY: Please, will you just hear me?  ",1,16
SCULLY: Mulder? Are you home?  ,1,16
SCULLY: Mul  ,1,16
"SCULLY: I think this time youre right, Mulder.  ",1,16
"SCULLY: Id also like a one-way ticket to Los Angeles with a stop at Las Vegas, and Ill be paying cash.  ",1,16
SCULLY: My ears numb from being on hold for so many hours.  ,1,16
SCULLY: Yep. Its heading northwest on I-90.  ,1,16
SCULLY: Here we go.  ,1,16
SCULLY: Yeah.  ,1,16
SCULLY: Ranheim? Ranheim?  ,1,16
SCULLY: Oh my God.  ,1,16
SCULLY: Whered it go?  ,1,16
"SCULLY: God, Mulder, I cant stop shaking. What we just saw  did it fit the profile?  ",1,16
SCULLY: But how could anyone generate such force?  ,1,16
"SCULLY: So they created this elaborate show just to deflect us again. I mean, wouldnt it have been easier just for them to   ",1,16
SCULLY: Now we have nothing to go on. No one to turn to.  ,1,16
SCULLY: The sightings are following the path of the truck.  ,1,16
SCULLY: Aliens?  ,1,16
SCULLY: Weve driven full circle through Mattawa twice. Theres nothing here.  ,1,16
SCULLY: Whats going on here?  ,1,16
SCULLY: This place has got to have the highest level of security.  ,1,16
SCULLY: Who?  ,1,16
SCULLY: 5-3-1-1.  ,1,16
SCULLY: Were gonna look suspicious going back.  ,1,16
"SCULLY: Mulder, theyre not going to let us.  ",1,16
"SCULLY: Mulder, stop. Were agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  ",1,16
"SCULLY: Mulder, no!  ",1,16
"SCULLY: The woman on the table has a malignant tumor on her spine. This boy, here, is going to attempt to heal her by simply laying his hands on her.  ",1,17
SCULLY: It came in from the regional office in Tennessee. The preacher's name is ...  ,1,17
SCULLY: You've heard of him?  ,1,17
SCULLY: Did you know that he also claims the boy brought a man back from the dead?  ,1,17
"SCULLY: Well, not according to the Kenwood Country sheriff. Local authorities think that Reverend Hartley and his son are a scam. They've been trying to shut him down for some time now, but without any luck, so they've turned to the FBI to try and get a prosecution.  ",1,17
"SCULLY: No, murder. Watch the tape.  ",1,17
SCULLY: Twenty minutes later Lucy Kelly was rushed to the hospital. She was pronounced dead on arrival.  ,1,17
"SCULLY: I don't know, but it wasn't cancer. They've requested someone with a medical background to assist local police in the investigation. I know this isn't an X-File ...  ",1,17
"SCULLY: (smiling) Mulder, you weren't at Woodstock.  ",1,17
SCULLY: Maybe we should head backstage and see what the Reverend has to say.  ,1,17
SCULLY: (flashing her badge) Reverend Hartley? We're with the FBI.  ,1,17
"SCULLY: We just want to talk to Samuel for a couple of minutes, that's all.  ",1,17
SCULLY: Right. Thank you.  ,1,17
"SCULLY: Well, there's nothing out of the ordinary about these reports, except that there were no autopsies performed.  ",1,17
"SCULLY: Well, maybe we can arrange to have the bodies exhumed.  ",1,17
"SCULLY: We don't mean you any disrespect. We're investigating a possible homicide, and federal law requires that we do a post-mortem examination on these bodies.  ",1,17
"SCULLY: We can't do much here, anyway.  ",1,17
SCULLY: Some might call it a plain old bar brawl.  ,1,17
SCULLY: The trouble of what?  ,1,17
SCULLY: So you're saying that you killed those people with a touch?  ,1,17
"SCULLY: Did he buy you all that jewelry, too? I think there's something missing in your story, Samuel.  ",1,17
SCULLY: No. But I doubt the veracity of your claims.  ,1,17
SCULLY: Is this some kind of a trick?  ,1,17
SCULLY: (standing up) I think we should get the sheriff ...  ,1,17
SCULLY: Sheriff?  ,1,17
SCULLY: How do you think he does it?  ,1,17
"SCULLY: Why, Mulder?  ",1,17
"SCULLY: A few thousand grasshoppers does not constitute a plague. Besides which, we're in farm country. This area is an agricultural smorgasbord for this type of infestation.  ",1,17
"SCULLY: So what's next? The slaying of the firstborn? (Mulder chuckles) Mulder, does this have something to do with what Samuel said in the bar last night - about your sister?  ",1,17
"SCULLY: ""Spontaneous remission of metastatic cancer ... regenerated nerve growth after post-trauma paraplegia ...""  ",1,17
"SCULLY: Mulder, I admit this is intriguing, but there's a whole library of medical literature dealing with unexplained spontaneous cures.  ",1,17
SCULLY: Um-hmm.  ,1,17
"SCULLY: So your theory is that if Samuel can repair this energy field in order to heal, he can also destroy it in order to kill.  ",1,17
"SCULLY: OK, say that Samuel's touch can kill. Why would he want to?  ",1,17
SCULLY: You mean Sheriff Daniels?  ,1,17
"SCULLY: Well, he seems to think that your ministry is a fraud.  ",1,17
"SCULLY: In light of recent events, you can't blame him.  ",1,17
"SCULLY: I think so. Mulder, what do you think?  ",1,17
SCULLY: Mulder. What is it?  ,1,17
SCULLY: Who? Jessica Hahn?  ,1,17
SCULLY: Apparently miracles don't come cheap.  ,1,17
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,1,17
SCULLY: I'm a doctor.  ,1,17
SCULLY: Somebody get an ambulance!  ,1,17
SCULLY: (to Mulder) She's dead.  ,1,17
"SCULLY: We know the Reverend Hartley's been pressuring you, but this is the third death linked with the Miracle Ministry.  ",1,17
"SCULLY: What illness did your daughter suffer from, Mr. Hohman?  ",1,17
SCULLY: And has she ever had a siezure before this?  ,1,17
"SCULLY: You see, I think that the siezure she had is indicative of some kind of embolism or aneurysm.  ",1,17
SCULLY: And are you going to be content to bury her without knowing the true cause of death? Without knowing if there was foul play involved?  ,1,17
SCULLY: No.  ,1,17
"SCULLY: I was raised a Catholic, and I have a certain familiarity with the scripture. And God never lets the Devil steal the show.  ",1,17
SCULLY: (nodding and smiling) One of my favorite movies.  ,1,17
SCULLY: So who were you pursuing in the crowd tonight?  ,1,17
"SCULLY: That boy really has you going, doesn't he?  ",1,17
"SCULLY: In the bar, Samuel mentioned your sister. Is it your sister you keep thinking you're seeing?  ",1,17
SCULLY: Maybe you just want to see her.  ,1,17
"SCULLY: Mulder, don't discount the power of suggestion. A healer's greatest magic lies in the patient's willingness to believe. Imagine a miracle and you're halfway there. We learned that in med school.  ",1,17
"SCULLY: (Into microphone) 11:21 pm, March 7. Subject's name is Margaret Hohman, female, caucasian, 107 pounds.  ",1,17
"SCULLY: Mulder, take a look at this.  ",1,17
SCULLY: (with a lung in her hands) Lesions on the lungs here. I'm finding them throughout the cardiovascular and pulmonary systems. There's also a lot of damage to the mucous membranes. I think that she must have died from cellular hypoxia - a lack of oxygen to the cells.  ,1,17
"SCULLY: My guess? Ingestion or injection of sodium or potassium cyanide, maybe arsenic. I won't know exactly until I run a toxicology screen on her.  ",1,17
SCULLY: Labs won't be open 'til morning.  ,1,17
SCULLY: He was alone in his cell when Mulder left him this morning. How could this have happened?  ,1,17
SCULLY: Reverend Hartley. We're sorry for your loss.  ,1,17
"SCULLY: You've got that look on your face, Mulder.  ",1,17
SCULLY: The kind when you've forgotten your keys and you're trying to figure out how to get back in the house.  ,1,17
SCULLY: What exactly are we trying to find?  ,1,17
SCULLY: Oh.  ,1,17
SCULLY: What does it mean?  ,1,17
"SCULLY: Well, where did they all come from?  ",1,17
SCULLY: And you think whoever did this is responsible for the murders.  ,1,17
"SCULLY: I'm afraid not, Reverend. We've traced a pesticide order to him from a chemical company in Knoxville. Cyanogen bromide - it's a cyanide derivative.  ",1,17
SCULLY: Cyanide - there's no way to tell how much he's ingested.  ,1,17
"SCULLY: It's too late, we have to get him to the hospital ourselves.  ",1,17
"SCULLY: (voiceover) Rather than simply killing Samuel, Vance contrived to kill the ministry's faith in him. We have conclusive evidence connecting him both to the courtroom infestation and to the poisoning deaths of three members of the ministry. Vance's obsession outlived Samuel, however. His conscience haunted him until he became delusory and finally took his own life, effectively ending our investigation. In light of this information, it is highly doubtful that there have ever been any miracles in Kenwood, Tennessee.  ",1,17
SCULLY: Sundays will probably never be the same again in these parts.  ,1,17
SCULLY: Even without his son?  ,1,17
"SCULLY: Yeah, and I have a story about a plague of locusts. I just hope Reverend Hartley didn't arrange this body snatching as his miracle of miracles.  ",1,17
SCULLY: What exactly do you think?  ,1,17
"SCULLY: You coming, Mulder?  ",1,17
SCULLY: So we can't talk about Mr. Parkers federal court case against the Trego indian reservation?  ,1,18
"SCULLY: Well, Joseph Goodensnake is dead with a wound from your shotgun to indicate otherwise.  ",1,18
SCULLY: The creeps?  ,1,18
"SCULLY: The victim was shot there, about three meters from where Parker fired. There's no way he could have mistaken a person for an animal. It's open-and-shut, Mulder. You know, I'm surprised you volunteered for this assignment. Any Bureau agent could have investigated this reservation homicide. Why are you interested?  ",1,18
"SCULLY: Well, there seems to be nothing unexplainable about this case.  ",1,18
"SCULLY: Mulder, this is so odd. It's almost like a snakeskin that's been shed. I suspect that the Parkers knowingly killed Joe Goodensnake, but they hardly seem the type to skin their victim.  ",1,18
"SCULLY: Well, we're going to have to take a look at the body ourselves.  ",1,18
SCULLY: We're looking for any individuals who might be able to provide information on the homicide of Joe Goodensnake ...  ,1,18
SCULLY: Sheriff Tskany? (she extends her hand but the sheriff does not extend his) I'm Agent Scully and this is Agent Mulder.  ,1,18
SCULLY: Take a look at that scar tissue.  ,1,18
SCULLY: Looks like he'd been attacked by an animal as well.  ,1,18
SCULLY: No. Those wounds have been healing for quite some time. The shotgun wound indicates point-blank range. The pellets entered the body in a single mass. The assailant couldn't have been more than three feet away.  ,1,18
"SCULLY: Well, could his records have been switched or misplaced?  ",1,18
"SCULLY: Well, there are cases of calcium phosphate salts developing abnormally with age, but ...  ",1,18
"SCULLY: So Parker saw what he wanted to see, an animal.  ",1,18
SCULLY: I'm fully qualified.  ,1,18
SCULLY: But you're a law enforcement officer. You can't destroy evidence.  ,1,18
"SCULLY: Mulder, since we've been here, you've acted as if you've expected to find every piece of evidence that we've come across. What aren't you telling me? Why are we here?  ",1,18
SCULLY: Sounds like the Parker scenario.  ,1,18
SCULLY: This file indicates that they started again in 1954.  ,1,18
SCULLY: Here it comes.  ,1,18
"SCULLY: Mulder, what this, what this folder describes is called lycanthropy. (Mulder bites his lip and looks away) It's a type of insanity in which an individual believes that he can turn into a wolf. I mean, no one can physically change into an animal.  ",1,18
"SCULLY: Mulder, even if you're right and Joe Goodensnake did somehow have the ability to transform physically into an animal, he's dead. Jim Parker shot him and in a couple of moments, his body will be burned. End of mystery.  ",1,18
SCULLY: Gwen ...  ,1,18
SCULLY: I just wanted to say that I'm sorry about your brother. I feel sad for anyone who loses a part of their family.  ,1,18
"SCULLY: Gwen, I don't know what to say. I'm ...  ",1,18
"SCULLY: By the way the body's been mutilated, I'd say he's been attacked by a large predator, or someone wanted it to look that way. Do you think this is retaliation for the death of Joe Goodensnake?  ",1,18
SCULLY: Have you talked to Gwen Goodensnake? She seemed pretty upset last night.  ,1,18
SCULLY: And what about Lyle Parker?  ,1,18
SCULLY: He could be dead as well. I'll take a look around.  ,1,18
"SCULLY: Mulder! Mulder, I'm taking Lyle to the hospital. He's suffering from exposure, and when he's been checked out, I'm gonna question him.  ",1,18
"SCULLY: When you did go home, did you talk to your father?  ",1,18
"SCULLY: Your father's dead. I'm sorry. (Lyle closes his eyes) It appears as if he's been attacked by an animal, but I suspect it may be homicide. Lyle, I lost my father recently and I know how overwhelming ...  ",1,18
SCULLY: I don't know.  ,1,18
SCULLY: Power's out.  ,1,18
SCULLY: You OK?  ,1,18
"SCULLY: Lyle? Let me come in. Lyle, I want to take you back to the hospital, OK?  ",1,18
"SCULLY: Lyle? Lyle, answer me. Lyle, are you all right?  ",1,18
"SCULLY: (coming out of the shadows) It's OK, it's me. It's me. I don't know what happened. Something jumped me downstairs and I lost my gun.  ",1,18
SCULLY: (breathless) OK.  ,1,18
"SCULLY: Oh my God! (Lyle lies dead in the corner) He was in the bathroom, sick, and then the next thing I knew we were attacked by the mountain lion.  ",1,18
SCULLY: Maybe.  ,1,18
SCULLY: What am I looking at?  ,1,19
"SCULLY: Right, but what am I looking for?  ",1,19
"SCULLY: I dont know, I... I give up, Mulder.  ",1,19
"SCULLY: Why, what happened to them?  ",1,19
SCULLY: Ecoterrorists or militant environmentalists.  ,1,19
SCULLY: Do they know why?  ,1,19
SCULLY: It appears as if these monkey wrenchers are doing more than just a little mischief-making.  ,1,19
SCULLY: For an ecoterrorism case? Do I dare ask why?  ,1,19
SCULLY: And you suspect what? Bigfoot?  ,1,19
"SCULLY: Must be pretty rugged where were going, huh?  ",1,19
"SCULLY: ""Freddies?""  ",1,19
SCULLY: Do you think theyd go so far as to kill a man?  ,1,19
SCULLY: Get the impression that weve walked into the middle of a war thats already started?  ,1,19
"SCULLY: Youre kidding, right?  ",1,19
SCULLY: So how are we going to get up to the camp?  ,1,19
SCULLY: Looks like they left in a hurry too.  ,1,19
SCULLY: Somebody really turned this place upside-down.  ,1,19
"SCULLY: Well, you were right about one thing.  ",1,19
SCULLY: It definitely wasnt Bigfoot.  ,1,19
SCULLY: What is it?  ,1,19
SCULLY: Got it.  ,1,19
"SCULLY: Yeah, I think so.  ",1,19
SCULLY: Oh God...  ,1,19
"SCULLY: No, more like all the fluids have been bled from this body. Almost like its been cured.  ",1,19
SCULLY: What kind of an insect could have gotten a man all the way up into that tree?  ,1,19
SCULLY: When who comes?  ,1,19
SCULLY: We found something in the forest.  ,1,19
SCULLY: Thats the man you said that was devoured alive?  ,1,19
SCULLY: (to Mulder) What do you think?  ,1,19
SCULLY: Who marks these trees?  ,1,19
SCULLY: You must get a lot of lumber from a big tree like this.  ,1,19
"SCULLY: Those center rings are the older rings, right?  ",1,19
"SCULLY: Thats what were trying to determine, sir.  ",1,19
SCULLY: Why not?  ,1,19
SCULLY: Can you identify them?  ,1,19
"SCULLY: Well, they appear to be hatching out of the porous wood. Maybe when you drew out this core, you tapped into a larger nest.  ",1,19
SCULLY: You think these mites are what killed the men?  ,1,19
SCULLY: These bugs arent moving anymore. Theyre either dead or theyre asleep.  ,1,19
"SCULLY: Thats weird, I mean, usually bugs are attracted to light.  ",1,19
"SCULLY: Uh, just what I learned in my biology courses. That theyre the foundation of our ecosystem. That theres lots of them, something like 200 million per person on this planet.  ",1,19
"SCULLY: Yeah, something like 600 million years, even before the dinosaurs. Why?  ",1,19
"SCULLY: Well, like what, exactly?  ",1,19
"SCULLY: Yeah, but how does that explain the bugs?  ",1,19
"SCULLY: Oh, a brain-sucking amoeba.  ",1,19
SCULLY: But an amoeba is a single-celled organism. It can be mutated. An insect is a complex animal. It would take years and years to evolve.  ,1,19
SCULLY: Its working?  ,1,19
"SCULLY: What about transmissions, could we send a message?  ",1,19
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,1,19
SCULLY: What about the gas in the trucks?  ,1,19
"SCULLY: Well, then weve got to get back on the radio, weve got to send out a mayday.  ",1,19
SCULLY: Mulder...  ,1,19
SCULLY: Fine. What do you suggest?  ,1,19
"SCULLY: Look, I think we both have a pretty good idea of what happened to those loggers and what happened to the group in 1934.  ",1,19
SCULLY: Its a big forest.  ,1,19
"SCULLY: You mean, would I have made a decision by myself that would have affected the whole group?  ",1,19
"SCULLY: Well, what do you want me to say? Lets face it, Mulder, we might die up here! If were lucky, theyll find our bodies spun up in a tree or they may not find us at all!  ",1,19
SCULLY: What are you going to do?  ,1,19
"SCULLY: I can see them. You guys, look at this.  ",1,19
SCULLY: Get them off me!  ,1,19
"SCULLY: Can you see them? Mulder, get them off me!  ",1,19
SCULLY: I thought we were supposed to be safe in the light!  ,1,19
SCULLY: Im okay.  ,1,19
SCULLY: And then what? Its over a days hike out of here. We wont make it on foot by nightfall.  ,1,19
"SCULLY: Oh, you sent that call hours ago. I mean, help would have been here by now.  ",1,19
SCULLY: And if he doesnt?  ,1,19
"SCULLY: But sir, the very nature of the X-Files cases often precludes orthodox investigation.  ",1,20
"SCULLY: No, sir.  ",1,20
"SCULLY: No, sir. If anything, I'm suggesting that these cases be reviewed with... an open mind.  ",1,20
"SCULLY: On X-Files cases investigated by Agent Mulder and myself to date, we have a conviction or case solution of seventy-five percent. That's well above the current bureau standard.  ",1,20
"SCULLY: May I ask, sir, what more you require?  ",1,20
"SCULLY: I understand, however... conventional investigation of these cases may decrease the rate of success.  ",1,20
"SCULLY: Mulder, your testimony, you sounded so...  ",1,20
SCULLY: I was called into a meeting by Assistant Director Skinner.  ,1,20
SCULLY: Just wanted to reel me in.  ,1,20
"SCULLY: Mulder, wait...  ",1,20
"SCULLY: Okay, well then I'll keep surveillance with you.  ",1,20
SCULLY: That was thirty or sixty years ago.  ,1,20
"SCULLY: Mulder, that's going to entail unorthodox methods of investigation.  ",1,20
"SCULLY: Detective Briggs, you've helped us so much before. Now we have to prove that Tooms was involved in the killings you investigated thirty years ago. You've lived with this case half your life.  ",1,20
SCULLY: As were the four most recent murders.  ,1,20
SCULLY: That doesn't prove that it belongs to a person murdered by Tooms.  ,1,20
SCULLY: And what makes you positive?  ,1,20
SCULLY: And what does your instincts say about where Tooms buried the body?  ,1,20
SCULLY: Ground-penetrating radar. It bounces signals off of objects or cavities.  ,1,20
"SCULLY: Well, it signals if something inordinate is present. An experienced operator attempts to differentiate if the signal is a body or is stone or a hole in the ground.  ",1,20
SCULLY: Mm-hmmm.  ,1,20
"SCULLY: Well, it's an educated guess.  ",1,20
SCULLY: How are we doing?  ,1,20
SCULLY: Can you determine the cause of death? My instinct says that burial in cement is murder.  ,1,20
"SCULLY: Well, well keep it off the record.  ",1,20
"SCULLY: Well, its a start.  ",1,20
SCULLY: Ooh!  ,1,20
SCULLY: Its liverwurst.  ,1,20
"SCULLY: Mulder, you know that proper surveillance requires two pairs of agents, one pair relieving the other after twelve hours.  ",1,20
"SCULLY: This isnt about doing it by the book. This is about you not having slept for three days. Mulder, youre going to get sloppy and youre going to get hurt. Its inevitable at this point.  ",1,20
"SCULLY: Well, then Ill stay here. You go home.  ",1,20
SCULLY: Fox...  ,1,20
"SCULLY: Mulder, I wouldnt put myself on the line for anybody but you.  ",1,20
"SCULLY: Must be fate, Mulder. Root beer.  ",1,20
SCULLY: Wouldnt miss it for the world.  ,1,20
SCULLY: Sir? I was engaged in the unauthorized surveillance as well and Agent Mulder was orienting me on the situation at the time Tooms was admitted into the hospital. Agent Mulder could not have done it because he was with me.  ,1,20
"SCULLY: Sir, I would expect you to place the same trust in me as I do in you.  ",1,20
SCULLY: These are Eugene Tooms dental x-rays obtained from the Druid Hill Sanitarium. Your sandwich the other night gave me an idea. Dr. Plith had mentioned that he found gnawing on the rib cage near the location of the liver.  ,1,20
SCULLY: This software can create an exact three-dimensional model of Tooms mouth from the dental radiograph.  ,1,20
SCULLY: Where would he go?  ,1,20
"SCULLY: No, I already checked on that. They tore down that apartment building he lived in.  ",1,20
"SCULLY: If he is drawn to this location for some reason, maybe this nest is in the approximate location of his previous nest.  ",1,20
SCULLY: (off in distance) Mulder?  ,1,20
"SCULLY: Okay, lets go.  ",1,20
SCULLY: The caterpillar?  ,1,20
SCULLY: How do you know?  ,1,20
"SCULLY: You said there was one witness, a little girl. What did she say happened?  ",1,21
"SCULLY: Well, it stands to reason that somebody ...  ",1,21
SCULLY: Was he depressed or under psychiatric care of any kind?  ,1,21
"SCULLY: You don't really think the girl had anything to do with it, do you?  ",1,21
SCULLY: Do you have any idea how your daughter might have gotten there? Buffalo's half an hour away by train and the station is a five minute car ride.  ,1,21
SCULLY: And Mrs. Dougherty is?  ,1,21
SCULLY: What seems to be the problem?  ,1,21
SCULLY: How do you mean?  ,1,21
SCULLY: Frightens you how?  ,1,21
SCULLY: Tell me.  ,1,21
SCULLY: Your husband? Where is he now?  ,1,21
SCULLY: It's beautiful.  ,1,21
SCULLY: Wait a minute. We have an autopsy at 7.  ,1,21
SCULLY: Why?  ,1,21
SCULLY: Are you saying Michelle possesses the ability to psychically project her own will?  ,1,21
"SCULLY: Note postmortem examination is being conducted 11 hours and 45 minutes after subject was pronounced. (she sees a large red area on the body's lower chest) Note raised lesion approximately 7 centimeters below sternum. Deep necrosis inconsistent with cause of death as pronounced by Dr. Gilder, and suggests localized electrocution ... but a further tissue analysis will be necessary.  ",1,21
SCULLY: I just started the autopsy.  ,1,21
"SCULLY: (to photographer) Will you, uh, take a couple for scale, please. Thank you. I'll be right back.  ",1,21
SCULLY: Looks like a match.  ,1,21
SCULLY: Do you know him?  ,1,21
SCULLY: Where is he now? Has he been transferred?  ,1,21
"SCULLY: He was killed in Chinatown - gangland style, allegedly by the Triads, although no arrests were ever made. Now Mulder, if you're gonna tell me that you think Michelle Bishop saw a poltergeist ...  ",1,21
"SCULLY: ""Could have been"" being the operative phrase. Now, I'm not going to know for sure until the lab results are in, and even then ...  ",1,21
SCULLY: Because sometimes ...  ,1,21
SCULLY: ... looking for extreme possibilities makes you blind to the probable explanation right in front of you.  ,1,21
SCULLY: This is the face that Michelle Bishop saw. She walked right by here and she saw the face of Charlie Morris ... which means that there weren't any ghosts flying around the precinct.  ,1,21
"SCULLY: Yeah, I have what's been declassified. Why?  ",1,21
"SCULLY: Yes, I told you. It was a signature hit.  ",1,21
"SCULLY: His arm was severed just below the shoulder, presumably by a chainsaw, and his right eye was gouged out.  ",1,21
"SCULLY: Yeah, this won't take long.  ",1,21
"SCULLY: Detective, we're under the direct authority of Captain Gershom at the 14th precinct.  ",1,21
SCULLY: Did you know the detective?  ,1,21
"SCULLY: Sir, would you mind ...  ",1,21
SCULLY: Sure.  ,1,21
SCULLY: Did you notice her hands?  ,1,21
"SCULLY: He said she was sleeping, but her hands were dusted with baking flour.  ",1,21
SCULLY: We don't know. All we know is that your daughter has witnessed two deaths in the past two days.  ,1,21
SCULLY: Is there anything that you haven't told us? Is there anything at all that you can think of that might shed some light on what happened tonight?  ,1,21
"SCULLY: Well, this police station has a designated room at the Sheraton. An officer will take you and Michelle over there.  ",1,21
SCULLY: Four cops.  ,1,21
SCULLY: Their only connection being a drug bust in Chinatown almost nine years ago.  ,1,21
"SCULLY: Well, for one thing Fiore said he only knew Barbala by reputation.  ",1,21
SCULLY: I don't know.  ,1,21
SCULLY: There's a page gone from Morris' homicide file. Wonder where it could be?  ,1,21
SCULLY: Should be. Yeah. (she reads from the log sheet on the file folder) Tony Fiore - checked out this afternoon.  ,1,21
"SCULLY: Mrs. Fiore, we're sorry for the early hour, but is your husband home?  ",1,21
SCULLY: Does your husband have any family or close friends in the area that he might go to if he were in trouble?  ,1,21
"SCULLY: Mrs. Fiore, did your husband ever mention a detective by the name of Rudy Barbala or an ex-police officer named Leon Felder?  ",1,21
"SCULLY: Not Charlie Morris, Tony's ex-partner?  ",1,21
"SCULLY: Do me a favor, Mulder. Let me say it. Reincarnation.  ",1,21
SCULLY: All based on the coincidence that Michelle Bishop and Officer Morris both practice the obscure art of paper folding?  ,1,21
"SCULLY: So what, you think he's back like Peter Proud to avenge his murder?  ",1,21
SCULLY: That still doesn't explain how an eight-year-old girl can kill two grown men.  ,1,21
SCULLY: So where does that leave us?  ,1,21
SCULLY: They just left.  ,1,21
SCULLY: I know.  ,1,21
"SCULLY: Mrs. Bishop won't go for that, not in this lifetime anyway.  ",1,21
"SCULLY: How? And to what end? I mean, what exactly do you hope to discover by all this?  ",1,21
SCULLY: We'll find the truth when we find Fiore.  ,1,21
SCULLY: What I saw was some traumatized little girl who for no apparent reason has some connection to Charlie Morris.  ,1,21
SCULLY: Mulder ...  ,1,21
"SCULLY: OK. Let's just say that, by some small miracle, you manage to convince Michelle's mother, and the next hypno-regression provides you with everything you could possible hope for. No grand jury is gonna listen to that kind of testimony. We still will not have an actionable case.  ",1,21
SCULLY: Which means?  ,1,21
SCULLY: How is that possible?  ,1,21
SCULLY: Pathologists are paranoid by nature.  ,1,21
"SCULLY: Great. (reads it) Apparently, Charlie Morris did not die as a result of his wounds. Says here there's a frothing of fluid in the respiratory tract. That indicates death by drowning.  ",1,21
SCULLY: Um-hmm. That's right. Suggesting that he was killed in either a bathtub or a toilet. Except ...  ,1,21
SCULLY: The marked bradycardia. That indicates a raised plasma sodium level. He was killed in sea water.  ,1,21
"SCULLY: Mulder, what is it?  ",1,21
SCULLY: Right. So?  ,1,21
SCULLY: Mulder!  ,1,21
SCULLY: You mean the part where the groom passed out or the dog bit the drummer?  ,1,22
SCULLY: May-be. (looking at a folder in Mulder's hand) So is that what you couldn't talk to me about over the phone?  ,1,22
SCULLY: (reading the label on it) The Icarus project?  ,1,22
SCULLY: And Ronald Surnow was an aeronautical scientist who worked on it here at the university.  ,1,22
SCULLY: How close are they?  ,1,22
"SCULLY: OK, but how is this an X-file? Mulder, you don't think this has anything to do with UFO technology?  ",1,22
SCULLY: How do you suppose he became trapped in the wind tunnel?  ,1,22
SCULLY: By computer?  ,1,22
SCULLY: Another member of your team died a short time ago. Isn't that correct?  ,1,22
SCULLY: Are you certain it was an accident?  ,1,22
SCULLY: Your work seems to be a perfect target for industrial espionage.  ,1,22
SCULLY: How do you know?  ,1,22
"SCULLY: Do you remember seeing anything unusual? Seeing any strangers? (Roland shakes his head.) Did, um, did Dr. Surnow or Dr. Keats or Dr. Nollette do anything unusual?  ",1,22
SCULLY: You must like stars.  ,1,22
SCULLY: Sorry?  ,1,22
"SCULLY: Roland, let me help you.  ",1,22
SCULLY: What is it?  ,1,22
SCULLY: You don't really think that Roland ...  ,1,22
"SCULLY: Yes, but we're talking about a sophisticated fluid dynamics equation. Roland Fuller barely has an IQ of 70.  ",1,22
"SCULLY: Yes, but even savants behave only as human calculators. I mean, they can perform certain functions but they can't tell you the value of anything or even the meaning of a number.  ",1,22
"SCULLY: An organic object exposed to liquid nitrogen at minus 320 degrees will become frozen, exhibiting great tensile strength, but is vulnerable to stress from compression or impact. Now, I've seen this demonstrated on a fish before ...  ",1,22
"SCULLY: But look, someone else entered a file under the name Arthur after 12:31.  ",1,22
"SCULLY: Well, it couldn't have been Keats. Judging from the rigor of the body, he was dead around 12:30.  ",1,22
"SCULLY: Well, I can't access the ARTHUR file. We're gonna need the password.  ",1,22
SCULLY: How did you know that that ...  ,1,22
SCULLY: How did you know what the password was?  ,1,22
"SCULLY: Mrs. Stodie, can I talk to you a second? See you later, Roland.  ",1,22
SCULLY: Has Roland ever mentioned the name Arthur?  ,1,22
"SCULLY: Mrs. Stodie, can I get a copy of Roland's file and past history?  ",1,22
"SCULLY: I understand, but I have grounds to obtain them, and the less time we have to spend in court, the more time we have to help Roland.  ",1,22
SCULLY: Are you suggesting that Arthur Grable hired Roland in order to use him? (Mulder arches his eyebrows) And are you suggesting that Arthur Grable is not dead?  ,1,22
"SCULLY: Yeah, but by the look of this, (she holds up a photo of Grable's accident scene) he's hamburger.  ",1,22
"SCULLY: (reading from Grable's file) This obituary says that Arthur Grable was born in Seattle. His father was a big banker, his mother was active in a number of charities. Only child. Summa cum laude in physics. Doctoral and post-doctoral in aeronautical engineering at Harvey Mudd. Brilliant future, tragically cut short.  ",1,22
SCULLY: Does it say when he was born?  ,1,22
SCULLY: (also flipping through pages) That's also Arthur's birthdate.  ,1,22
"SCULLY: Is that Arthur Grable there, sitting on the chair?  ",1,22
SCULLY: Was he a practical joker?  ,1,22
SCULLY: Could he have faked his own death?  ,1,22
SCULLY: How can you be so certain?  ,1,22
"SCULLY: Wouldn't your client find it somewhat inconvenient to be thawed out in the future, only to discover he had no functional mobility?  ",1,22
"SCULLY: May we take a look at Arthur Grable's records? (he hands her a file) Thank you. Dr. Barrington, in your conception of future medical science, what requirements will exist to be an organ or tissue donor?  ",1,22
SCULLY: Mulder? Arthur Grable put down only one donor.  ,1,22
"SCULLY: No, lose the whole beard.  ",1,22
SCULLY: That's Roland.  ,1,22
"SCULLY: Mulder, no one's gonna provide you with anything once you explain your theory on how Roland Fuller is capable of these murders.  ",1,22
SCULLY: Yeah. I've got an older one and a younger one.  ,1,22
SCULLY: Does this pitch somehow end with a way for me to lower my long distance charges?  ,1,22
"SCULLY: OK, maybe. But in this case, one sibling has closer ties to a frozen fudgesicle than he does to his own brother.  ",1,22
SCULLY: But why? He's been working with these colleagues for years.  ,1,22
SCULLY: OK. Let's go. I have to call my brother.  ,1,22
SCULLY: Let's talk to campus security.  ,1,22
"SCULLY: No, we go left.  ",1,22
"SCULLY: Arthur and Roland Grable, born at Puget Presbyterian to Mr. and Mrs. Louis Grable on July 15, 1952. Arthur was four minutes older than Roland.  ",1,22
SCULLY: Which means that they're the result of a single egg fertilized by a single sperm.  ,1,22
SCULLY: So that maybe Roland's condition is the result of a damaged chromosome rejected by one of Arthur's cells?  ,1,22
SCULLY: In a way. (the phone rings) (to phone) Agent Scully.  ,1,22
SCULLY: Uh-huh.  ,1,22
SCULLY: Was there any tissue damage?  ,1,22
SCULLY: (hangs up) (to Mulder) Someone tampered with Arthur Grable's capsule. They're attempting to stabilize it now.  ,1,22
"SCULLY: (to Mulder) Wait. (to Roland) Roland, we need you to help us. Please, we need you to help us to stop the machine.  ",1,22
"SCULLY: Try to remember how. Roland, you've got to help him or he's going to die.  ",1,22
SCULLY: He'll be held in psychiatric custody for evaluation.  ,1,22
SCULLY: The D.A. hasn't made that determination yet.  ,1,22
"SCULLY: We're not sure, Mrs. Stodie. All we know is that Roland was somehow able to finish his brother's research.  ",1,22
"SCULLY: Mulder, you've been through this tape a hundred times. What exactly are you hoping to find?  ",1,23
SCULLY: And all he told you to was to watch channel eight?  ,1,23
SCULLY: Do we even know why the suspect was being chased?  ,1,23
"SCULLY: Well, that ought to put him in the Ten Most Wanted list.  ",1,23
"SCULLY: How do you know he's not just yanking your chain, this Deep Throat character?  ",1,23
"SCULLY: Well, he has lied to you by his own admission.  ",1,23
SCULLY: Then what are you missing?  ,1,23
"SCULLY: The report says that the car was registered to a rental agency in Gaithersburg. They had no idea that the car was even missing. You know, Mulder, I think that we're wasting our time here.  ",1,23
SCULLY: What?  ,1,23
SCULLY: It's not the same car.  ,1,23
SCULLY: It's called a caduceus. It's sort of the adopted symbol of the medical profession.  ,1,23
SCULLY: Mm-hmmm. (in agreement.)  ,1,23
SCULLY: Fast-forward.  ,1,23
SCULLY: Why would they do that?  ,1,23
"SCULLY: I'm sorry, I thought they were friendly.  ",1,23
"SCULLY: No, but he tried to.  ",1,23
SCULLY: No.  ,1,23
"SCULLY: I mean, this has reached the point of absurdity, Mulder. We're out here on half a hunch off of a cryptic phone call chasing down a, a clue that's based on nothing but speculation.  ",1,23
"SCULLY: That's all he's given us. Who is this Deep Throat character? I mean, we don't know anything about him. What his name is, what he does...  ",1,23
SCULLY: You don't know that this isn't just a game with him. He's toying with you. Rationing out the facts.  ,1,23
SCULLY: No. I think he does it because you do.  ,1,23
"SCULLY: The county sheriff's office is conducting the investigation. On the preliminary reports, it's being listed as a suicide.  ",1,23
"SCULLY: Yeah, they think that for whatever reason, he trashed his lab and then killed himself.  ",1,23
"SCULLY: Well, it says he tied one end of a roll of medical gauze around his neck and the other end to this gas outlet.  ",1,23
SCULLY: Nope.  ,1,23
"SCULLY: I know, that gauze is troubling.  ",1,23
"SCULLY: Ummm... ""Terrence Allen Berube. Harvard Med., 1974."" He was working on the Human Genome Project. Are you familiar with that?  ",1,23
"SCULLY: Right, but there's nothing extraordinary about that. I mean, there were thousands of scientists working on that project.  ",1,23
"SCULLY: I'm sorry, Mulder. I'm seeing the pieces but I'm not seeing the connection.  ",1,23
SCULLY: I don't know.  ,1,23
SCULLY: What are you going to do?  ,1,23
"SCULLY: Okay, Mulder, but I'm warning you... if this is monkey pee, you're on your own.  ",1,23
SCULLY: It was recovered at a crime scene.  ,1,23
"SCULLY: No, I'm expecting it to turn out to be nothing.  ",1,23
SCULLY: What are they?  ,1,23
SCULLY: How do you mean?  ,1,23
SCULLY: You have no way of identifying them?  ,1,23
"SCULLY: No, no, I'll wait.  ",1,23
SCULLY: It's me.  ,1,23
SCULLY: Who?  ,1,23
SCULLY: Where is he now?  ,1,23
SCULLY: I'm at the Georgetown Microbiology Department.  ,1,23
"SCULLY: Much. And it's not silver, it's green.  ",1,23
"SCULLY: Some kind of bacteria, each containing virus and it looks as if Berube may have been cloning them.  ",1,23
"SCULLY: Well, the only reason why you clone a virus inside a bacteria...  ",1,23
"SCULLY: Yeah, they're just about to run some primary cell cultures and a DNA sequence.  ",1,23
"SCULLY: Oh, Doctor Carpenter. I fell asleep.  ",1,23
"SCULLY: Yeah, I think those are genes.  ",1,23
SCULLY: Why is that?  ,1,23
SCULLY: What exactly did you find?  ,1,23
SCULLY: Mulder? Where on God's earth have you been? I've been trying to call you all night.  ,1,23
SCULLY: Mulder... that bacteria I had analyzed... they're saying that it doesn't exist in nature.  ,1,23
SCULLY: What?  ,1,23
SCULLY: Wait a second... Mulder?  ,1,23
"SCULLY: No, um... if you'd had listened to me, we wouldn't be here right now. I should know by now to trust your instincts.  ",1,23
"SCULLY: You know, I've always held science as sacred. I've, I've always put my trust in the accepted facts. And what I saw last night... for the first time in my life, I don't know what to believe.  ",1,23
SCULLY: What happened to them?  ,1,23
SCULLY: Were those the same men who killed Doctor Berube?  ,1,23
SCULLY: Why?  ,1,23
SCULLY: What was he running from?  ,1,23
SCULLY: There's just one thing I don't understand. Why you gave us so little to go on in the beginning and why are you giving us so much now?  ,1,23
SCULLY: I'm going to get back to Georgetown and get all the lab work.  ,1,23
SCULLY: Where?  ,1,23
SCULLY: Excuse me? I'm looking for Doctor Ann Carpenter. I've been unable to reach her by phone and she's not in her office.  ,1,23
SCULLY: Where is he? He's been gone all night.  ,1,23
SCULLY: Something's happened to him.  ,1,23
SCULLY: How do you know that?  ,1,23
SCULLY: I don't have any evidence. They took the evidence and they may have killed in order to get it.  ,1,23
SCULLY: Where?  ,1,23
SCULLY: Inside where?  ,1,23
SCULLY: What do they have there?  ,1,23
SCULLY: Dana Scully.  ,1,23
SCULLY: Federal government.  ,1,23
SCULLY: Purity control.  ,1,23
SCULLY: You're late.  ,1,23
SCULLY: Yes.  ,1,23
SCULLY: You spoke to them?  ,1,23
"SCULLY: No, sir. I'll make the exchange.  ",1,23
SCULLY: I don't trust you.  ,1,23
SCULLY: I don't know who you are. I know nothing about you.  ,1,23
SCULLY: So why give it back to them?  ,1,23
SCULLY: At the risk of so many other lives?  ,1,23
SCULLY: No!  ,1,23
SCULLY: Hello?  ,1,23
SCULLY: Where are you?  ,1,23
SCULLY: What?  ,1,23
SCULLY: Who said that?  ,1,23
SCULLY: Mulder...  ,1,23
"SCULLY: Well, you have to lodge a protest. They can't...  ",1,23
SCULLY: What are you going to do?  ,1,23
SCULLY: It is advantageous to begin an autopsy with removal of the cranium. The cranium is opened with a horizontal division an inch above the eyebrow ridges.  ,2,1
"SCULLY: What this man imagined... his dreams, who he loved, saw, heard, remembered... what he feared... somehow its... all locked inside this small mass of tissue and fluid.  ",2,1
"SCULLY: Good afternoon, Agent Mulder.  ",2,1
"SCULLY: You know, Mulder, from... from back there, you look like him.  ",2,1
SCULLY: Deep Throat.  ,2,1
SCULLY: I wanted to talk but I havent found anything.  ,2,1
"SCULLY: Mulder, I havent seen any indication...  ",2,1
"SCULLY: Ive taken all of the necessary precautions. I have doubled back over my tracks to make sure that I havent been followed and no one has ever followed me. The X-Files have been terminated, Mulder. We have been reassigned. I mean, what makes you think they care about us anymore anyway?  ",2,1
SCULLY: Because I realized that it was the only way that you would see me.  ,2,1
"SCULLY: To know that youre all right. Mulder, you passed me today within a foot, but you were miles away.  ",2,1
"SCULLY: Mulder, I know that you feel... frustrated that without the bureaus resources, its impossible for you to continue...  ",2,1
"SCULLY: Well, what then? When the bureau first shut us down, you said that you would go on for as long as the truth was out there. But I no longer feel that from you.  ",2,1
SCULLY: Yeah.  ,2,1
SCULLY: No.  ,2,1
"SCULLY: And youre worried that all your life, youve been seeing elves?  ",2,1
"SCULLY: But, Mulder... during your time with the X-Files, youve seen so much.  ",2,1
"SCULLY: Your sisters abduction, youve held onto that.  ",2,1
"SCULLY: Mulder, even if George Hale only saw elves in his mind, the telescope still got built. Dont give up. And next time...  ",2,1
SCULLY ON TAPE: Yesterday.  ,2,1
SCULLY ON TAPE: In the bullpen hallway.  ,2,1
SCULLY ON TAPE: No. Is he in some kind of trouble?  ,2,1
"SCULLY ON TAPE: Sir, Ill volunteer my time to assist in any search.  ",2,1
"SCULLY: ""Galactic latitude?""  ",2,1
SCULLY: Are you following me?  ,2,1
SCULLY: I was told by the Assistant Director that Mulder was gone.  ,2,1
"SCULLY: So, whenever hes away, I feed his fish.  ",2,1
SCULLY: Damn.  ,2,1
SCULLY: That would be bad for the fish.  ,2,1
"SCULLY: The ""wow"" signal?  ",2,1
SCULLY: What was there?  ,2,1
SCULLY: Maybe you can tell me. Is that from Ohio State?  ,2,1
SCULLY: Mulder.  ,2,1
SCULLY: C.A 519. 7:05. 9:50.  ,2,1
SCULLY: Id like a ticket on the 6:30 flight to San Juan.  ,2,1
SCULLY: I was sure you were dead. Mulder? Its Scully. Dana Scully. Do you know where you are?  ,2,1
SCULLY: Here?  ,2,1
SCULLY: Proof of what?  ,2,1
SCULLY: Is that them?  ,2,1
SCULLY: We dont have time.  ,2,1
"SCULLY: Mulder, were never going to be able to get the body out of the country!  ",2,1
SCULLY: Mulder...  ,2,1
"SCULLY: You know, an electrical surge in the outlet the storm may have degaussed everything, erasing the entire tape.  ",2,1
SCULLY: Is this seat taken?  ,2,2
"SCULLY: Well, I'm armed, so I'll take my chances.  ",2,2
SCULLY: It's not exactly as if you've ever tried to fit into the program.  ,2,2
SCULLY: The bureau?  ,2,2
"SCULLY: Y, you could request a transfer to Quantico. Come back to the Behavioral Science Unit.  ",2,2
"SCULLY: Wh, what about this case you're working on?  ",2,2
SCULLY: Where's the body?  ,2,2
SCULLY: Maybe I can request to do the autopsy.  ,2,2
"SCULLY: There's a dead body, isn't there?  ",2,2
"SCULLY: Examination and autopsy of John Doe number one-zero-one-three-five-six. Case number D-P-one-one-two-one-four-eight. Special Agent Fox Mulder, field investigator. Body is an adult male, with advanced tissue decomposition, weighing a hundred and sixty-five pounds in extremis, sixty-nine inches in length. Intact skin is mottled and discolored, due to submergence in and exposure to a highly bacterial environment. Cause and time of death unknown.  ",2,2
"SCULLY: Mulder, it's me. I need to see you, I've got something here I think you should know about.  ",2,2
"SCULLY: Some kind of parasite near John Doe. I'm having it looked at, but I should know more by the time you get down here.  ",2,2
SCULLY: Close the door.  ,2,2
"SCULLY: Apparently, it had attached itself to the bile duct and was feeding off the liver.  ",2,2
"SCULLY: Believe it or not, something like forty million people are infected worldwide.  ",2,2
"SCULLY: Well, maybe you'd rather hear what you can catch from a nice, rare steak.  ",2,2
SCULLY: Flukes are endemic in unsanitary conditions. It's more likely that the victim contracted it down inside the sewer.  ,2,2
"SCULLY: I don't know. According to my sources, it's unlikely that a single parasite could have killed him. He was a young man. But the weird thing is, there's no other discernible cause of death.  ",2,2
SCULLY: They have what's called a scolex... it's a sucker-like mouth with four hooking spikes.  ,2,2
SCULLY: Where'd you get that?  ,2,2
SCULLY: And you're asking me if this is from a fluke?  ,2,2
"SCULLY: M, Mulder, the scolex is a tiny little organ. This is a huge bite mark.  ",2,2
"SCULLY: Mulder, I...  ",2,2
SCULLY: No.  ,2,2
SCULLY: Excuse me?  ,2,2
SCULLY: I didn't talk to anybody.  ,2,2
"SCULLY: Look, Mulder, I... I don't know what to say, but I, I, I wouldn't betray a confidence.  ",2,2
"SCULLY: The turbellarian flatworms are free-living carnivorous scavengers, usually less than three centimeters in length, found in fresh and sea water. They are hermaphroditic with complex reproductive systems, capable of internal fertilization. Many species require more than one host to complete a life cycle. Although the shape of the wound on the sanitation worker suggest scolex attachment, the sheer size of the wound precludes involvement of the common flukeworm.  ",2,2
SCULLY: Yeah.  ,2,2
SCULLY: I don't see it.  ,2,2
SCULLY: Oh my God.  ,2,2
"SCULLY: Platyhelminthis are often hermaphroditic. Mulder, this is amazing. It's vestigial features appear to be parasitic, but it has primate physiology.  ",2,2
SCULLY: He was a Russian. An engineer on a cargo freighter. He had a tattoo on his forearm.  ,2,2
"SCULLY: Somebody shoved this under my door. I guess you really do have a friend in the F.B.I. And, Mulder... when you see Skinner to hand in your field report, I know that it's your decision, but I hope that you know that I'd consider it more than a professional loss if you decided to leave.  ",2,2
"SCULLY: It's me, where are you?  ",2,2
SCULLY: How?  ,2,2
"SCULLY: Well, you're not going to like what I have to tell you?  ",2,2
"SCULLY: It hadn't occurred to me, but I think that the fluke in the corpse might have been an incubating larva.  ",2,2
SCULLY: It's looking for hosts. It attacks because the victims' bodies provide generative nourishment. Mulder...  ,2,2
SCULLY: If it finds a new host...  ,2,2
SCULLY: Is this seat taken?  ,2,2
SCULLY: I'll take my chances.  ,2,2
SCULLY: That came from Skinner?  ,2,2
SCULLY: I thought you might be interested in the lab results on the biology of the fluke larva.  ,2,2
"SCULLY: Yes, but still capable of spontaneous regeneration, like any fluke or flatworm.  ",2,2
"SCULLY: Radiation. Abnormal cell fusion. The suppression of natural genetic processes. Mulder, nature didn't make this thing. We did.  ",2,2
SCULLY: That creature came off of a decommissioned Russian freighter that was used in the disposal of salvage material from the meltdown. It was born in a... in a primordial soup of radioactive sewage.  ,2,2
SCULLY: I was wondering when you'd get to that.  ,2,3
"SCULLY: Several anomalies were discovered in post-mortem analysis that were undetected in previous autopsies. Levels of adrenaline are known to be high in cases of violent death, twice as much as in victims of natural death. This subject's levels were two-hundred times normal.  ",2,3
"SCULLY: I'm sorry, Mulder, he's right. I'd love to tell you that I flew three-hundred miles in the middle of the night to perform tests that prove that you're about to become the next Charles Manson... but I find little physiological evidence that L.S.D.M. has toxically affected you... even after massive ingestion.  ",2,3
"SCULLY: Yes, but you are proof that it wasn't from exposure to L.S.D.M.  ",2,3
SCULLY: Sure.  ,2,3
SCULLY: You mean like... sex and ice cubes in liquor in ice cube ads? That's paranoia.  ,2,3
SCULLY: And how is this connected with the spraying?  ,2,3
SCULLY: I'm still waiting.  ,2,3
SCULLY: By who?  ,2,3
"SCULLY: Mulder, I was wrong. Exposure to the insecticide does induce paranoia.  ",2,3
SCULLY: Controlled by who? By the government? By a corporation? By Reticulans?  ,2,3
"SCULLY: Yes, but why, Mulder? Why would they intentionally create a populace that destroys itself?  ",2,3
SCULLY: This is odd.  ,2,3
SCULLY: Door's unlocked.  ,2,3
SCULLY: Here it is.  ,2,3
"SCULLY: Nothing. I mean, he hasn't seen a doctor in decades.  ",2,3
SCULLY: Get the uniforms out of sight.  ,2,3
SCULLY: We'll have to wait him out.  ,2,3
SCULLY: Nothing.  ,2,3
"SCULLY: Scully. Hello? Mulder, is that you? Mulder, where are you? Mulder? Mulder, where are you?  ",2,3
"SCULLY:  Electrocution effects electrolytic conduction, disrupting the heart beat and most of the autonomic systems.  Death actually occurs from tissue damage, and necrosis in the heart itself, particularly in the sinus and the atria ventricular nodes. . .  ",2,4
SCULLY:  Excuse me.  ,2,4
SCULLY:  Where are you?  ,2,4
SCULLY:  Whats going on?  ,2,4
SCULLY:  I cant do it today.  My last class isnt until 4:30.  ,2,4
SCULLY:  Mulder. . .  ,2,4
SCULLY:  (lets out an exasperated sigh.)  Whats the name?  ,2,4
SCULLY:  Grissom didnt die from cardiac arrest.  ,2,4
SCULLY:  I think you should come down and take a look for yourself. I havent even started on the chest and abdomen yet and Ill have a lot more to tell you then.  ,2,4
SCULLY:  Stomach.  I was just about to start on it.  ,2,4
SCULLY:  Good to meet you.  ,2,4
SCULLY:  Notice the pugilistic attitude of the corpse.  ,2,4
SCULLY:  This condition generally occurs several hours after death. Its caused by a coagulation of muscle proteins when the body is exposed to extremely high temperatures.  ,2,4
SCULLY:  This degree of limb flexion is observed exclusively in burn-related victims.  ,2,4
"SCULLY:  And no epidermal burns to indicate as much but when I opened up the skull, I found external hemorrhages, which can only be caused by intense heat. Some how, this man suffered all of the secondary, but none of the primary physiological signs of being in a fire.  ",2,4
SCULLY:  I couldnt even begin to explain what could have caused this.  Its almost as if. . .  ,2,4
SCULLY:  Its almost as if his body believed that it was burning.  ,2,4
"SCULLY:  Also in the described in the report, is a highly experimental neurosurgical procedure meant to induce a permanent waking state. The procedure involved cutting out part of the brainstem in the mid-frontal region which would explain Henry Willigs scar. A similar scar should also be evident on Augustus Cole.  Post-op treatment also included a regiment of synthetic supplements to replenish the organic deficits caused by prolong lack of sleep.  This is consistent with the anti-depressants Cole robbed from the pharmacy. These drugs maintain serotonin  levels in the blood. Serotonin being the primary substance produced during sleep. While it is theoretically possible that this procedure greatly diminished the subjects need for sleep, I can neither quantify nor substantiate its success without further clinical evidence.  ",2,4
SCULLY:  Scully  ,2,4
SCULLY:  Im going over these reports you faxed me.  Theyre incredible.  ,2,4
"SCULLY:  Sleep eradication still doesnt explain the shooting of those two officers, or the anomalous autopsy results on Willig and Dr. Grissom.  ",2,4
"SCULLY:  They experience mild visual and auditory hallucinations, any first year med. student could tell you that.  ",2,4
SCULLY:  Are you suggesting that Cole killed these people with telepathic images?  ,2,4
"SCULLY:  Even if youre right, youll have a much better chance of finding Cole if you work up a profile and try to surmise his next move.  ",2,4
SCULLY:  Where are you going?  ,2,4
SCULLY:  Sounds like your new partners working out.  ,2,4
SCULLY:  Then I was?  ,2,4
"SCULLY:  Must be nice not having someone question your every move, poking holes in all your theories.  ",2,4
SCULLY: Youd better go.  Ill read over this report again and see what else I can come up with.  ,2,4
SCULLY:  I think I found the Francis Gerardi youre looking for. Hes a professor of neurosurgery at Harvard.  ,2,4
"SCULLY:  Yes, except hes coming to New York for Grissoms funeral, tonight.  HeS arriving at bronx station on the 7:30 train.  ",2,4
SCULLY:  Got it.  ,2,4
"SCULLY:  They broke into my office.  Went through my files, my computer. . .I came as soon as security called but the report was all ready gone.  ",2,4
"SCULLY:  Without that report as evidence, Skinners not going to authorize an investigation.  ",2,4
SCULLY:  Skinner?  ,2,4
SCULLY:  You actually met with him.  ,2,4
SCULLY:   Do you trust him  ,2,4
SCULLY: Scully.  ,2,5
"SCULLY: Yeah, I know. I've been watching it on TV. What's going on out there?  ",2,5
SCULLY: That an escaped mental patient is holding four people hostage in a travel agency.  ,2,5
SCULLY: Seriously?  ,2,5
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,2,5
SCULLY: Where's Mulder?  ,2,5
SCULLY: What?  ,2,5
SCULLY: You've got to get him out of there.  ,2,5
"SCULLY: No, you've got to get him out of there now or he's going to be killed!  ",2,5
SCULLY: Because Duane Barry is not what Mulder thinks he is.  ,2,5
"SCULLY: No, I don't think you understand what I'm telling you. I just flew down here from Washington...  ",2,5
"SCULLY: All right, well then let me speak to someone who's in charge.  ",2,5
"SCULLY: Don't tell me to calm down, I'm not going to calm down until I can talk to someone who will listen to what I'm saying!  ",2,5
SCULLY: I'm Special Agent Dana Scully and I have information that is vital to your negotiations.  ,2,5
"SCULLY: I think there has been a critical misjudgment here. This man who claims to be under the control of aliens, his, his mental health history describes a rare state of psychosis.  ",2,5
"SCULLY: The injury left him nearly incapable of functioning in society. It effectively destroyed the moral center of his brain. Now, almost a hundred years ago, there was a famous case. A man named Gage had a blasting rod pierce the same region.  ",2,5
"SCULLY: He became a pathological liar, suffering from severe delusions. His behavior was characterized as bizarre and violent with a tendency to act out his fantasies.  ",2,5
SCULLY: Agent Mulder called me. We used to work together.  ,2,5
SCULLY: Is there a way I can reach him with this information?  ,2,5
SCULLY: Mulder? It's me. Listen to me. You cannot trust Duane Barry.  ,2,5
"SCULLY: Mulder, he could snap at any time. He has a history of irrational and violent behavior.  ",2,5
"SCULLY: That's good, that's good, Mulder.  ",2,5
"SCULLY: This is the countdown, Mulder, they're coming at you.  ",2,5
"SCULLY: You okay, Mulder?  ",2,5
SCULLY: Whatever you're feeling... you did the right thing.  ,2,5
"SCULLY: Sometimes when you want to believe so badly, you end up... looking too hard.  ",2,5
SCULLY: This could just be a piece of shrapnel. Duane Barry did a tour of duty in Vietnam.  ,2,5
SCULLY: And you think that this was implanted?  ,2,5
SCULLY: Or some version of the truth.  ,2,5
SCULLY: What do you think?  ,2,5
SCULLY: That would make sense.  ,2,5
SCULLY: What?  ,2,5
SCULLY: Mm-hmm. Looks like some kind of a stamp.  ,2,5
"SCULLY: Uh, I don't know what happened.  ",2,5
"SCULLY: Mulder, it's me. I just had something incredibly strange happen. This piece of metal that they took out of Duane Barry, it has some kind of a code on it.  ",2,5
SCULLY: Mulder!  ,2,5
SCULLY: I need your help! Mulder!  ,2,5
"SCULLY ON MACHINE: Mulder, it's me. I just had something incredibly strange happen. This piece of metal that they took out of Duane Barry, it has some kind of a code on it. I ran it through a scanner and some kind of a serial number came up. What the hell is this thing, Mulder? It's almost as if... it's almost as if somebody was using it to catalogue him.  ",2,6
SCULLY ON MACHINE: Mulder!  ,2,6
SCULLY: Mulder!  ,2,6
SCULLY: I need your help!  ,2,6
"SCULLY: Not Fox, Mulder.  ",2,8
"SCULLY: Mulder, I dont remember anything... after Duane Barry...  ",2,8
SCULLY: I knew there was a reason to live.  ,2,8
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,2,8
SCULLY: (quietly) Thanks.  ,2,8
SCULLY: Hmm. Could I see Nurse Owens? Ive got something Id like her to have.  ,2,8
SCULLY: Owens. Short with straight light brown hair? She watched over me in intensive care and Id like to thank her.  ,2,8
SCULLY: I'd always heard that he was brilliant.  ,2,9
SCULLY: But that was alive.  ,2,9
SCULLY: Over what?  ,2,9
SCULLY: How soon can we get up there?  ,2,9
"SCULLY: Mulder, I appreciate your concern - but I'm ready. I want to work.  ",2,9
SCULLY: I've already lost too much time.  ,2,9
SCULLY: Shouldn't we find the rest of the descent team first?  ,2,9
SCULLY: Mulder!  ,2,9
SCULLY: What's going on?  ,2,9
SCULLY: Can you think of anything that might have caused or contributed to his behavior?  ,2,9
"SCULLY: You're part of the team, Jesse?  ",2,9
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,2,9
"SCULLY: Well, considering what they've been through, not especially.  ",2,9
"SCULLY: Well, they've been living in the middle of nowhere for almost a year. One of their team members is dead, probably at the hands of another. You have to expect some heightened level of emotional distress.  ",2,9
SCULLY: Based on what?  ,2,9
"SCULLY: Now, Mulder, you're sounding paranoid.  ",2,9
SCULLY: OK.  ,2,9
SCULLY: That should do it.  ,2,9
SCULLY: Do you have a freezer?  ,2,9
"SCULLY: (to Mulder) Why don't you radio for the helicopter, I'm almost done here.  ",2,9
SCULLY: Why not?  ,2,9
SCULLY: I know. He killed Pierce and probably Erikson. I think we should come back for him with a larger party.  ,2,9
SCULLY: What are you talking about?  ,2,9
"SCULLY: Mulder, nothing can live in a volcanic interior, not only because of the intense heat but the gases would be toxic to any organism.  ",2,9
SCULLY: (examining the paper) It describes the metabolism from hydrogen sulfide into silicon dioxide.  ,2,9
"SCULLY: But the fundamental building block for every organism known to man is carbon, from the smallest bacterium to the largest redwood tree.  ",2,9
"SCULLY: Mulder, that is science fiction. It's, it's an elaborate construct from a delusional mind. This doesn't prove anything.  ",2,9
"SCULLY: Mulder, whatever evidence Trepkos had, he destroyed.  ",2,9
"SCULLY: Why on earth would they do that? But, Mulder, the fact is that all of these people are suffering to varying degrees from post-traumatic stress, and from a strictly medical point of view, we have to get them out of here sooner rather than later.  ",2,9
SCULLY: Jesse? Can I talk to you? Are you OK?  ,2,9
"SCULLY: What happened here, Jesse? You can trust me.  ",2,9
SCULLY: Do you think the descent somehow triggered his breakdown?  ,2,9
SCULLY: Lithium carbonate.  ,2,9
"SCULLY: What are you so afraid of, Jesse?  ",2,9
SCULLY: Where is home?  ,2,9
"SCULLY: I can't tell whether it's an infection or a toxic reaction, but we've got to get him to a hospital.  ",2,9
SCULLY: Give me the short wave.  ,2,9
"SCULLY: (to radio) This is Agent Scully with the Firewalker team. Come in, Search and Rescue.  ",2,9
SCULLY: (to Mulder and Ludwig) You guys go ahead. I'll get O'Neil and meet you at the landing site.  ,2,9
"SCULLY: (to radio) Request dispatch of Med-Evac to our location immediately. We have an asian male, mid-thirties, spiking a high-grade fever.  ",2,9
SCULLY: Tanaka's collapsed. We're getting him out.  ,2,9
"SCULLY: Without better imaging equipment, I can't say for sure.  ",2,9
SCULLY: It appears to be some kind of a fungus.  ,2,9
"SCULLY: Well, I'm not a botanist, but I think it's fair to guess that it's an unknown genus.  ",2,9
"SCULLY: Spores. I scraped them off the tip of the fungus. It appears as if one of the spores grew inside of Tanaka until it reached reproductive maturity ... essentially outgrowing its host. But by then, it had already caused massive tissue damage, particularly to the respiratory tract.  ",2,9
"SCULLY: Maybe now there is, but we won't have conclusive proof until we determine its molecular structure.  ",2,9
"SCULLY: This might explain something else, though. The spore could explain Trepkos' dementia. Fungi often contain alkaloids that can affect the nervous system.  ",2,9
"SCULLY: We don't know that. If it was an airborne microbe, any of us could have inhaled the spore.  ",2,9
"SCULLY: Not until we know how it's transmitted, how it incubates. If even one of us is infected, we could risk infecting a much larger population.  ",2,9
SCULLY: (to Ludwig) Maybe you should go check up on O'Neil.  ,2,9
SCULLY: What if he's already dead?  ,2,9
"SCULLY: He's dangerous, Mulder. He's already killed two men.  ",2,9
SCULLY: Will you at least let me go with you?  ,2,9
"SCULLY: Look, I know what you're thinking but you have to get past that. We both do. I'm back, and I'm not going anywhere.  ",2,9
"SCULLY: (to recorder) I have attempted to culture the spore using temperatures ranging from human basal to those approximating the volcanic interior. I've used nutritive mediums, containing human tissue, blood and saliva, even sulfur. However, none of the seven trials have successfully grown the fungus that killed Tanaka. Based on this preliminary data, I've come to the following hypothesis: that unless these spores are ingested or inhaled by the host organism immediately upon their release, they become harmless ... effectively dead.  ",2,9
SCULLY: Jesse?  ,2,9
"SCULLY: I thought you might like to know, chances are good that none of us were infected. We were at a safe distance from Tanaka when the spores scattered, and as soon as Mulder and Ludwig come back we can leave. I, I just need to run a few more tests but I think we're going to be OK.  ",2,9
"SCULLY: OK, Jesse? Jesse?  ",2,9
SCULLY: Jesse?  ,2,9
"SCULLY: Oh! God, you scared me! Jesse? Are you OK? Jesse, what's wrong? Jesse?  ",2,9
"SCULLY: Jesse, what are you doing?  ",2,9
"SCULLY: I'm OK, I'm OK.  ",2,9
SCULLY: I'm OK.  ,2,9
SCULLY: Yeah.  ,2,9
SCULLY: Look. She was infected. I don't know how.  ,2,9
SCULLY: Did you find him?  ,2,9
"SCULLY: Mulder, what are you doing? They're going to want to question him.  ",2,9
SCULLY: What does that mean?  ,2,10
SCULLY: What does the police report say?  ,2,10
SCULLY: Any evidence of sexual assault?  ,2,10
SCULLY: Does it seem like it might have been a schoolboy prank?  ,2,10
SCULLY: Victims? You mean there've been others?  ,2,10
SCULLY: What's your interest in this?  ,2,10
SCULLY: What's that?  ,2,10
"SCULLY: What's the significance of the name ""Red Museum?""  ",2,10
"SCULLY: You know sheriff, from what little we've seen, what, what little you've told us, they seem rather unlikely to be involved in the kind of activities that you described.  ",2,10
SCULLY: What are walk-ins?  ,2,10
SCULLY: Hi.  ,2,10
SCULLY: Who are you?  ,2,10
"SCULLY: Oh, you're in all the pictures. You must be Gary's younger brother.  ",2,10
"SCULLY: Well, thank you for your time.  ",2,10
"SCULLY: You know, Mulder... ribs like these, I'd say the Church of the Red Museum has its work cut out for it.  ",2,10
SCULLY: To inhabitation by a new spirit.  ,2,10
SCULLY: But not Nixon?  ,2,10
SCULLY: So are you still subscribing to the sheriff's claims of a possession?  ,2,10
"SCULLY: Well, I'll tell you something, I kind of feel weird saying this...  ",2,10
"SCULLY: Yeah, what, what's going on?  ",2,10
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,2,10
SCULLY: Kind of hard to tell the villains without a scorecard.  ,2,10
SCULLY: I just examined the girl.  ,2,10
"SCULLY: Not much until the toxicology report came back. They found trace amounts of an unspecified alkaloid substance in her blood, possibly an opiate derivative, as well as a dangerously large quantity of something called scopolamine.  ",2,10
"SCULLY: Well, only in very small doses. Anything past .2 micrograms and you've got a very powerful anesthetic with hallucinogenic qualities. It's been in the news lately because Colombian gangs have been using it in kidnappings to subdue their victims.  ",2,10
"SCULLY: Yes, you'd probably have to be a doctor or a pharmacist to get hold of these quantities.  ",2,10
SCULLY: We can get a warrant if that's what it takes.  ,2,10
"SCULLY: Yes, sir, but you can't hide behind your rights if a crime has been committed.  ",2,10
"SCULLY: Are you familiar with a substance called scopolamine, Mister Odin?  ",2,10
SCULLY: Have you ever ordered others to do so?  ,2,10
SCULLY: Yes.  ,2,10
SCULLY: Why did you sell it?  ,2,10
SCULLY: You said you wanted to show us something.  ,2,10
SCULLY: A genetically-engineered growth hormone.  ,2,10
SCULLY: How do you mean?  ,2,10
SCULLY: But these hormones have been proven safe. They've been cleared by the F.D.A.  ,2,10
SCULLY: What about the second body?  ,2,10
SCULLY: Thank you.  ,2,10
SCULLY: I think we'll know more once we find out what this is.  ,2,10
"SCULLY: You're sure? Both kids? No, it's okay, I'm... I'm sure you're correct. Thank you very much.  ",2,10
SCULLY: You found a connection between the out-of-town kids and the kids abducted here. Every one of them was delivered and treated through childhood by Doctor Larson.  ,2,10
SCULLY: Why would he carry a list of credit card numbers?  ,2,10
SCULLY: But why? And what was he treating them for?  ,2,10
SCULLY: I don't know. We won't get the test results back on the vial until tomorrow. Are you thinking it might be bovine growth hormone?  ,2,10
SCULLY: I know. And it still doesn't answer the question of who's marking those kids... or why.  ,2,10
SCULLY: Hi. Sorry to come unannounced.  ,2,10
"SCULLY: Actually, we wanted to talk with you, if that's okay.  ",2,10
"SCULLY: Well, thinking back, was there anything that seemed strange to you? Was Gary sick often?  ",2,10
SCULLY: Why was he going to Doctor Larson?  ,2,10
SCULLY: Jay's your husband?  ,2,10
SCULLY: What accident?  ,2,10
"SCULLY: What is it, Mulder?  ",2,10
SCULLY: What?  ,2,10
SCULLY: His name is Gerd Thomas. He's owned the building for twenty-one years. He used to run a day-care center out of it. They're holding him for us.  ,2,10
SCULLY: I know that face.  ,2,10
SCULLY: Excuse me.  ,2,10
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,2,10
"SCULLY: I, uh... I think he's telling the truth. I don't think he killed anyone.  ",2,10
"SCULLY: I just got the toxicology report back on the broken vial. The residual substance couldn't be analyzed because it contained synthetic corticosteroids with unidentified amino acids. That's ""Purity Control,"" Mulder.  ",2,10
SCULLY: The man who died in that plane crash was inoculating those kids with antibodies derived from what may have been an extraterrestrial source.  ,2,10
"SCULLY: No, Mulder, that was never proven conclusively.  ",2,10
SCULLY: Yes.  ,2,10
SCULLY: Does that man know anything about it?  ,2,10
"SCULLY: Well, I think his boss must have because they just found him shot to death in a cow pasture.  ",2,10
"SCULLY: I think I know who shot him, Mulder. That man that I recognized on the road today... that's the same man that executed Deep Throat.  ",2,10
SCULLY: Sheriff... where's Mulder?  ,2,10
SCULLY: Don't move!  ,2,10
"SCULLY: File number XWC060361. The identity of the man shot in the slaughterhouse has yet to be determined. His name, any record or artifact of his past, present or immigration status have yet to be found. His fingerprints are not on file in either the F.B.I. or National System of Records. At this time, it remains doubtful that anyone will come forward to I.D. or claim the body.  ",2,10
"SCULLY: Under further analysis, the inoculant found in the broken vials was isolated and determined to be an unstable antibody of no known biological origin. After three weeks of study, the components of the serum, probably synthetic, have broken down structurally and, in this retrograde state, cannot be analyzed further. This coincides with the development of a severe and undiagnosed flu-like ailment affecting the children who were believed to be inoculated and some of the local families.  ",2,10
SCULLY: (glancing over her shoulder) Good morning.  ,2,11
SCULLY: Good. Because I put it back in that drawer with all those other videos that arent yours.  ,2,11
"SCULLY: No. This is Michelle Charters. Shes a registered nurse at a convalescent home in Worchester, Massachusetts.  ",2,11
"SCULLY: According to Miss Charters, she was raped. The abrasions and contusions here would be consistent with her claims as would be the medical report which cites the kind of injury and tearing associated with sexual trauma.  ",2,11
SCULLY: No. The woman made the video herself. It seems that no one will believe her story.  ,2,11
SCULLY: Because she claims to have been raped by an invisible entity. A spirit being.  ,2,11
SCULLY: I know. Ive been here since 6:00 this morning going through them.  ,2,11
SCULLY: Not surprisingly.  ,2,11
SCULLY: Yes. But this case is different.  ,2,11
SCULLY: The victim has filed a lawsuit against the government. She seems to be certain who the spirit being is.  ,2,11
SCULLY: And you know him ?  ,2,11
SCULLY: I know this is hard for you.  ,2,11
SCULLY: To continue our investigation were going to need some kind of evidence  physical or   ,2,11
SCULLY: Did you ever threaten Miss Charters?  ,2,11
SCULLY: (louder) Did you ever threaten Miss Charters?  ,2,11
SCULLY: She says you made advances.  ,2,11
SCULLY: (louder) Advances?  ,2,11
"SCULLY: What do you think, Mulder?  ",2,11
SCULLY: About his story.  ,2,11
SCULLY: But in a substantiated crime.  ,2,11
SCULLY: Is there still a medical staff?  ,2,11
SCULLY: What kind of treatment?  ,2,11
SCULLY: Was he receiving special treatment?  ,2,11
SCULLY: Are you saying you dont believe Nurse Charters allegations of rape?  ,2,11
SCULLY: This is Michelle Charters?  ,2,11
"SCULLY: Id like to review it myself, if thats okay?  ",2,11
SCULLY: Call 911. Hal. Can you speak? (no response) I think this mans in ventricular fibrillation. I need 75 milligrams of Lidocaine and one amp of Amphinephrine. Stat.  ,2,11
SCULLY: And get me a defibrillator!  ,2,11
"SCULLY: Hes turning cyanotic. Come on, Hal. You gotta help me.  ",2,11
SCULLY: Im losing him. Whats taking them so long?  ,2,11
SCULLY: A setback?  ,2,11
SCULLY: But Alzheimers isnt treatable.  ,2,11
"SCULLY: Ive read about it, but Ive also read that the clinical benefits are marginal at best.  ",2,11
SCULLY: Would it be possible for us to take a look at other patients in your test group?  ,2,11
SCULLY: Yeah.  ,2,11
SCULLY: Can I get a copy of Hal Ardens autopsy results?  ,2,11
SCULLY: Thank you.  ,2,11
"SCULLY: Leo, were with the FBI. We have some questions that wed like to ask you.  ",2,11
SCULLY: Dr. Grago tells us that you havent been able to work in years. That the medicine has improved   ,2,11
SCULLY: What is it then?  ,2,11
SCULLY: .to find not just the treatment but a cure for Alzheimers. Do you realize how important that would be?  ,2,11
SCULLY: Any progress at all   ,2,11
SCULLY: What if theres a connection?  ,2,11
SCULLY: Dr. Gragos therapy produces acetylcholine. Too much cholinergic activity causes a phychotic state similar to schizophrenia.  ,2,11
SCULLY: Its possible.  ,2,11
"SCULLY: Well, maybe its not in the medication. Maybe its the place itself.  ",2,11
"SCULLY: Im talking about an environmental reason behind whats happening there. Even the disinfectant couldnt mask that smell. Who knows whats breeding behind the walls or in the sub-structure. Some fungal contaminants have been known to cause delusions, dementia, violent behaviour  ",2,11
SCULLY: Maybe it has.  ,2,11
"SCULLY: Her lip required 13 stitches. The blow to her head resulted in a subdural hematoma. Thats quite a concoction. Look, I just want to talk to a few more patients there. We can catch the same flight out tomorrow night.  ",2,11
SCULLY: Yes. Wed like to have a word with Mr. Phillips.  ,2,11
SCULLY: Were with the FBI. We have a few questions concerning his medical treatment. (shows badge)  ,2,11
"SCULLY: Its hard for anyone to be here, including the residents.  ",2,11
SCULLY: How many years has he been here?  ,2,11
SCULLY: Its routine procedure.  ,2,11
SCULLY: Youll have to ask Dr. Grago.  ,2,11
"SCULLY: (looking in the empty room) Theres nobody in your room, Dorothy.  ",2,11
SCULLY: Is she going to be all right?  ,2,11
"SCULLY: (uncomfortable, passing DOROTHY, heading down the hall) Excuse me.  ",2,11
SCULLY: Mulder   ,2,11
"SCULLY: (looking at the chart) Well, not necessarily. This is only a trace amount but small amounts are known to cause hallucinations which is what one of your patients is having right now down the hall.  ",2,11
"SCULLY: Oh, my God.  ",2,11
SCULLY: Leo?  ,2,11
SCULLY: Its incredible   ,2,11
SCULLY: Why were you growing them?  ,2,11
SCULLY: Were you feeding them to the residents here?  ,2,11
SCULLY: For what purpose?  ,2,11
"SCULLY: Are you saying that a spirit killed this man, Upshaw?  ",2,11
SCULLY: About?  ,2,11
"SCULLY: Mulder, mushrooms arent medication. They taste good on hamburgers, but they dont raise the dead.  ",2,11
SCULLY: I think youve been reading too much Carlos Castenada.  ,2,11
"SCULLY: I know --- a shaman gets intoxicated, he has dreams or hallucinations, and he interprets them. I dont think its any more magical than that.  ",2,11
"SCULLY: Well, I think, if anything, these mushrooms are a poison to the system and I think thats what killed Hal Arden.  ",2,11
SCULLY: (trying to open the door which has just slammed in her face) Mulder! Whats going on!? Mulder!? Mulder!  ,2,11
SCULLY: Theyre trapped in the bathroom and its filling with water.  ,2,11
SCULLY: Wheres the main water shutoff?  ,2,11
SCULLY: Gung will know. (begins running off to find GUNG) Keep trying the door.  ,2,11
SCULLY: See if you can find something to force it with.  ,2,11
SCULLY: You stay with him. Ill get help. (runs down hall to the bathroom door) Dr. Grago! Dr. Grago.  ,2,11
SCULLY: Do you have any atropine in your kit here?  ,2,11
SCULLY: Stan Phillips has gone into convulsions. I think he might have poisoned himself.  ,2,11
"SCULLY: You okay, Mulder?  ",2,11
"SCULLY: (voiceover) In response to the series of unexplained incidents at the Excelsius Dei convalescent home, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health has assumed all administrative authority at the facility. They detected trace amounts of ibotenic acid in more than half the residents tested. Though these levels have dissipated rapidly.  ",2,11
"SCULLY: (voiceover, cont.) Dr. John Grago has been replaced as head physician at the facility and his trial use of the drug Depranil has been suspended. For his admitted part in manufacturing and distributing an illicit substance, Gung Bittouin was remanded to the Immigration and Naturalization Service and is awaiting repatriation to Malaysia. There are reportedly no efforts being made to study the mushrooms.  ",2,11
"SCULLY: (voiceover, cont.) The federal government has settled Michelle Charters lawsuit out of court though no clear blame has been placed. Witnesses to the events have been unreliable due to dramatic relapses and a general reversal in their progress with Alzheimers disease.  ",2,11
SCULLY: Any cavities?  ,2,12
"SCULLY: Well, there's a filling on the occlusal surface of the upper left bicuspid here and here (pointing at the X-rays) and he's congenitally missing a lower left bicuspid here and here ... Yeah, I'd say they're definitely a match. Who do they belong to?  ",2,12
SCULLY: That name sounds familiar.  ,2,12
SCULLY: What's your interest in this case?  ,2,12
SCULLY: Believing in the paranormal?  ,2,12
SCULLY: Which is?  ,2,12
SCULLY: I guess that's why we're going to Aubrey.  ,2,12
"SCULLY: Detective Morrow, exactly how did you discover the remains?  ",2,12
SCULLY: These bones are in good condition. But I think the field may have been tilled shortly after Chaney was buried; there are small cuts on the top three ribs. I don't think they were made by an animal.  ,2,12
"SCULLY: Well, that's poetic but it doesn't help us much. What did he say about the 1942 homicides?  ",2,12
"SCULLY: Mulder, these cuts on the ribs -- they could have been made by a razor.  ",2,12
"SCULLY: No, but we might be able to if we can find somebody in Aubrey who has a digital scanner.  ",2,12
SCULLY: I've scanned the images from the crime photo and the ribcage and loaded them to Quantico. It's gonna be a few more seconds before the hookup.  ,2,12
"SCULLY: Mulder, I don't think BJ was in the woods that night because of engine failure.  ",2,12
"SCULLY: Well, the Motel Black would have been the perfect meeting place -- away from town, away from his wife ...  ",2,12
SCULLY: It's obvious BJ and Tillman are having an affair.  ,2,12
SCULLY: A woman senses these things.  ,2,12
"SCULLY: The image on the right is Chaney's ribcage. The one on the left was extrapolated from the crime photo of the Slash Killer's last victim. Now I need to enlarge the victim's ribcage in order to allow for gender difference. (Taps busily on keyboard.) And now, we can compare them. (Computer beeps and reads, ""ATTEMPT MATCH IMAGE COMPARE NO MATCH"".)  ",2,12
SCULLY: I'm searching for any matching pattern of cuts.  ,2,12
SCULLY: Feeling better?  ,2,12
SCULLY: Things must be difficult for you now. I've had ... feelings for people I've worked with. Interoffice relationships can be complicated ... especially when he's married.  ,2,12
"SCULLY: (with penetrating insight and feminine intuition) You're pregnant, aren't you?  ",2,12
"SCULLY: No, not yet.  ",2,12
SCULLY: (returning to BJ) Nightmares?  ,2,12
SCULLY: Have you talked to anyone about these nightmares?  ,2,12
SCULLY: What are you going to do?  ,2,12
"SCULLY: (with only a slight touch of ""I told you so"") Well, BJ's pregnant, and Tillman's the father.  ",2,12
"SCULLY: Well, it could be a word, or it could just be random slashes.  ",2,12
"SCULLY: Well, that means getting a court order. It could take a couple of days. Maybe we could find a relative who could speed up the process.  ",2,12
"SCULLY: No, those were from a case that Agent Ledbetter and Agent Chaney were investigating in 1942 before they disappeared.  ",2,12
SCULLY: BJ?  ,2,12
SCULLY: What do you think it is?  ,2,12
SCULLY: Do you know why they might have been in your dream?  ,2,12
SCULLY: (v/o) This is the man BJ claims to have seen in her dream.  ,2,12
"SCULLY: (v/o) Harry Cokely. He lives in Gainesville, Nebraska since his release from Macalester Penitentiary on December fifth, 1993.  ",2,12
"SCULLY: He was convicted in 1945 for rape and attempted murder. Cokely carved ""SISTER"" on the chest of his victim, Linda Thibedeaux, before she was able to escape and get help from a neighbor.  ",2,12
SCULLY: No.  ,2,12
"SCULLY: But Mulder, the man we're talking about is 77 years old.  ",2,12
SCULLY: What if it's cryptamnesia?  ,2,12
SCULLY: Yeah. BJ told us that her father was a policeman in the area. What if she heard him discussing the 1942 case when she was young? She might have even seen pictures of Cokely .  ,2,12
SCULLY: What if the recent murders triggered what was previously buried in her mind ... some connection she'd unconsciously made that no one else had been able to make.  ,2,12
"SCULLY: Yeah, something like that.  ",2,12
SCULLY: I seem to recall you having some pretty extreme hunches.  ,2,12
"SCULLY: Mr. Cokely, our records show that in 1942, you lived in Terrence, Nebraska, an hour's drive away from Aubrey, Missouri. During that time, three women were murdered in Aubrey. (COKELY is coughing hoarsely.) Their assailant had mutilated their bodies with a razor in the same manner that you slashed Mrs. Linda Thibedeaux's body in 1945.  ",2,12
"SCULLY: Well, I'm sure Mrs. Thibedeaux will never forget it.  ",2,12
SCULLY: What kind of pills?  ,2,12
SCULLY: (interrupting him) That won't be necessary.  ,2,12
SCULLY: For now. (if looks could kill ... )  ,2,12
SCULLY: Thought you might need these.  ,2,12
SCULLY: You hurt yourself.  ,2,12
SCULLY: Cokely attacked you?  ,2,12
"SCULLY: Well, I'll have Tillman pick him up. (Looks at MULDER with a ""let's humor her"" look.)  ",2,12
SCULLY: (outside) Mulder?  ,2,12
"SCULLY: I have the preliminary results from the genetic testing from the blood found under Verna Johnson's nails. They checked it against Cokely's. The PGM subtype matches, the DQF and the D-1S are the same.  ",2,12
SCULLY: The results strongly suggest that. Imagine the strength of this man's psychosis still driving him to murder after fifty years.  ,2,12
"SCULLY: Well, she's not the first. Mrs. Thibedeaux also survived his attack back in 1945.  ",2,12
"SCULLY: I know this goes back a long way, Mrs. Thibedeaux, but can you tell us what happened the night Harry Cokely attacked you?  ",2,12
"SCULLY: The bones BJ found under the house belong to Chaney's partner, Agent Ledbetter. Cokely rented the house in 1942. The detectives at the crime scene found an old straight razor under the house, they're trying to lift some prints. And Cokely's been released, but I think we have enough to nail him.  ",2,12
"SCULLY: Yeah, but you know the state of mind she was in that night. She, she could have been mistaken.  ",2,12
SCULLY: Are you saying Cokely's grandson attacked BJ?  ,2,12
SCULLY: (dialing a phone number) I don't think Mendel had serial killers in mind when he developed his theory on genetics.  ,2,12
SCULLY: What?  ,2,12
"SCULLY: (on the phone) Yeah, Danny Valladeo, it's Agent Scully. (to MULDER) What does that have to do with Cokely?  ",2,12
SCULLY: But children aren't born liking sunflower seeds. Environments shape them; behavior patterns are taught.  ,2,12
SCULLY: Waldo?  ,2,12
"SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah, Danny. (pause as she listens, then shock spreads across her face) Yeah, thanks, I'll tell him. (hangs up the phone) Danny tracked down Mrs. Thibedeaux's son. He was a policeman named Raymond Morrow.  ",2,12
SCULLY: BJ is Cokely's granddaughter.  ,2,12
SCULLY: Mulder ...  ,2,12
"SCULLY: Wait, Mulder. Do you honestly think that BJ is capable of murder?  ",2,12
SCULLY: That's outrageous!  ,2,12
"SCULLY: So you're saying that BJ's nightmares are real? That, that she's out there killing these women and carving ""SISTER"" on them?  ",2,12
SCULLY: Well then how do you explain the cuts on her own chest?  ,2,12
SCULLY: Where are we going?  ,2,12
"SCULLY: Mulder. (She rushes up the stairs to the landing, where MRS. THIBEDEAUX is slumped against the wall, holding a hand over her chest. She appears unhurt.) Mrs. Thibedeaux. What happened?  ",2,12
SCULLY: Can you stand?  ,2,12
SCULLY: Let me help you up the steps.  ,2,12
SCULLY: BJ's going after Tillman. The first murder occurred after BJ found out she was pregnant. She's looking for someone to blame. I think that's Tillman.  ,2,12
SCULLY: Why?  ,2,12
SCULLY: I'm giving a statement.  ,2,12
SCULLY: Can we talk about this outside?  ,2,12
SCULLY: Have you seen Detective Morrow?  ,2,12
SCULLY: (gesturing to MRS. THIBEDEAUX) Detective Morrow broke into this woman's house and attacked her with a razor.  ,2,12
SCULLY: Freeze! (Audibly she cocks her weapon; she's got BJ covered.)  ,2,12
"SCULLY: Let him go. Let him go, BJ.  ",2,12
SCULLY: He's dead.  ,2,12
"SCULLY: (v/o) We are continuing with genetic testing on Detective Morrow. Evidence suggests the presence of a mutator gene that has activated previously dormant genes, but the results so far are inconclusive.  ",2,12
SCULLY: (v/o) Detective Morrow has not demonstrated any further physiological changes. Extensive blood work and psychological testing has been conducted in order to determine whether the pregnancy could have been a catalyst for the transformation. We have yet to determine the effects on the fetus.  ,2,12
"SCULLY: (v/o) Amniocentesis results show no genetic abnormalities. Chromosome testing has determined the child's sex to be male. BJ is on her second week of suicide watch after an unsuccessful attempt to abort her son. Lieutenant Tillman has petitioned to adopt the child, and the case will soon be presented to the courts.  ",2,12
"SCULLY: Yeah... I've read about cases of desecrating the dead, but this is the first time I've seen one. ",2,13
SCULLY: Why do they do it? ,2,13
"SCULLY (looks curiously at Mulder): Sometimes you surprise me, Mulder. ",2,13
SCULLY: How that didn't shock you back there. ,2,13
"SCULLY (gives him a look, they are in the car now): You knew it wasn't UFO related from the start? ",2,13
"SCULLY: Mulder, we flew three hours to get here. Our plane doesn't leave until tomorrow night. If you suspected, why - ",2,13
SCULLY: Did you get your forensics report on this one? ,2,13
"SCULLY: I'll be right with you. (Mulder ducks back, while Scully remains there, shaken).  ",2,13
"SCULLY'S VOICE OVER: A complete model or psychological profile of the death fetishist does not exist. Extrapolating from material on file at the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit, the compulsion is the result of a complex misplacement of values and a deviation from cultural norms and societal mores - often accompanied by extreme alienation from normal social interaction and traditional avenues for interaction with others. He is more likely to be white, male and of average to above average intelligence. Cases of fetishists with IQs over 150 have been documented. The progression of the pathology can be traced from the fantasy stage to the eventual acting out of fetishistic impulses, including opportunistic homicide. Agent Mulder believes strongly that the suspect in this case is escalating toward this action. It is my opinion from reading these case files that death fetishism may play a stronger role than suspected in cases of serial murder. That once he begins to murder, it is the killing that draws attention away from a deeper motive. A motive which most people, including law enforcement professionals, dare not imagine. It is somehow easier to believe, as Agent Bocks does, in aliens and UFOs, than in the kind of cold blooded inhuman monster who could prey on the living to scavenge from the dead.  ",2,13
SCULLY: I need a minute.  ,2,13
"SCULLY'S VOICE OVER: Death is a recorded event. For reasons natural or unnatural, when a body ceases to function, the cause of the effect can be clearly reconstructed. A body has a story to tell.  ",2,13
"SCULLY: The time is eleven fourteen AM, Monday, November 14th. The deceased is a female in her twenties... (her voice fades)  ",2,13
"SCULLY'S VOICE OVER: If the victim was strangled, an examination of the veins in the eyes will reveal this. If the victim was shot, entry wounds and gunpowder residue can be used to reconstruct the events leading to death and help to establish a possible motive. Body temperature, preferably the temperature of the spleen, is an accurate indicator of the time of death. As are rigor, livor and levels of sodium in the blood. If the body was moved, sand, small rocks, vegetable debris, even pollen can be removed and analysed to determine the location of the original crime scene and place the position of the body at the time of death. Extracutenous stains and residues can indicate the use of poison or toxins. Hair and fibres, slivers of glass, plastic, even insect casings can serve to recreate the circumstances under which death occurred.  ",2,13
"SCULLY'S VOICE OVER: It may be an irony only understood by those of us who conduct these examinations, who use these pieces to rebuild a narrative, that death, like life itself, is a drama with a beginning, middle and end. It is my opinion, having conducted this examination, that the victim died a wrongful death for the express purpose of extracting her hair and fingernails.  ",2,13
"SCULLY'S VOICE OVER: The time of death cannot be accurately determined due to what I believe must have been immersion in a cold environment, most likely water. Death came as a result of blood loss and trauma from a deep knife wound which severed the plimonary artery. Of the evidence examined, no one piece or combination gives a clear picture of the killer, other than the motive implied by the bizarre nature if the crime. For the record, it is also my opinion that, outside of child homicide, which may be more tragic and heinous, this is one of the most angry and dehumanizing murders imaginable.  ",2,13
SCULLY: Hello. ,2,13
"SCULLY: Mulder, can I have a minute with you? ",2,13
SCULLY: I think I might better drive this investigation if I focused on the evidence. ,2,13
"SCULLY: That I take the body back to Washington. I'd like to run it through the fingerprint lab there. You know those guys, they can pull a print - ",2,13
"SCULLY: I'm not having trouble, Mulder. ",2,13
"SCULLY: I'm fine with it. Really. I just think we're a long way from catching this guy. If we could get a print, we'd have something to go on. Right now we're at a standstill. ",2,13
SCULLY: The body was shipped on my flight. I should be here within the hour. ,2,13
SCULLY: I've got a flight back to Minneapolis booked for tonight. But I might cancel. ,2,13
"SCULLY: You think you find a way to deal with these things. In med school, you develop a clinical detachment to death. In your FBI training, you are confronted with cases, the most terrible and violent cases. You think you can look into the face of pure evil. And then you find yourself paralysed by it. ",2,13
SCULLY: No. Was I? ,2,13
SCULLY: Probably as another way of trying to detach myself from it. ,2,13
SCULLY: No. ,2,13
"SCULLY: No. (pauses) I know it sounds crazy, but I don't want him to know how much this is bothering me. I don't want him to think he has to protect me. ",2,13
"SCULLY (tears well up in her eyes, but she's not crying): I know these things. I'm conscious of them. I know the world is full of predators, just as it has always been. And I know it's my job to protect people from them. And I've counted on that fact to give me faith in my ability to do what I do... I want that faith back... I need it back.  ",2,13
SCULLY: I had a meeting. ,2,13
SCULLY: What did you find? ,2,13
SCULLY (excited): I've got to call Agent Mulder. (goes to the phone) ,2,13
SCULLY: Who? ,2,13
SCULLY: Did you tell him about the print? ,2,13
"SCULLY: Hi, it's me. We got a print. ",2,13
SCULLY: No. I'm coming back tonight. ,2,13
"SCULLY: I'm okay with it, Mulder. You can use my help. ",2,13
SCULLY: I'm okay. ,2,13
"SCULLY (she insists on getting up, Mulder helps her): I'm fine. Just help me get my wrists undone. ",2,13
"SCULLY (quietly): Mulder, I'm fine.  ",2,13
SCULLY: Couldn't have been dead for more than 12 hours.  ,2,14
"SCULLY: (polite disbelief) Any evidence to substantiate those rumours, Sheriff Oakes?  ",2,14
SCULLY: Many homicides include victim desecration.  ,2,14
SCULLY: More rumours.  ,2,14
SCULLY: Any idea who Jerry Stevens was with out here?  ,2,14
"SCULLY: Well, most people don't set out to drink two six-packs by themselves. (Mulder nods) I also found this (Holds up page). It has some purple ink on the edge, like a library identification stamp... (CU On page: it's torn and crumpled. We see the end of a title, ""in America"", on the top, and underneath some words recognisable from the incantation.) ...and the end of the title says ""In America"". I'm surprised your people overlooked it.  ",2,14
SCULLY: Theories like that are why I can't take him seriously.  ,2,14
"SCULLY: Mulder, I got the impression you didn't believe him either.  ",2,14
SCULLY: I think he incited your imagination. I think this case is nothing more than a murderer taking advantage of local folklore. I mean there's nothing odd about -  ,2,14
"SCULLY: Mulder, toads just fell from the sky! (Looks at him, taken aback)  ",2,14
"SCULLY: The National Weather Service says there are tornadoes in Northern Massachusetts. The wind probably picked up the animals into the storm. (Doesn't look totally convinced, despite her words).  ",2,14
SCULLY: Last checked out to a Dave Duran.  ,2,14
"SCULLY: ...FBI, we'd like to speak with a Dave Duran...  ",2,14
SCULLY: What made you go to a place you heard was a witches' altar?  ,2,14
SCULLY: Why did you take the book?  ,2,14
SCULLY: You never thought what?  ,2,14
SCULLY: (Can't believe what she's hearing) The FBI recently concluded a seven-year study and found little or no evidence of the existence of occult conspiracies.  ,2,14
"SCULLY: (Voice rising a little, a bit exasperated but staying reasonable) Look, if the number of murders attributed to occult conspiracies were true, it would mean thousands of people killing tens of thousands of people a year, without evidence, without being exposed... it would be the greatest criminal conspiracy in the history of civilisation.  ",2,14
"SCULLY: (Exasperated) Mulder, this is mass hysteria. And our presence here on a routine homicide only gives validity to their fears of occult murder.  ",2,14
SCULLY: What's wrong with it?  ,2,14
SCULLY: That isn't possible.  ,2,14
SCULLY: Maybe there's nothing here.  ,2,14
"SCULLY: Take a look at this. (Mulder steps round to look at the screen) I found this on the Internet (Points, runs finger along screen as she speaks. cut to cu of screen: item under newsbytes: current events. Text is dated 1934. Scully reads item as we see it, we cut back to her about halfway through.  ",2,14
"SCULLY READS:) ""The discovery yesterday of a mutilated teenaged boy in the forest has police officials distressed about the possibility of a conspiratorial organization of Dark Forces.""  ",2,14
"SCULLY: (Reading) ""The Jew is known to remove organs and sacrifice teens in their religious ceremonies"". (To Mulder) It's taken from ""Volkischer Beobacter"", a Nazi newspaper in 1934. The rumours are the same, but the blanks have been filled in with whoever must be feared or persecuted at the time. In this case, it's occultists.  ",2,14
"SCULLY: Well, if not witches, then what?  ",2,14
SCULLY: Others?  ,2,14
SCULLY: Why don't we just wait and see what her parents have to say?  ,2,14
"SCULLY: She wanted to remain with friends. And... under the circumstances, we thought it best.  ",2,14
"SCULLY: Mrs Ausbury? Er, perhaps you'd like a glass of water.  ",2,14
SCULLY: Mrs Ausbury... your daughter has not accused you of any involvement in these activities. (MRS AUSBURY SHAKES HER HEAD SLIGHTLY) Do you have any idea why Shannon might have said these things?  ,2,14
SCULLY: Have you ever known Shannon to be pregnant?  ,2,14
SCULLY: Have you ever had another child?  ,2,14
SCULLY: At eight years old?  ,2,14
SCULLY SIGHS.  ,2,14
"SCULLY: Did you see anybody leaving the room? (Mulder looks over at her again, then walks towards her office. Paddock doesn't notice; she shakes her head in response to Sscully's questioning) Did you hear the door open?  ",2,14
SCULLY: (TO PADDOCK) Excuse me...  ,2,14
SCULLY: She says it's to block the smell of formaldehyde.  ,2,14
"SCULLY: Well, I've got to admit there are some oddities to her story.  ",2,14
"SCULLY: Well, the man she replaced has taken two sick days in a fifteen-year career. The morning of Jerry Stevens' murder Mr Kingary (???) developed necrotizing fasciitis.  ",2,14
"SCULLY: I know. And when I questioned the other staff members about Mrs Paddock's background, no-one can even recall hiring her. (Big lightning crash. They both look up, startled, then back at each other. Cut to Paddock staring over at them. She turns back to look at the bench in front of her, slowly focusing on Scully's pen) Oh, look, I'm even getting caught up in this. I mean I'm... I'm sure that Mrs Paddock's arrival and the teacher's sickness is just a coincidence. And the fact that no-one can recall hiring her -- it's just a bureaucratic oversight.  ",2,14
SCULLY: (TO HERSELF) Clean.  ,2,14
SCULLY: Mulder... the school... I'm in trouble.  ,2,14
"SCULLY: (LOOKS UP, STARTLED) Mulder! What's wrong?  ",2,14
"SCULLY: No, I didn't touch the phone. (MULDER LOOKS BEMUSED.)  ",2,14
SCULLY: I checked on Mrs Paddock's background. I don't think she's involved.  ,2,14
SCULLY: My God. (FASCINATED) You think that's some kind of acid?  ,2,14
"SCULLY: (BRUSHING HAIR BACK, DISBELIEF) That's impossible! It would take a large python hours to consume and weeks to digest a human being.  ",2,14
SCULLY: (PAUSES BRIEFLY) There's a python in Paddock's room.  ,2,14
"SCULLY: Mulder. (Paddock is lying on the floor next to the bench with the snake's tank on it. The tank is broken and empty. Scully crosses to her, Mulder follows. They both crouch down) Mrs Paddock? What happened?  ",2,14
SCULLY: Just stay still. We'll be back.  ,2,14
"SCULLY: Oh God... Mulder, did you see his face? (HE NODS, SHE CAN'T SEE HIM) It was as if something else had control of him.  ",2,14
"SCULLY: Mrs Paddock? (Mulder walks to where they left her. There is no sign of her, only their coats) Mulder.  ",2,14
"SCULLY: (reading) Drug and alcohol tests came back negative. Car shows no evidence of brake, steering or any other mechanical failure.  ",2,15
SCULLY: Both at the same base?  ,2,15
SCULLY: Wasn't there a riot there about a month ago?  ,2,15
SCULLY: Why did the military contact us?  ,2,15
SCULLY: She doesnt believe it was suicide.  ,2,15
SCULLY: It looks like some kind of ritual symbol.  ,2,15
SCULLY: Mrs. McAlpin believes voodoo was behind her husband's death?  ,2,15
SCULLY: Did he ever discuss with you what went on there? What his duties included?  ,2,15
SCULLY: Was he ever treated for depression or stress?  ,2,15
"SCULLY: (ignoring him) Come on, Mulder.  ",2,15
"SCULLY: (over it) Lets go, Mulder.  ",2,15
SCULLY: Two of your men have died in the past two weeks allegedly of self-inflicted injuries.  ,2,15
SCULLY: But your soldiers aren't in combat.  ,2,15
SCULLY: How so?  ,2,15
SCULLY: So your men are getting the brunt of the refugees' frustration?  ,2,15
SCULLY: I'd also like to examine Private McAlpin's body. I have a signed consent from his wife.  ,2,15
SCULLY: So they pronounced him at the scene?  ,2,15
"SCULLY: Mulder, I need to speak with you.  ",2,15
SCULLY: How did you know?  ,2,15
SCULLY: Somebody stole McAlpin's body and replaced it with what looks like a dog's corpse.  ,2,15
"SCULLY: Somehow, Bauvais must have switched the bodies.  ",2,15
"SCULLY: Well, then he had somebody else do it.  ",2,15
SCULLY: I was only suggesting that whoever did it was clever and thorough. I wasnt suggesting that some kind of spirit did it.  ,2,15
"SCULLY: Mulder, voodoo only works by instilling fear in its believers. You saw how Bauvais tried to intimidate me. I'll admit the power of suggestion is considerable but this is no more magic than a pair of fuzzy dice.  ",2,15
SCULLY: Private McAlpin?  ,2,15
"SCULLY: Hes nonverbal, nonresponsive to voice, touch or pain. The neurologists suspect he suffered a severe concussion resulting in amnesia.  ",2,15
"SCULLY: Well, obviously, he never left. Dr. Foyle made a gross mistake when he signed the death certificate. Its not the first time something like thats happened.  ",2,15
"SCULLY: Yeah. (reads) Electrolytes, white and red counts are all normal. Except this is strange. The lab detected trace levels of tetrodotoxin in his blood. (MULDER begins pacing.) That's a poison found in the liver and reproductive organs of puffer fish-- a Japanese delicacy.  ",2,15
SCULLY: You have a theory how it got into his blood?  ,2,15
"SCULLY: Well, I hope you don't intend to tell Robin McAlpin that she married one?  ",2,15
"SCULLY: But, Mulder, its a lethal poison.  ",2,15
"SCULLY: Well, zombie or not, Jack McAlpin is alive.  ",2,15
SCULLY: Why did they bury Private Guttierez here?  ,2,15
SCULLY: Too late?  ,2,15
SCULLY: Don't the police intervene?  ,2,15
SCULLY: Mulder ..  ,2,15
SCULLY: (looking at the frogs) Maybe I should kiss a few and find out if one is Guttierez.  ,2,15
SCULLY: How do you get out of the camp?  ,2,15
SCULLY: What about your parents? Are your parents at the camp?  ,2,15
"SCULLY: Mulder, certain frog species secrete a substance called bufotoxin. It's chemically similar to what we found in Private McAlpins blood. I think we should ask Bauvais what he's doing with those frogs.  ",2,15
SCULLY: (approaching the men) Whats going on?  ,2,15
SCULLY: Colonel Wharton sanctioned beatings of the refugees?  ,2,15
SCULLY: Why hasn't anybody stepped forward or filed a complaint?  ,2,15
"SCULLY: Well, we don't know what happened to him but there is a medical explanation for his condition.  ",2,15
SCULLY: Sounds like an old wives tale.  ,2,15
SCULLY: Think hes telling the truth?  ,2,15
"SCULLY: Hes superstitious, and superstition breeds fear. Its what Voodoo is all about. Its just as irrational as avoiding a crack in the sidewalk.  ",2,15
SCULLY: We suspect it was an act of retaliation.  ,2,15
SCULLY: For your mistreatment of the detainees.  ,2,15
SCULLY: Physical abuse of political refugees is a prosecutable crime under international law.  ,2,15
SCULLY: Then there is no official policy of harassment?  ,2,15
"SCULLY: Sorry, Mulder, theres a big difference between nasty looks and raising the dead.  ",2,15
SCULLY: Ah!!!  ,2,15
SCULLY: More scare tactics. (tosses vine out the window)  ,2,15
SCULLY: No. Its nothing.  ,2,15
SCULLY: (on phone) You don't understand. I've been on hold for half an hour. I'm trying to locate a Private Dunham.  ,2,15
SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah. Yeah. Thanks.  ,2,15
"SCULLY: (through door) Mulder, I just got through to Dunhams barracks. Mulder? Your door's unlocked.  ",2,15
"SCULLY: Mulder, listen to this. Dunham's been AWOL since last night...  ",2,15
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,2,15
"SCULLY: Oh, God.  ",2,15
SCULLY: (relieved) Yeah.  ,2,15
SCULLY: Yeah. It's Dunham.  ,2,15
SCULLY: Why did you sign the confession?  ,2,15
SCULLY: (holding her head) I'm fine. It's just a headache.  ,2,15
SCULLY: He said it himself. He signed a confession.  ,2,15
SCULLY: (looking at picture) Thats Bauvais. And Wharton? They must have known each other when Wharton served in Haiti.  ,2,15
"SCULLY: Mulder  Dunham and Guttierez both filed complaints against Colonel Wharton. They both cited incidents of abuse --- dates, times   ",2,15
SCULLY: It wasnt Bauvais.  ,2,15
SCULLY: Those men were about to testify against Colonel Wharton. He stopped them before they did.  ,2,15
SCULLY: Im all right.  ,2,15
"SCULLY: No, Im fine. Ill catch up with you. Just go get Wharton.  ",2,15
SCULLY: (breathing heavily) Mulder   ,2,15
SCULLY: I feel better than you look.  ,2,15
SCULLY: What happened?  ,2,15
SCULLY: Hes dead. Did you kill him?  ,2,15
SCULLY: Thank you.  ,2,15
SCULLY: Is this a complete list?  ,2,15
SCULLY: There was a boy. His name was Bonaparte. Chester Bonaparte?  ,2,15
SCULLY: An Agent Mulder was brought here tonight?  ,2,16
SCULLY: I'm a federal agent!  ,2,16
SCULLY: There's no time for this.  ,2,16
"SCULLY: I'm Dana Scully, I'm Agent Mulder's partner. What are his vitals?  ",2,16
SCULLY: No... you've got to get him out of the tub.  ,2,16
"SCULLY: You've got to listen to me! If you keep him in there, you're going to kill him! The cold is the only thing that's keeping him alive.  ",2,16
SCULLY: I was just down the street. Someone fired more shots at the White House last night.  ,2,16
SCULLY: What are you working on?  ,2,16
SCULLY: Sent by whom?  ,2,16
SCULLY: Why?  ,2,16
SCULLY: Sounds like the work of militant right-to-lifers.  ,2,16
SCULLY: Why would somebody send them to you?  ,2,16
SCULLY: What did you find?  ,2,16
SCULLY: Triplets?  ,2,16
SCULLY: What?  ,2,16
"SCULLY: What about the man you arrested, this, uh, preacher?  ",2,16
SCULLY: Would you recognize his face?  ,2,16
"SCULLY: I've got a bad feeling about this case, Mulder.  ",2,16
"SCULLY: Well, nothing about it makes sense. We've got three deaths of identical victims, no bodies, a virtual non-suspect...  ",2,16
"SCULLY: You don't even know who sent you that information. I mean, we've been set up before.  ",2,16
SCULLY: More victims?  ,2,16
SCULLY: There's twenty four messages responding to the ad. The first caller has seen the man in the photo in Syracuse.  ,2,16
"SCULLY: Mulder, it's me.  ",2,16
SCULLY: I'm at home.  ,2,16
SCULLY: What?  ,2,16
"SCULLY: Have you checked your e-mail this morning, Mulder?  ",2,16
SCULLY: Because I received something unsettling and I wondered if you'd gotten it too.  ,2,16
"SCULLY: It's a digitally scanned photograph. There's another one, Mulder.  ",2,16
SCULLY: He's right here in Washington.  ,2,16
SCULLY: Who are they?  ,2,16
SCULLY: Are you saying these men are clones?  ,2,16
"SCULLY: If you've known about this for a year, why hasn't anything been done?  ",2,16
SCULLY: Who?  ,2,16
"SCULLY: Agents Scully and Mulder, we're with the F.B.I.  ",2,16
"SCULLY: May we come in, Doctor Dickens?  ",2,16
SCULLY: I'll call the paramedics...  ,2,16
SCULLY: I'll call you back.  ,2,16
SCULLY: Okay...  ,2,16
SCULLY: Where?  ,2,16
SCULLY: How are you feeling?  ,2,16
SCULLY: Maybe we should've dropped this case when you were told.  ,2,16
"SCULLY: Our friend from the C.I.A. is about as unbelievable as his story... as is everything about this case. I mean, whatever happened to ""trust no one,"" Mulder?  ",2,16
"SCULLY: Why would a man with his experience need our help... and how could he let a man that he's been looking so hard for slip away so easily? You know, that doctor wasn't running away from us, Mulder, he was running away from Agent Chapel.  ",2,16
SCULLY: Paranoid. Have you stopped to consider that maybe it was Agent Chapel who killed that field agent in Syracuse?  ,2,16
"SCULLY: Damn it, Mulder, that is not my job.  ",2,16
SCULLY: An F.B.I. agent died because of our pursuit of this case.  ,2,16
SCULLY: I have to show you something.  ,2,16
SCULLY: An autopsy bay?  ,2,16
"SCULLY: There's no penetrating knife or gunshot wounds. No ligature marks or abrasions from strangulation. The toxicologocial is clean... and the blood work... well, the blood work is strange.  ",2,16
"SCULLY: Well, there's evidence of polycythemia, excessive production of red blood cells.  ",2,16
SCULLY: Extremely. The doctor who made this report has it in here that the blood was curdled like jelly. As if something caused the blood to thicken or clot prior to death.  ,2,16
"SCULLY: Possibly a coagulating agent introduced into the body, but it would've shown up on the toxicological.  ",2,16
"SCULLY: I don't know, Mulder, I... there was a doctor's bag I took as evidence from the apartment.  ",2,16
"SCULLY: Well, Skinner's going to want to know why you didn't file your report. What're you going to say?  ",2,16
SCULLY: I didn't find anything much to go on but we've got an address.  ,2,16
SCULLY: Where you going?  ,2,16
"SCULLY: Mulder, it's me. I need to talk to you immediately. I've got some new information on this case.  ",2,16
"SCULLY ON MACHINE: Hi, this is Dana Scully.  ",2,16
"SCULLY ON MACHINE: Please, leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.  ",2,16
"SCULLY: Mulder, it's me. I just left my aparment and I don't think I've been followed. I'm going to be staying at the Vacation Village Motor Lodge off the I-90 in Germantown. Now, by the time you reach me, I should have some very important information for you regarding this case.  ",2,16
SCULLY: Wait.  ,2,16
SCULLY: Put you hands against the wall... now.  ,2,16
SCULLY: Sir...  ,2,16
"SCULLY: These men are to be held in maximum security protective custody. No visitors, no press, no anybody... okay?  ",2,16
SCULLY: I'll let you know when I figure it out myself.  ,2,16
SCULLY ON MACHINE: ...I should have some very important information for you regarding this case.  ,2,16
"SCULLY: I'd like a single for one night, please.  ",2,16
SCULLY: Who is it?  ,2,16
SCULLY: Where've you been?  ,2,16
"SCULLY: No, sorry.  ",2,17
"SCULLY: It's a wrong number. Where have you been, Mulder? I've been trying to get a hold of you.  ",2,17
SCULLY: Why didn't you call when you got my message?  ,2,17
SCULLY: Put your hands against the wall.  ,2,17
SCULLY: I said put your hands against the wall!  ,2,17
SCULLY: Do it!  ,2,17
SCULLY: I don't know who you are.  ,2,17
SCULLY: I said keep your hands up.  ,2,17
SCULLY: I don't know what you're talking about.  ,2,17
"SCULLY: Mulder, it's me.  ",2,17
"SCULLY: I don't know, I'm... I'm in a telephone booth.  ",2,17
SCULLY: A woman who's with you. He says you'll know what I'm talking about.  ,2,17
SCULLY: He doesn't want to negotiate. He says he wants to make a trade.  ,2,17
SCULLY: He wants you to be at Memorial Bridge at Bethesda in one hour.  ,2,17
SCULLY: Mulder...  ,2,17
SCULLY: Yeah.  ,2,17
SCULLY: I'm okay.  ,2,17
SCULLY: Mulder...  ,2,17
SCULLY: I was discharged an hour ago and I asked to come here. Have they found anything yet?  ,2,17
SCULLY: Maybe... but the water's thirty-six degrees.  ,2,17
"SCULLY: Mulder, why didn't you tell me on the phone that it was her?  ",2,17
SCULLY: Why not?  ,2,17
SCULLY: Are you sure that it's your sister?  ,2,17
"SCULLY: Because back at the motel, Mulder, it was you but, but it wasn't you.  ",2,17
"SCULLY: Well, then who is this man and what does he...  ",2,17
SCULLY: Is that what you're going to tell Skinner?  ,2,17
"SCULLY: Mulder, it's me.  ",2,17
"SCULLY: Mulder, I think you should come back as soon as you can.  ",2,17
SCULLY: It's your sister.  ,2,17
SCULLY: Yeah.  ,2,17
"SCULLY: No, not yet.  ",2,17
SCULLY: What is it?  ,2,17
"SCULLY: After being treated for smoke inhalation, Agent Mulder was released from Samaritan Hospital in satisfactory condition. At his request, the abortion clinic where he was found has been searched repeatedly but the bodies of the women he insists perished there were not found. My report on this case remains incomplete. Many aspects continue to defy explanation including the identities of the identical men and women. Agent Mulder's claim of alien origins cannot be substantiated. The man suspected in their disappearances is still at large...  ",2,17
"SCULLY: ...and has now been charged with the death of F.B.I. Special Agent Barret Weiss, whose body has been quarantined at the U.S. Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. Weiss' cause of death involved a thickening of the blood. It is now believed that he was subjected to a virulent strain of virus whose origin and behavior are also unexplainable.  ",2,17
SCULLY: Was the thickening of Agent Weiss' blood an immunological response to the virus?  ,2,17
SCULLY: What did you do to it?  ,2,17
SCULLY: So the virus is inhibited by cold.  ,2,17
"SCULLY: We pulled a body from the river yesterday that was chilled near freezing. When it started to thaw, it began to corrode.  ",2,17
"SCULLY: If you find out anything else, you let me know as soon as possible.  ",2,17
"SCULLY: Mulder, it's me, are you there?  ",2,17
SCULLY: Sir?  ,2,17
"SCULLY: May we speak off the record, sir?  ",2,17
SCULLY: Agent Mulder.  ,2,17
"SCULLY: I don't know, I was hoping that you could tell me or help me to find out.  ",2,17
"SCULLY: He told me the same thing but I don't think this matter with his sister is settled. Sir, is there any way that you can reach him through unofficial channels?  ",2,17
SCULLY: Please?  ,2,17
SCULLY: Agent Mulder has saved my life!  ,2,17
SCULLY: Where is Mulder?  ,2,17
"SCULLY: Where's Mulder? I need to know, damn it!  ",2,17
SCULLY: I'm losing time!  ,2,17
SCULLY: How did you get this?  ,2,17
"SCULLY: I'm Dana Scully, I'm Agent Mulder's partner. What are his vitals?  ",2,17
SCULLY: No... you've got to get him out of the tub.  ,2,17
"SCULLY: You've got to listen to me! If you keep him in there, you're going to kill him! The cold is the only thing that's keeping him alive.  ",2,17
SCULLY: You don't know what you're dealing with here! Agent Mulder has been exposed to a retrovirus resulting in hyperviscosity syndrome.  ,2,17
SCULLY: His blood has thickened...  ,2,17
SCULLY: That's why his heart is failing!  ,2,17
"SCULLY: No, the only thing saving him right now is the hypermetabolic state induced by the cold. Now, if you don't do what I'm saying, you are going to kill him!  ",2,17
SCULLY: Clear!  ,2,17
SCULLY: Clear!  ,2,17
"SCULLY: I want a digoxin 0.1 milligram I.V. Hang a heparin drip at 1,000 units per hour. And get him two units of fresh frozen plasma now.  ",2,17
SCULLY: He's going to make it.  ,2,17
SCULLY: Transfusions and an aggressive treatment with anti-viral agents have resulted in a steady but gradual improvement in Agent Mulder's condition. Blood tests have confirmed his exposure to the still unidentified retrovirus whose origin remains a mystery. The search team that found Agent Mulder has located neither the missing submarine nor the man he was looking for. ,2,17
SCULLY: A naval reconnaissance squad found and choppered you to Eisenhower Field.  ,2,17
SCULLY: Did you find what you were looking for?  ,2,17
SCULLY: So you saw nothing when the window broke? No one outside?  ,2,18
SCULLY: Okay. Thank you.  ,2,18
SCULLY: They claim they didn't see anything.  ,2,18
SCULLY: What the janitors describe sounds more like a sonic boom.  ,2,18
"SCULLY: Mulder, if you're still suggesting that the elephant did this, it just defies logic. Somebody would have seen it.  ",2,18
SCULLY: An invisible elephant?  ,2,18
SCULLY: Have they determined what he died of?  ,2,18
SCULLY: Ambrose?  ,2,18
"SCULLY: What're you looking for, Mulder?  ",2,18
SCULLY: Excuse me. We're looking for Willa Ambrose.  ,2,18
SCULLY: Thank you.  ,2,18
SCULLY: Miss Ambrose?  ,2,18
SCULLY: I'm Agent Dana Scully. (flashes her badge) This is Agent Mulder. We're with the FBI.  ,2,18
"SCULLY: Well, a federal employee was fatally injured last night, and there seems to be a case developing around the elephant that escaped from your zoo.  ",2,18
"SCULLY: No, I was just wondering why such a small pen for such a large animal.  ",2,18
SCULLY: Would he be vindictive enough to let Ganesha go as an act of sabotage?  ,2,18
SCULLY: W.A.O?  ,2,18
SCULLY: And you consider that inhumane treatment?  ,2,18
"SCULLY: According to FBI files, you've been arrested over a dozen times for activities involving the kidnapping of circus and zoo animals.  ",2,18
SCULLY: Hmmm. Were you involved in the liberation of Ganesha?  ,2,18
SCULLY: Preoccupied with what?  ,2,18
SCULLY: Will they win?  ,2,18
SCULLY: I thought you said she rescued this gorilla.  ,2,18
SCULLY: Even if that means trampling a man to death?  ,2,18
"SCULLY: Well, we found our suspects.  ",2,18
"SCULLY: Well, you heard the man - ""all animals should run free.""  ",2,18
"SCULLY: Well, the lights they were using at the construction site were mercury vapor, 10,000 candlepower. They can restrict a man's ability to adjust his vision to the dark. And their security cameras are poor quality. A gray elephant may not have registered an image on tape in the dim light in front of the building.  ",2,18
"SCULLY: These guys are dedicated to exactly this kind of activity, unabashedly. Did you check out the night vision camera they had lying on the shelf?  ",2,18
SCULLY: It wouldn't surprise me if they tried to capitalize on their success.  ,2,18
SCULLY: By liberating another animal. Willa Ambrose said that the zoo was in trouble financially. A loss of another big exhibit could shut them down entirely.  ,2,18
SCULLY: And where are you going?  ,2,18
"SCULLY: Mulder, it's me. I was right. I just followed the kid from the W.A.O. to the zoo. He's just about to make it over the fence.  ",2,18
SCULLY: There's a member of the W.A.O. on the premises.  ,2,18
SCULLY: What's going on?  ,2,18
SCULLY: You have no idea what he was doing at the zoo?  ,2,18
SCULLY: What if I said I saw this camera sitting up there on the shelf yesterday?  ,2,18
"SCULLY: A tiger is missing, and a member of your organization is dead. For such a principled man, you show an amazing lack of emotion.  ",2,18
"SCULLY: Well, if I find evidence that he was releasing those animals under your orders, I'll make sure you spend the rest of your life behind bars.  ",2,18
"SCULLY: You know, that guy really pisses me off.  ",2,18
SCULLY: Yeah.  ,2,18
SCULLY: Have they found the tiger yet?  ,2,18
SCULLY: What?  ,2,18
"SCULLY: You saw his body, Mulder. That kid was mauled to death. He had deep claw marks on his chest and on his back.  ",2,18
SCULLY: She speaks to you?  ,2,18
"SCULLY: Is this who you wanted to speak to, Mulder?  ",2,18
SCULLY: Why would she be afraid of the light?  ,2,18
"SCULLY: I hope you know what you're getting us into, Mulder.  ",2,18
SCULLY: This isn't exactly in my job description.  ,2,18
SCULLY: Okay.  ,2,18
"SCULLY: You're right, Mulder. The signs in the uterus and ovaries are unmistakable.  ",2,18
SCULLY: This animal had been pregnant.  ,2,18
SCULLY: There's evidence of hyperplasia and the corpus luteum is ruptured.  ,2,18
SCULLY: How'd the tiger get all the way across town without being spotted?  ,2,18
SCULLY: I just finished up in the infirmary. A sheriff's deputy came looking to serve you papers. I think it's about Sophie.  ,2,18
SCULLY: You want to see something interesting?  ,2,18
"SCULLY: I was looking for a pen to finish my report in Willa's office, and it was in her drawer.  ",2,18
SCULLY: Do you have any idea what he would have been doing at the zoo?  ,2,18
SCULLY: We have a witness who says that you visited Kyle's office yesterday. Is that true?  ,2,18
SCULLY: For what purpose?  ,2,18
SCULLY: Did you ask him to help you take Sophie to prevent her from being taken from you?  ,2,18
"SCULLY: But he helped you to rescue her originally, isn't that correct? He had a connection to you and to this animal that went back several years.  ",2,18
SCULLY: But you asked him anyway ... to help you.  ,2,18
"SCULLY: Then what was he doing here last night, and why did he give you this note?  ",2,18
SCULLY: Did he make a habit of visiting the zoo?  ,2,18
SCULLY: You think she's telling the truth?  ,2,18
"SCULLY: Well, Kyle Lang's death and the disappearance of the animal match the previous incidents.  ",2,18
SCULLY: And you've been pushing this alien abduction angle.  ,2,18
SCULLY: You mean to losing Sophie?  ,2,18
SCULLY: You think she killed him?  ,2,18
SCULLY: Even wait atop a stack of crates for a former lover to walk underneath?  ,2,18
SCULLY: Looks like you're in a hurry.  ,2,18
SCULLY: I'm afraid there is. I found evidence that Kyle died a wrongful death. He was hit with a cattle prod. There's gonna be an investigation so I have to read you your rights.  ,2,18
SCULLY: Ed Meecham took Sophie?  ,2,18
"SCULLY: Where is she, Willa?  ",2,18
SCULLY: Mulder? Mulder?  ,2,18
SCULLY: Sorry. Lie still.  ,2,18
SCULLY: Lie down. (to policeman) Can we get a paramedic in here?  ,2,18
SCULLY: Ed Meecham's been arrested. We picked him up on the way to Boise. That's how we found you here.  ,2,18
SCULLY: Who did?  ,2,18
SCULLY: She's outside. She's going in to make a statement about Kyle Lang.  ,2,18
SCULLY: (to officer) What happened here?  ,2,18
SCULLY: What was so urgent that you couldn't tell me over the phone?  ,2,19
SCULLY: Missing?  ,2,19
SCULLY: You're saying that a ship and its entire crew just vanished?  ,2,19
"SCULLY: Well, they must have reported what happened.  ",2,19
SCULLY: What's wrong with him?  ,2,19
"SCULLY: Mulder, wh ...?  ",2,19
SCULLY: Excuse me. Is this Lt. Richard Harper?  ,2,19
SCULLY: And he's been positively identified?  ,2,19
"SCULLY: Well, then I think there's been some kind of a mistake here. According to this report, Lt. Harper is 28 years old. (the nurse says nothing and walks away) Why hasn't a systemic workup been ordered on this patient?  ",2,19
SCULLY: Can you tell me what's going on here? How can you explain what happened to this man?  ,2,19
SCULLY: I am a medical doctor and I would like to see the autopsy reports on the remaining victims.  ,2,19
"SCULLY: Something very strange is going on here, Mulder.  ",2,19
"SCULLY: Yeah, I saw somebody, but whether it was actually the Lieutenant ...  ",2,19
SCULLY: He looked about 90 years old. Off by about half a century. You don't seem too surprised.  ,2,19
SCULLY: Another Bermuda Triangle?  ,2,19
SCULLY: (frowning) A wrinkle in time? Wh ...  ,2,19
"SCULLY: It was a, uh, a program during World War II to render battleships invisible to radar. But then the Manhattan Project heated up, and it was discontinued and most of the scientists were relocated to Los Alamos.  ",2,19
SCULLY: Where were they sent?  ,2,19
SCULLY: Are you suggesting that the Philadelphia Experiment used alien technology?  ,2,19
"SCULLY: That's not possible, Mulder, not without defying all laws of, of time and space.  ",2,19
SCULLY: Wormholes?  ,2,19
SCULLY: And that's what you think happened to Lt. Harper?  ,2,19
SCULLY: Have you let Skinner in on this?  ,2,19
"SCULLY: (looking back at the map) I'm going with you. If that really was Lt. Harper, I want to know what happened to him.  ",2,19
"SCULLY: What is it, Mulder? Why are they so afraid? My father spent the better part of his life at sea. He had a healthy respect for the ocean, but he never feared it. I see fear in these men's eyes.  ",2,19
SCULLY: You're American.  ,2,19
SCULLY: Why is everyone else so afraid to go there?  ,2,19
SCULLY: What stories?  ,2,19
SCULLY: A meteorite?  ,2,19
SCULLY: Feeling any better?  ,2,19
SCULLY: What?  ,2,19
SCULLY: (smiling) Oh.  ,2,19
SCULLY: Mulder. They almost look mummified.  ,2,19
SCULLY: Except for this strange residue.  ,2,19
SCULLY: What was that?  ,2,19
SCULLY: Nope.  ,2,19
SCULLY: No. What is it?  ,2,19
SCULLY: So we can't even send a distress signal.  ,2,19
"SCULLY: Well, the radio's dead too.  ",2,19
SCULLY: His skull's been fractured.  ,2,19
"SCULLY: Captain Barclay, um, according to your log, shortly after the navigation system failed, several of your crew members saw something in the sea - a growing light.  ",2,19
SCULLY: Do you have any idea what it might have been?  ,2,19
SCULLY: What happened?  ,2,19
"SCULLY: It's OK, captain. You can take it easy. We're gonna do whatever we can to help you out.  ",2,19
"SCULLY: Yeah, I'd have to agree with you. That blow that killed Halverson was delivered with considerable strength, and he can't even hold a glass with two hands.  ",2,19
SCULLY: The ship's log says something about four Norweigian sailors who were picked up when their vessel had sunk.  ,2,19
"SCULLY: Mulder, Captain Barclay is dead. I don't know how it happened, it was just in the last 15 minutes. It's just like those men below. It's more than rapid aging, Mulder. It's almost as if he's turning into a pillar of salt.  ",2,19
"SCULLY: Well, it appears to be crystalline, but beyond that ...?  ",2,19
SCULLY: Mmmm. I just fell asleep.  ,2,19
SCULLY: No. I'm up.  ,2,19
"SCULLY: Mulder, what happened to you?  ",2,19
"SCULLY: Time acceleration is an equation, Mulder, a theory.  ",2,19
"SCULLY: Well, whatever it is, it isn't a time warp. None of us has directly observed any of the phenomenon recorded in the ship's log. There is no hard evidence to indicate that this is a time warp.  ",2,19
"SCULLY: Well, if this is rapid aging phenomena, then why hasn't our hair greyed or started to fall out?  ",2,19
"SCULLY: Mulder, what do you know about free radicals?  ",2,19
"SCULLY: They are highly reactive chemicals containing extra electrons. Now, they can attack DNA proteins, they can cause our body tissue and cell membranes to oxidize.  ",2,19
SCULLY: It's the prevailing theory on how our bodies age.  ,2,19
"SCULLY: This is just a theory. But what if this ship is drifting towards another massive metallic source, like a meteor. Maybe it's way down deep in the ocean or embedded into an iceberg. But the two could effectively be acting as positive and negative terminals with the ocean itself being a kind of giant battery. That level of electromagnetic energy could be exciting the free radicals and effectively oxidizing every piece of matter in its field.  ",2,19
SCULLY: Captain Barclay said the ship was bleeding.  ,2,19
SCULLY: Mulder. Where are we going?  ,2,19
SCULLY: Why would they hold up here?  ,2,19
SCULLY: Contaminated how?  ,2,19
"SCULLY: Well, if you're right, then Captain Barclay's drinking binge is what kept him alive.  ",2,19
SCULLY: It doesn't sound like there's very much left.  ,2,19
SCULLY: Trondheim!  ,2,19
"SCULLY: Look, we have a lot of work to do here. I'm gonna need blood and urine samples from both of you.  ",2,19
SCULLY: We found out what caused the aging.  ,2,19
"SCULLY: It kept Olafsson alive this long, maybe it will slow the process in us.  ",2,19
"SCULLY: (voice-over) It has been 18 hours, 45 minutes since the onset of symptoms. Rudimentary blood tests have revealed impossibly high concentrations of sodium choloride - salt - though the contaminated water itself is not saline. It appears to catalyze existing body fluids, causing massive and rapid cellular damage. The untainted water has slowed the degenerative progression in Trondheim and me, but Mulder has fared less well, perhaps because of the dehydration he suffered on the way here.  ",2,19
SCULLY: I'll be right back.  ,2,19
"SCULLY: If you've got something to say, say it but don't hover behind me like that.  ",2,19
SCULLY: Then maybe we should double his rations.  ,2,19
SCULLY: We don't know that for sure. Not yet.  ,2,19
SCULLY: Who are you to decide?  ,2,19
"SCULLY: (voice-over) Mulder's urinalysis continues to indicate his kidneys' failure to excrete the substance I'm calling ""heavy salt"". Whether the untainted water taken from the sewage system is even helping him at all is unclear. What does remain clear to me is that I can't give up trying.  ",2,19
SCULLY: Trondheim! What are you doing?  ,2,19
SCULLY: There's enough to keep us all alive for a few more days.  ,2,19
SCULLY: Don't come any closer.  ,2,19
"SCULLY: Trondheim, listen to me. The navy knows where we are. They know these coordinates and they're gonna be here soon. So why don't we just go back up into the mess hall ...  ",2,19
SCULLY: Trondheim! Trondheim!  ,2,19
"SCULLY: Trondheim's locked himself in the sewage hold. He's backflushed all the water and he's keeping it for himself. I looked everywhere and this is all I could find. (she places a capped jar half full of yellowish liquid on the table) It's sardine juice, half a dozen lemons and uh, the water from a snow globe. (Mulder licks his lips) It's not Evian, but ...  ",2,19
"SCULLY: No, Mulder!  ",2,19
SCULLY: That's more reason for you to drink it.  ,2,19
"SCULLY: Don't do this, Mulder.  ",2,19
"SCULLY: Well, there isn't much liquid to make a difference anyway.  ",2,19
SCULLY: No.  ,2,19
SCULLY: What was that?  ,2,19
SCULLY: Mulder ... the water.  ,2,19
"SCULLY: Mulder ... When they found me, after the doctors and even my family had given up, I experienced something that I never told you about. Even now it's hard to find the words. But there's one thing I'm certain of. As certain as I am of this life, we have nothing to fear when it's over.  ",2,19
SCULLY: You should sleep.  ,2,19
"SCULLY: (voice-over) Agent Fox Mulder lost consciousness at approximately 4:30 this morning, the 12th of March. There is nothing more I can do for him, or for myself. Supplies are exhausted, no food or liquid consumed for over 24 hours. The outer hull most probably flooded, though for now the inner hull is supporting the ship's mass. Among Halverson's belongings, I found a children's book of Norse legends. From what I can tell, the pictures show the end of the world - not in a sudden firestorm of damnation as the Bible teaches us, but in a slow covering blanket of snow. First the moon and the stars will be lost in a dense white fog, then the rivers and the lakes and the sea will freeze over. And finally a wolf named Skoll will open his jaws and eat the sun, sending the world into an everlasting night. I think I hear the wolf at the door.  ",2,19
SCULLY: (groggily) Mmmm. Yeah.  ,2,19
SCULLY: Mulder? Where is he?  ,2,19
SCULLY: Whatever caused this is still out there. I have to talk to a naval liaison. We have to salvage the ship in order to study the salt ...  ,2,19
SCULLY: How?  ,2,21
SCULLY: And did the inquest come up with anything unusual?  ,2,21
SCULLY: Did you learn about wind in kindergarten?  ,2,21
SCULLY: Pulled? By whom?  ,2,21
"SCULLY: So you're saying that, uh, a ghost killed Teddy Holvey. (Mulder nods and points to the screen as Burk smirks) Has anyone checked the camera that took this photo - the lens or the pressure plate?  ",2,21
"SCULLY: Mulder, this information is the same reason why you'll see a newspaper photo with Jesus' face appearing in the, in the foliage of an elm tree. It's a chance occurrence of light and shadow.  ",2,21
SCULLY: I've seen some pretty slippery two-year-olds.  ,2,21
"SCULLY: Mrs. Holvey, at the time of the accident, did you have any hired help?  ",2,21
SCULLY: What is she saying?  ,2,21
"SCULLY: Sure, it's a swastika.  ",2,21
SCULLY: You're right. I saw her drawing it.  ,2,21
"SCULLY: Well, I think this boy needs as much protection as he can get - but just not from ghosties or beasties. Take a look at this. (hands him a folder) Have you ever heard of Munchausen by Proxy?  ",2,21
"SCULLY: It's when a parent or caretaker brings harm to a child by inducing medical symptoms, usually as a way of getting attention or status. If you take a look at Teddy Holvey's medical history, you'll see that he was admitted to various hospitals ten times during the two years that he was alive. That's once every three months.  ",2,21
SCULLY: Each time they were unable to determine the cause of the illness.  ,2,21
"SCULLY: Well, the family moved around a lot because of Steve's job, and records take time to transfer from hospital to hospital. But this kind of abuse is not limited to just one child, so I checked out Charlie's history as well.  ",2,21
"SCULLY: Since his brother was born, which is right when Holvey's mother-in-law moved in. Often the perpetrator of Munchausen by Proxy will view the child as evil. The old woman would be a likely candidate, but it could be any family member.  ",2,21
SCULLY: And you suspect Golda?  ,2,21
SCULLY: Are you familiar with Munchausen by Proxy?  ,2,21
SCULLY: Teddy's medical records have raised some questions.  ,2,21
"SCULLY: I'd like to interview your son Charlie, Mr. Holvey, but with a professional counsellor.  ",2,21
SCULLY: What was that?  ,2,21
SCULLY: Mulder!  ,2,21
SCULLY: Find anything?  ,2,21
SCULLY: Looks like ash.  ,2,21
SCULLY: The Holveys said earlier that they had some problems with the wiring of the house. It could be from the motor shorted out ...  ,2,21
"SCULLY: Well, what do you think it is?  ",2,21
"SCULLY: Well, before we do anything, I think we should get Charlie out of this house. I just put a call into a social worker who's gonna come down and make a report.  ",2,21
SCULLY: Not when a child is in danger ... and not after they see two dead roosters in the old woman's bedroom.  ,2,21
SCULLY: Without a doubt. (the garage door starts to open) What did you do?  ,2,21
SCULLY: What?  ,2,21
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,2,21
SCULLY: Where are we going?  ,2,21
SCULLY: India?  ,2,21
SCULLY: Wait a second. Nothing just materializes out of thin air.  ,2,21
"SCULLY: Yeah, but that was a parable.  ",2,21
SCULLY: Too bad you didn't take a picture. You could have run it through your computer and seen the entire Last Supper.  ,2,21
"SCULLY: Yeah, that or somebody activated the remote control.  ",2,21
"SCULLY: Well, who was standing outside when the garage door opened unexpectedly on us yesterday?  ",2,21
"SCULLY: He says he doesn't remember anything. Now, the coroner's preliminary report states that she died of a heart attack ... but those wounds, Mulder, I'd swear it looked like her eyes were pecked out.  ",2,21
SCULLY: What is it?  ,2,21
SCULLY: You think this was a ritual killing?  ,2,21
SCULLY: Protection against what?  ,2,21
SCULLY: Mrs. Holvey?  ,2,21
SCULLY: What did he say?  ,2,21
SCULLY: Punish you for what?  ,2,21
SCULLY: I think we should talk to Charlie and find out what happened in your mother's bedroom.  ,2,21
SCULLY: Mrs. Holvey?  ,2,21
"SCULLY: Don't restrain him. Let's turn him on his side so he doesn't aspirate. Charlie, you're going to be OK.  ",2,21
SCULLY: He's resting. How's Mrs. Holvey?  ,2,21
"SCULLY: The doctor said that Charlie had some kind of a siezure, but they've been unable to determine a cause.  ",2,21
SCULLY: Is that Mrs. Holvey?  ,2,21
SCULLY: There. I think she's got Charlie with her.  ,2,21
SCULLY: (calling down the hall) Nurse!  ,2,21
SCULLY: Who? Charlie?  ,2,21
SCULLY: Why?  ,2,21
SCULLY: You're saying Mrs. Holvey left here with a ghost?  ,2,21
"SCULLY: But, Mulder ...  ",2,21
SCULLY: What are you gonna do?  ,2,21
SCULLY: Mrs. Holvey?  ,2,21
SCULLY: Hello?  ,2,21
SCULLY: Charlie?  ,2,21
SCULLY: Are you all right?  ,2,21
SCULLY: We're OK. How's Charlie?  ,2,21
"SCULLY: According to my briefing, the prisoners escaped by hiding in a laundry cart.  ",2,22
SCULLY: And they're both serving life terms. Murder convictions.  ,2,22
SCULLY: It is.  ,2,22
SCULLY: I don't know. Looks like some kind of de-con situation.  ,2,22
SCULLY: That's right. We have orders to work with the federal marshals on this manhunt.  ,2,22
SCULLY: We don't know why we've been sent here. Maybe if we talked to the warden or someone...  ,2,22
SCULLY: Why?  ,2,22
SCULLY: It came out of Skinner's office.  ,2,22
"SCULLY: No, why?  ",2,22
"SCULLY: I've got the same feeling, Mulder.  ",2,22
SCULLY: I can try. Where are you going?  ,2,22
SCULLY: Who are you?  ,2,22
SCULLY: Are you the prison doctor?  ,2,22
SCULLY: Who do you work for?  ,2,22
SCULLY: You work for the Centers for Disease Control? What are you doing here?  ,2,22
SCULLY: So am I.  ,2,22
SCULLY: How many people are infected?  ,2,22
SCULLY: Any deaths?  ,2,22
SCULLY: What are the chances the men who escaped are infected?  ,2,22
"SCULLY: Mulder, it's me. I'm starting to get a picture of what's going on here.  ",2,22
SCULLY: There seems to be some kind of...  ,2,22
"SCULLY: Well, from what I've seen so far, thirty-six hours after infection, deadly.  ",2,22
SCULLY: The exact nature of this thing...  ,2,22
SCULLY: Not until I get some answers.  ,2,22
"SCULLY: I'm a federal agent, sir.  ",2,22
"SCULLY: To my partner, who needs to know if the men he's pursuing are infected.  ",2,22
"SCULLY: Well, then I want to see charts and I want access to the infirmary.  ",2,22
SCULLY: I need to know what these men are dying from. You said this was some kind of flu-like illness. What are these?  ,2,22
SCULLY: Do all of the victims have these boils?  ,2,22
"SCULLY: Yes, I'm trying to trace the origin of a package that was sent to Robert Torrence at the Cumberland State Correctional Facilit in Virginia. Y, yeah. The packaging number is D-D-P-one-one-two-one-four-eight. Sure, I'll hold.  ",2,22
SCULLY: What do you know about Pinck Pharmaceuticals?  ,2,22
SCULLY: They sent a package to a prisoner here who may have been the first victim of the contagion.  ,2,22
"SCULLY: No, it's empty.  ",2,22
"SCULLY: That sounds like what I'm finding on all the victims in here. Do you know what that means, Mulder?  ",2,22
SCULLY: I'm on it.  ,2,22
SCULLY: Why? What's going on?  ,2,22
SCULLY: What the hell is going on?  ,2,22
"SCULLY: By who, the C.D.C.?  ",2,22
SCULLY: Pinck Pharmaceuticals. You work for Pinck Pharmaceuticals?  ,2,22
SCULLY: Disappeared how?  ,2,22
SCULLY: Like this?  ,2,22
SCULLY: Is this what caused the outbreak?  ,2,22
SCULLY: So the contagion only spreads when the pustules erupt and the larvae that are expelled burrow into the new host.  ,2,22
"SCULLY: Mulder, they're enforcing a full quarantine.  ",2,22
SCULLY: One of the epidimiologists who claimed to be with the C.D.C. told me that this was no accident.  ,2,22
SCULLY: Why else would the national guard be here?  ,2,22
SCULLY: The public?  ,2,22
"SCULLY: Mulder, we can't leak this, not until we know more.  ",2,22
SCULLY: If this gets out...  ,2,22
SCULLY: What if someone dies because we didn't?  ,2,22
SCULLY: Yeah. I'm okay. All I want you to worry about is capturing that fugitive.  ,2,22
SCULLY: And if I am?  ,2,22
SCULLY: How long will this take?  ,2,22
SCULLY: What?  ,2,22
SCULLY: What do you want me to do?  ,2,22
SCULLY: Why did you confide in me?  ,2,22
SCULLY: How can I prove it?  ,2,22
SCULLY: What are you doing?  ,2,22
SCULLY: You don't work for the C.D.C.  ,2,22
"SCULLY: Well, we'll leave that up to others to decide.  ",2,22
SCULLY: Mulder... I think everything here is under control.  ,2,22
SCULLY: Yeah.  ,2,22
"SCULLY: He's alive? Mulder, listen to me. Everything here has been destroyed.  ",2,22
"SCULLY: If you want the truth, Mulder, he's going to have to make a statement.  ",2,22
"SCULLY: We can't prove a thing, Mulder. They've made sure of it.  ",2,22
SCULLY: The Costa Rican government just faxed me the report on the missing scientist.  ,2,22
"SCULLY: Come on, let's go.  ",2,22
"SCULLY: Two apparent abductions in less than a month, and then this one last night. According to my contact, the Richmond PD has hit a brick wall so I told her we'd come down and have a look.  ",2,23
"SCULLY: Her name is Kelly Ryan. She was one of my students when I was teaching at the academy. She's just been bumped up to detective, and she's a little nervous about her supervisor finding out the FBI are involved.  ",2,23
SCULLY: Kelly?  ,2,23
SCULLY: Hi.  ,2,23
SCULLY: This is Agent Mulder.  ,2,23
"SCULLY: Uh, the heat register.  ",2,23
SCULLY: What is it?  ,2,23
SCULLY: Was Patrick Newirth a smoker?  ,2,23
"SCULLY: Well, that's strange for someone who works for a tobacco company.  ",2,23
SCULLY: Could be the residue from burnt human flesh.  ,2,23
"SCULLY: What are you thinking, Mulder?  ",2,23
SCULLY: You're doing just fine.  ,2,23
SCULLY: Having a little fun?  ,2,23
SCULLY: Spontaneous human combustion?  ,2,23
SCULLY: Let's just forget for the moment that there's no scientific theory to support it.  ,2,23
SCULLY: Darkness covers a multitude of sins.  ,2,23
"SCULLY: Neat trick. For your birthday, I'll buy you a utility belt.  ",2,23
"SCULLY: Look at this, Mulder.  ",2,23
"SCULLY: Margaret Wysnecki, age 66. Widowed, retired from Laramie Tobacco where she worked production line for 36 years. Tobacco? Patrick Newirth worked for Morley Tobacco, didn't he?  ",2,23
"SCULLY: Yeah, you're probably right. The first missing person, Gail Anne Lambert, was an engineer for Polarity Magnetics.  ",2,23
SCULLY: That's the same day she disappeared.  ,2,23
"SCULLY: And Gail Anne Lambert ... uh, no it doesn't say anything here that puts her anywhere near the Richmond Train Station.  ",2,23
"SCULLY: Well, even so, what's the significance?  ",2,23
SCULLY: And whatever happened to spontaneous human combustion?  ,2,23
"SCULLY: What happened here, Kelly?  ",2,23
"SCULLY: Well, you were just doing your job.  ",2,23
SCULLY: You just make sure you hang onto this case. I'm sure something will turn up.  ,2,23
"SCULLY: These ideas of yours, Mulder, you care to share them?  ",2,23
"SCULLY: You don't have a clue, do you?  ",2,23
"SCULLY: All right, where does this leave us?  ",2,23
SCULLY: How?  ,2,23
SCULLY: Those are the dates that Margaret Wysnecki and Patrick Newirth disappeared.  ,2,23
SCULLY: That's assuming we're looking for a guy.  ,2,23
"SCULLY: It could be any one of these people, Mulder ... or none of them. I've gone through the entire week and I'm still not sure how you expect to find him.  ",2,23
SCULLY: Again?  ,2,23
"SCULLY: Chances are, he's not walking around carrying a sign with an arrow on it.  ",2,23
SCULLY: Looking at the floor.  ,2,23
SCULLY: Probably the same reason he spends his whole afternoon in the train station.  ,2,23
SCULLY: That's where the first victim worked.  ,2,23
SCULLY: Looks like it's been closed up.  ,2,23
SCULLY: We're agents Mulder and Scully with the FBI. We're looking for a man who may have worked here.  ,2,23
SCULLY: You mean he's not any more?  ,2,23
SCULLY: Subatomic particles.  ,2,23
SCULLY: Except no one knows if they truly exist.  ,2,23
SCULLY: This is a particle accelerator.  ,2,23
SCULLY: Exactly what happened here?  ,2,23
SCULLY: How did he survive?  ,2,23
"SCULLY: Well, this looks like the same kind of material that they found at each of the other crime scenes. Maybe what we're dealing with is some kind of spontaneous human combustion.  ",2,23
SCULLY: What do you think it is?  ,2,23
"SCULLY: Well, whatever it is, we have to find him.  ",2,23
"SCULLY: There's no sign of him, Mulder. Maybe he's moved on. What are you looking at?  ",2,23
"SCULLY: Well, maybe the exposure affected his mind. Nonsensical repetitive behavior is a common trait of mental illness.  ",2,23
SCULLY: I called Detective Ryan. She's having the prints on the lightbulbs checked against Banton's.  ,2,23
"SCULLY: No, I only told her that he was a possible suspect, and that it was a bit too early to get her hopes up, and that right now we have more questions than we do answers.  ",2,23
"SCULLY: Like a motive, like a murder weapon, like ...  ",2,23
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,2,23
SCULLY: Looking for his shadow?  ,2,23
SCULLY: The accident in the lab ... the quanta bombardment ... you believe that altered you physically?  ,2,23
SCULLY: But it has something to do with dark matter.  ,2,23
SCULLY: That's how you killed Gail Anne Lambert?  ,2,23
SCULLY: Agent Mulder and I are here strictly in an unofficial capacity.  ,2,23
SCULLY: We were curious about the unexplained nature of the case.  ,2,23
"SCULLY: Come on, Mulder, let's go.  ",2,23
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,2,23
"SCULLY: Ambition? She's a woman trying to survive the boys' club, Mulder. Believe me, I know how she feels.  ",2,23
"SCULLY: Look. The fact is, we have no jurisdiction here. We were called in as a favor.  ",2,23
SCULLY: I'm sure all the necessary precautions will be taken.  ,2,23
"SCULLY: You don't believe all this paranoia about brain sucking, do you?  ",2,23
"SCULLY: Mulder, as brilliant as Dr. Banton may be, he is also clearly delusional. He demonstrated just about every textbook indicator back there.  ",2,23
"SCULLY: Look, I don't know how to explain it, but that's not our job. I don't know what else we should do.  ",2,23
SCULLY: Mulder.  ,2,23
SCULLY: Richmond PD had two officers outside watching the entrance. They didn't see anybody come in.  ,2,23
SCULLY: Three? The power was disconnected at a substation two blocks from here. Somebody posing as the city engineer.  ,2,23
SCULLY: Somebody from the government coming for Dr. Banton?  ,2,23
SCULLY: That's what Detective Ryan thinks.  ,2,23
SCULLY: She was in charge of Dr. Banton's transfer and arraignment this morning. She's in some pretty hot water.  ,2,23
"SCULLY: Where? Mulder, wait. Where are we going?  ",2,23
SCULLY: I heard him say a lot of things.  ,2,23
"SCULLY: Wait a second. That's still just a theory, and it's a pretty wild one at that.  ",2,23
SCULLY: And apparently so does whoever it is that tried to take him last night.  ,2,23
"SCULLY: We're not the first ones here, Mulder, that's Detective Ryan's car.  ",2,23
SCULLY: Mulder.  ,2,23
SCULLY: What's that noise?  ,2,23
SCULLY: Mulder.  ,2,23
SCULLY: He must have killed her and then killed himself.  ,2,23
SCULLY: By who?  ,2,23
"SCULLY: I'm not sure how to feel about this, Mulder. She was my student, and she came to me for help.  ",2,23
SCULLY: This shouldn't have happened. This never should have happened.  ,2,23
SCULLY: Doing what?  ,2,23
SCULLY: I'm not sure I follow you.  ,2,23
SCULLY: Do they have any leads or know where he might be?  ,2,23
SCULLY: But you do.  ,2,23
"SCULLY: Well, if Banton's not dead, then where is he?  ",2,23
"SCULLY: Come on, Mulder, don't you see what they're doing? They're wasting our time. They're sending us on some kind of a wild goose chase.  ",2,24
"SCULLY: I'm not questioning the case's legitimacy, just their motives in assigning it to us. I mean, doesn't it bother you at all that they're undermining your work?  ",2,24
"SCULLY: Yes, I read that report. She claims that she saw some kind of a-a foxfire spirit. I'm surprised she didn't call Oprah as soon as she got off the phone with the police.  ",2,24
"SCULLY: (closing her eyes, exasperated) Those are only legends, Mulder.  ",2,24
SCULLY: This could have been made by anything-- a bonfire.  ,2,24
SCULLY: I didnt think anything gave you nightmares.  ,2,24
"SCULLY: What's this, Mulder?  ",2,24
"SCULLY: Well, Sheriff Arens, a man is missing.  ",2,24
SCULLY: How do you mean?  ,2,24
SCULLY: Did he have many chances?  ,2,24
SCULLY: Is that what his wife thinks happened?  ,2,24
SCULLY: So you're fairly certain that he left you for somebody else.  ,2,24
SCULLY: Do you have any idea who he might be with now?  ,2,24
SCULLY: Did your husband ever receive any threatening phone calls or anything unusual in the mail?  ,2,24
"SCULLY: Well, theres a possibility that his disappearance may have something to do with a report he was about to file with the Department of Agriculture.  ",2,24
SCULLY: Well he cited multiple violations.  ,2,24
SCULLY: Was there any merit to his claims?  ,2,24
SCULLY: So he really did threaten to shut the plant down.  ,2,24
SCULLY: Problem enough to do something about?  ,2,24
SCULLY: What are you talking about?  ,2,24
"SCULLY: Yeah, I read about that. It's caused by high-speed repetitive activity.  ",2,24
SCULLY: What happened to his lawsuit?  ,2,24
"SCULLY: So, Mulder, are you ready to admit they sent us on a fool's errand?  ",2,24
"SCULLY: (impatient) Well, whether George Kearns skipped town or somebody killed him, this case could've been handled by any agent under the Kansas City office.  ",2,24
SCULLY. Everyone stay calm. Don't hurt him. Just tell us what you want. Dont get excited. Just calm down. Stay calm. We dont want anyone to get hurt. We can talk this thing out. Why dont you give me the knife?  ,2,24
SCULLY: (to JESS HAROLD) You okay?  ,2,24
SCULLY: Do you have any idea what might have prompted her attack?  ,2,24
SCULLY: No recent complaints or strange behavior?  ,2,24
SCULLY: Were you able to determine the cause?  ,2,24
SCULLY: You didn't find anything physically wrong with her?  ,2,24
SCULLY: Could it have been line hypnosis?  ,2,24
SCULLY: How did you treat them?  ,2,24
"SCULLY: Well, I think an autopsy on Paula Gray would clarify things.  ",2,24
SCULLY: Why? You're a physician.  ,2,24
"SCULLY: Were sorry to disturb you, sir. We realize this is a difficult time for you.  ",2,24
SCULLY: That's what we're hoping a postmortem will determine.  ,2,24
SCULLY: I assume youre talking about George Kearns.  ,2,24
SCULLY: Then you're aware of his recommendation to close down your plant?  ,2,24
"SCULLY: I think weve got something here, Mulder. Take a look at this.  ",2,24
SCULLY: It's a specimen from Paula Gray's brain. She suffered from a rare degenerative disorder called Creutzfeldt- Jacob disease. It's characterized by the formation of spongelike holes in the brain tissue.  ,2,24
SCULLY: Short of an autopsy it's very difficult to diagnose. Outside of a textbook Ive only seen infected tissue once and that was back in medical school.  ,2,24
"SCULLY: Absolutely. Victims of Creutzfeldt-Jacob suffer from progressive dementia, severe seizures...  ",2,24
SCULLY: This girl would have been dead in months.  ,2,24
SCULLY: Theres got to be some kind of a mistake.  ,2,24
SCULLY: The odds that Paula Gray and George Kearns had the same disease are practically nonexistent. Creutzfeldt-Jacob can be hereditary but it's not communicable. That two unrelated people in the same small town would contract the same rare disease is...  ,2,24
"SCULLY: Mulder, look out!  ",2,24
SCULLY: (on phone) This is Federal Agent Scully. Id like to report an accident on Count A7   ,2,24
SCULLY: I just got off the phone with Dr. Randolph. He said this driver had the same symptoms as Paula Gray and George Kearns.  ,2,24
"SCULLY: Well, they would be. (pause) I just came up with a sick theory, Mulder.  ",2,24
SCULLY: You saw the feed grinders at the plant. What if somebody put George Kearnss body in there? Creutzfeldt-Jacob is a prion disease which means it could have been passed on to the chickens and in turn anyone who consumed them.  ,2,24
"SCULLY: It's possible. You know, sometimes in England they'll incinerate cattle to keep them from passing mad cow disease on to people.  ",2,24
SCULLY: Mulder .  ,2,24
"SCULLY: Well, so far Ive been able to isolate nine distinct skeletons. This one belonged to the late George Kearns.  ",2,24
"SCULLY: The pin in his femur. According to his medical file, Kearns broke his right leg four years ago.  ",2,24
"SCULLY: Well. I'll need more sophisticated equipment to be certain, but I estimate that some of these bones are as much as 20 or 30 years old. All of them share one strange detail, though.  ",2,24
"SCULLY: Well, besides that. The older bones show signs of decay and surface abrasion just like you'd expect but for some reason all of them, even Kearnss, are smooth and buffed at the ends.  ",2,24
"SCULLY: It could be from erosion from the water, but...  ",2,24
SCULLY: Any theories?  ,2,24
SCULLY: Then it may have been the work of some kind of a cult.  ,2,24
SCULLY: You think these people were eaten?  ,2,24
"SCULLY: Well, then Paula Gray may have contracted Creutzfeldt-Jacob by eating George Kearns.  ",2,24
SCULLY: What are you talking about?  ,2,24
SCULLY: Cannibalism is one thing but increasing longevity by eating human flesh...  ,2,24
SCULLY: We never confirmed the date of birth on her personnel file.  ,2,24
SCULLY: Smells like a recent fire.  ,2,24
SCULLY: You think someone was expecting us?  ,2,24
SCULLY: Where are you going?  ,2,24
SCULLY: Mrs. Kearns?! Mrs. Kearns?!  ,2,24
SCULLY: Mrs. Kearns?  ,2,24
SCULLY: (on phone) Scully.  ,2,24
"SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah, Mrs. Kearns is missing too, Mulder. I think someones been here. (we see shape of someone, CHACO in the house with her) The power was cut and the back door was wide open when I got here. But her car is still out back.  ",2,24
SCULLY: Mm-Mm.  ,2,24
"SCULLY: (voiceover) Pending further review, the Chaco processing plant has been closed by the USDA. So far, no evidence of contaminated chicken has been discovered. Though it remains unknown how many citizens participated in the ritual activity, 27 have become fatally ill with Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease. What is known is that a transport plane carrying Walter Chaco was shot down in 1944 over New Guinea. Chaco was the only survivor of that crash. According to naval records, he spent six months with the Jole -- a tribe whose cannibalistic practices have long been suspected but never proven. Naval records also show that Walter Chaco was born in 1902 making him 93 years old at the time of his death. As of this date, his remains still have not been found.  ",2,24
"SCULLY: Mulder, Skinner's looking for you. ",2,25
"SCULLY: Why, what's going on.? ",2,25
SCULLY: You want me to recite them.? ,2,25
SCULLY: What are you talking about.? ,2,25
SCULLY: What is this.? ,2,25
SCULLY: Where did you get this.? ,2,25
"SCULLY: Mulder, this may not be gibberish. ",2,25
"SCULLY: I think it's just encrypted and I think I recognise it. It looks like Navajo. It was used in world war two. My father told me it was the only code the Japanese couldn't break, I... I remember the long strings of consonants. ",2,25
SCULLY: Well only a handful of people can decipher it. ,2,25
SCULLY: Mulder. Are you okay.? ,2,25
SCULLY: Yes sir. ,2,25
SCULLY: No sir. Agent Mulder told me he was having trouble sleeping. ,2,25
"SCULLY: Of course, he's my partner. ",2,25
SCULLY: Yes sir. A year and a half ago. I've been writing regular reports stating the validity of agent Mulder's work on The X-Files. ,2,25
SCULLY: Am I accused of lying.? ,2,25
SCULLY: What action is that.? ,2,25
SCULLY: Is that all sir.? ,2,25
SCULLY: You didn't answer your door. ,2,25
SCULLY: I couldn't find you at work. I was worried about you. ,2,25
SCULLY: They called me in today. ,2,25
SCULLY: That nothing was wrong. ,2,25
"SCULLY: Mulder, you opened the door for them, they're just looking for a good reason now. ",2,25
"SCULLY: Mulder, these files. Who knows you have them.? ",2,25
SCULLY: Because I had to lie today. And I put my job in jeopardy in order to do so. If they find out about those files... ,2,25
"SCULLY: Maybe they already know. The question is, is it worth it.? Is this cassette worth risking everything.? ",2,25
"SCULLY: I'm meeting with someone in an hour. I might know something later tonight, I just need some kind of assurance that they're not going to let us hang ourselves with this. That I'm doing the right thing. ",2,25
SCULLY: I need to know one more thing Mulder. Why did you attack Skinner.? ,2,25
SCULLY: Currently yes. ,2,25
"SCULLY: Yeah, thank you... er... can you tell me which words you do recognise.? ",2,25
SCULLY: Thank you. You've been very helpful.  ,2,25
SCULLY: Mulder.  ,2,25
SCULLY: Hello. ,2,25
SCULLY: Where are you.? ,2,25
SCULLY: Mulder where are you.? Just tell me where you are. ,2,25
SCULLY: Who shot him Mulder.? ,2,25
"SCULLY: Mulder, were you arguing.? ",2,25
SCULLY: Mulder listen to me... ,2,25
"SCULLY: Mulder I believe you, just listen to me, you've gotta get out of there, you have to leave immediately. ",2,25
"SCULLY: Mulder they're gonna suspect you anyway, you've got no ID on the shooter, you, your behavior has been irrational recently, Mulder can't you see that everything is pointing directly at you? ",2,25
"SCULLY: Damn it Mulder, you're an FBI agent, you have access to weapons other than your own. ",2,25
"SCULLY: No. No you can't come home. Someone shot through your window tonight, they almost killed me, they might be trying to kill you.  ",2,25
SCULLY: Fox... My God. Look at you. You're sick. ,2,25
"SCULLY: No come on, I want you to lie down on, woah, come on I want you to lie down, let me take your coat off. ",2,25
SCULLY: Right now you have to lie down. Come here. ,2,25
"SCULLY: Well right now you need to rest okay, rest. It's okay. Okay.  ",2,25
SCULLY: How long will it take to determine if there a match.? ,2,25
SCULLY: I took your gun to run it through ballistics to try and clear you Mulder. ,2,25
SCULLY: You had a temperature of 102 last night I didn't want to wake you. ,2,25
"SCULLY: Mulder, I'm being called into Skinners office this afternoon, they're gonna want answers and I'd like some good ones to give them. ",2,25
"SCULLY: Mulder you're sick, you're not thinking straight, I'm on your side. You know that. ",2,25
SCULLY: Mul...  ,2,25
"SCULLY: Mulder, don't shoot him. Just back away.  ",2,25
SCULLY: I have him Mulder. ,2,25
"SCULLY: Mulder, Mulder it's me. Here drink some of that, you haven't had any water in over 36 hours. Your shoulder's going to be fine. The round went through nice and clean. ",2,25
"SCULLY: Yes, I did. You didn't give me much choice, you were going to shoot Krycek. ",2,25
"SCULLY: If he is, then his weapon is probably the same one that killed your father. ",2,25
"SCULLY: If you killed Krycek with that weapon there would have been no way to prove that you didn't kill your father. I'm sorry about your father Mulder, I haven't been able to tell you. ",2,25
"SCULLY: I didn't. I went back to your apartment to pull the slug from the wall, but I noticed an unmarked van delivering soft water and I found this in one of the tanks servicing your building. ",2,25
"SCULLY: It's a dyalysis filter. It's a device used in the transmission of substance to solution, considering the level of psychosis you were experiencing, it was probably LSD, amphetamines of some kind of exotic dopamine agonist. ",2,25
SCULLY: Well it wasn't an excercise in subtlety. Mulder these men are quite possibly the same ones who killed your father and who systematically tried to destroy you by turning everyone you could trust against you. I don't think I have to tell you why. ,2,25
SCULLY: We're in Farmington New Mexico. ,2,25
"SCULLY: We've just driven two days across country, I had to put you out to let the side effects of the psychosis abait. This is Albert Hosteen, he's been translating your files. ",2,25
SCULLY: Albert was a Navajo code talker during world war two. He helped encode the original government documents. ,2,25
SCULLY: Through a woman in Washington. But he claims he knew you were coming. ,2,25
SCULLY: Most of these files are written in jargon but apparently there was an international conspiracy of silence dating back to the 1940's. Albert says that evidence of these secrets are buried on a Navajo reservation not far from here. He says that he'll take you as soon as you are able.  ,2,25
SCULLY: I'm afraid you're on your own with this. I didn't show up for a meeting with Skinner the day before yesterday and I don't know what the repercussions will be. ,2,25
SCULLY: I was certain they would have killed you Mulder. ,2,25
SCULLY: There's something else. My name is in those files. It appears in the latest entries with Duane Barry's. ,2,25
"SCULLY: It's not clear, but it has something to do with a test. I want you to find out Mulder. I need you to.  ",2,25
SCULLY: Scully. ,2,25
SCULLY: Where are you.? ,2,25
SCULLY: What do you mean.? ,2,25
SCULLY: Bodies.? ,2,25
SCULLY: What happened to them.? ,2,25
"SCULLY: Mulder, in these files I found references to experiments that were conducted here in the US by Axis Power scientists who were given amnesty after the war. ",2,25
"SCULLY: Some kind of tests, on humans. What they referred to as merchandise. ",2,25
SCULLY: Are you sure.? ,2,25
SCULLY: Mulder... ,2,25
SCULLY: What happened?  ,3,1
SCULLY: Where is he?  ,3,1
SCULLY: Where's Agent Mulder?  ,3,1
SCULLY: In the trunk.  ,3,1
SCULLY: I don't have it!  ,3,1
SCULLY: Agent Mulder.  ,3,1
"SCULLY: I've told you everything I know. To the best of my knowledge, Agent Mulder is dead.  ",3,1
SCULLY: Who are these people?  ,3,1
SCULLY: What they're doing is putting an official stamp on the perpetuation of a lie.  ,3,1
SCULLY: What about the people who were poisoning Agent Mulder's water? Whose protocol was that?  ,3,1
"SCULLY: The investigation will be an exercise! The men who killed Agent Mulder, the people who killed his father, they aren't meant to be found.  ",3,1
"SCULLY: With all due respect, sir, I think you overestimate your position in the chain of command.  ",3,1
"SCULLY: Hi, mom.  ",3,1
"SCULLY: They, uh, they started to give me blisters s, so...  ",3,1
"SCULLY: Oh, mom...  ",3,1
SCULLY: I've made a terrible mistake. Dad would be so ashamed of me.  ,3,1
SCULLY: Frohike?  ,3,1
SCULLY: How much have you had to drink?  ,3,1
"SCULLY: Uh, I'm afraid not. I'm soon to be out of a job.  ",3,1
"SCULLY: And like rats, they just scatter back into the woodpile.  ",3,1
SCULLY: What's this?  ,3,1
"SCULLY: ""Kenneth J. Soona was killed execution style in what appears to be a professional murder. His body found in the Trenton City landfill."" What's the date on this?  ",3,1
SCULLY: For now.  ,3,1
SCULLY: No.  ,3,1
SCULLY: It's okay.  ,3,1
SCULLY: Thank you.  ,3,1
"SCULLY: Yes, sir. I came across a news article. A man's body was found in New Jersey and I have reason to believe that he was killed by the same man responsible for Agent Mulder.  ",3,1
"SCULLY: The date of death postdates Agent Mulder's disappearance. Now, you already have the ballistics data from Agent Mulder's father on file. I would like you to run it against the ballistics from this man's case.  ",3,1
"SCULLY: Well, if both men were killed by the same weapon, we could prove that Agent Mulder didn't kill his father and it could also help us find the man who did.  ",3,1
"SCULLY: Yes, I know that, sir. I just thought this might be helpful.  ",3,1
SCULLY: You don't want to check?  ,3,1
"SCULLY: I was just trying to cooperate with your investigation, sir.  ",3,1
SCULLY: No. I just want answers.  ,3,1
SCULLY: I don't have it.  ,3,1
SCULLY: I believe so.  ,3,1
"SCULLY: Is that all, sir?  ",3,1
"SCULLY: I'm just curious about something, would you mind if I went through here again?  ",3,1
SCULLY: Would you mind running the wand over me one more time?  ,3,1
"SCULLY: No, not today.  ",3,1
SCULLY: What do you think it could be?  ,3,1
SCULLY: I don't know how it could have gotten there.  ,3,1
SCULLY: Yeah.  ,3,1
SCULLY: It looks like a computer chip.  ,3,1
SCULLY: I don't even know how long its been in there. I have absolutely no recollection of it being put there.  ,3,1
SCULLY: I don't have access to the F.B.I. labs.  ,3,1
SCULLY: Hmmm...  ,3,1
SCULLY: Melissa...  ,3,1
SCULLY: No!  ,3,1
SCULLY: I was afraid...  ,3,1
SCULLY: Um... that I would die...  ,3,1
"SCULLY: There were men... um, a man took me and, uh... there was a light and... loud sounds, my, um... my ears were pounding.  ",3,1
"SCULLY: I'm trying. The, the sound is all screwed up. There was an alarm. Th, I remember, um... they wanted to know if I was all right.  ",3,1
SCULLY: I don't know.  ,3,1
SCULLY: I had to trust someone... I was powerless. I couldn't... I could not resist them.  ,3,1
SCULLY: No!  ,3,1
SCULLY: You came to see me today.  ,3,1
"SCULLY: You came to my apartment, I assumed you wanted to see me about something.  ",3,1
SCULLY: I saw you come out of my building.  ,3,1
SCULLY: Mrs. Mulder?  ,3,1
"SCULLY: I'm Dana Scully, I work with your son.  ",3,1
SCULLY: I think he's still alive.  ,3,1
SCULLY: I just have a very strong feeling.  ,3,1
SCULLY: About?  ,3,1
SCULLY: Who are you?  ,3,1
SCULLY: What kind of interests?  ,3,1
SCULLY: Threatened enough to murder?  ,3,1
SCULLY: What do you know about Mulder?  ,3,1
SCULLY: You're lying.  ,3,1
SCULLY: What are you here for?  ,3,1
SCULLY: Leave me alone.  ,3,1
SCULLY: You said there were two ways.  ,3,1
"SCULLY: Why, why kill me?  ",3,1
SCULLY: Why are you protecting me?  ,3,1
"SCULLY: You're not protecting me, you're protecting yourself.  ",3,1
SCULLY: What kind of business are you in?  ,3,1
SCULLY: Hello?  ,3,1
SCULLY: Hi.  ,3,1
"SCULLY: I, uh, I had to go to Boston... for a funeral.  ",3,1
SCULLY: Why?  ,3,1
"SCULLY: Missy, something strange happened to me today. I'm... I'm a bit freaked out by it.  ",3,1
"SCULLY: Yeah, yeah, I will.  ",3,1
SCULLY: Bye.  ,3,1
SCULLY: Hi.  ,3,1
"SCULLY: Missy, it's me. Please pick up.  ",3,1
SCULLY: I was just going over to my sister's.  ,3,1
SCULLY: Where are we going?  ,3,1
SCULLY: After you.  ,3,1
SCULLY: Take two steps forward.  ,3,1
SCULLY: I know why you're here. I want to know who sent you. Whose errand boy you are.  ,3,1
SCULLY: You got the rest of your life to give me answers.  ,3,1
"SCULLY: How high does it go, Skinner? Who's pulling the strings?  ",3,1
SCULLY: What's the alternative? Let you kill me now?  ,3,1
SCULLY: You're lying.  ,3,1
SCULLY: You're lying.  ,3,2
SCULLY: No way.  ,3,2
SCULLY: I said no! You're setting me up!  ,3,2
SCULLY: Then put your weapon down and sit down.  ,3,2
"SCULLY: You said you weren't here to kill me, Skinner, now prove it.  ",3,2
"SCULLY: Damn it, Skinner!  ",3,2
SCULLY: Yeah.  ,3,2
SCULLY: I was warned that somebody would kill me... someone I trusted.  ,3,2
SCULLY: Give me the tape.  ,3,2
SCULLY: Where?  ,3,2
"SCULLY: Mulder, I am...  ",3,2
SCULLY: I went to your father's funeral. I told your mother that you were going to be okay.  ,3,2
SCULLY: I just knew.  ,3,2
SCULLY: Do you recognize any of these men?  ,3,2
SCULLY: What did he do?  ,3,2
SCULLY: What would he be doing in a photo with your father?  ,3,2
SCULLY: Whatever happened to Klemper?  ,3,2
"SCULLY: What, what is it?  ",3,2
"SCULLY: I have to go there, Mulder.  ",3,2
SCULLY: That bullet was meant for me.  ,3,2
SCULLY: Those bastards...  ,3,2
SCULLY: Because it escaped you or because you escaped it?  ,3,2
SCULLY: History may be the only justice you'll ever know.  ,3,2
SCULLY: As a Nazi or for the blood money we paid you?  ,3,2
SCULLY: For a lot of innocent Jews.  ,3,2
"SCULLY: Yes, why?  ",3,2
SCULLY: What do you think your father would have been doing here?  ,3,2
"SCULLY: Mulder, take a look at this.  ",3,2
SCULLY: It's not working here either.  ,3,2
SCULLY: Positive. Napier's constant is the basis of all natural logarithms.  ,3,2
SCULLY: Mulder...  ,3,2
"SCULLY: You weren't even able to go to your father's funeral and if something in here were to cast doubt on the kind of man he was... I, I just know how it would affect me.  ",3,2
"SCULLY: Mulder, look at this.  ",3,2
"SCULLY: Of medical files, by the look of it. Got names... alphabetized.  ",3,2
SCULLY: Lots and lots of files.  ,3,2
"SCULLY: Standard medical forms. These are birth certificates, small pox vaccination certificate and then there's this.  ",3,2
"SCULLY: It's an old tissue collection cassette, the new ones are plastic.  ",3,2
"SCULLY: Yes, exactly.  ",3,2
SCULLY: 1955. All of these files are 1955.  ,3,2
"SCULLY: 1964, why?  ",3,2
SCULLY: You're looking for a file on me?  ,3,2
SCULLY: What?  ,3,2
SCULLY: That's your sister's file.  ,3,2
SCULLY: What are you looking for?  ,3,2
SCULLY: I don't understand.  ,3,2
"SCULLY: Mulder, where are you going?  ",3,2
SCULLY: Mulder!  ,3,2
"SCULLY: Mulder, I'm down here!  ",3,2
SCULLY: I heard gunshots.  ,3,2
SCULLY: What happened to you?  ,3,2
"SCULLY: I think there's a way out, down here.  ",3,2
SCULLY: What kind of deal?  ,3,2
SCULLY: An extremely elaborate filing system of medical records.  ,3,2
"SCULLY: I think we should let him make the deal, Mulder.  ",3,2
"SCULLY: Then what good are those answers to anybody but you, Mulder?  ",3,2
"SCULLY: Look, I want exactly what you want. But I need to see my sister.  ",3,2
SCULLY: I told Skinner to make the deal. But not to hand over the tape until you agree to it.  ,3,2
SCULLY: I just need to know if she's going to be okay.  ,3,2
SCULLY: Where's Victor Klemper?  ,3,2
SCULLY: Operation Paper Clip.  ,3,2
SCULLY: Mengele thought that he could produce a super-race through genetic engineering.  ,3,2
SCULLY: Like Victor Klemper?  ,3,2
"SCULLY: Mulder, wait.  ",3,2
"SCULLY: The technology wasn't there, Mulder. DNA wasn't even identified until 1944. This is all a lie.  ",3,2
"SCULLY: Mulder, this man is telling you everything that you want to hear but it's a fabrication, it is pure science fiction. There were no experiments with aliens.  ",3,2
"SCULLY: Like you said before, to protect yourself and the continuation of the Nazi agenda... human tests.  ",3,2
SCULLY: I don't know.  ,3,2
"SCULLY: Yes, but records of what, Mulder?  ",3,2
"SCULLY: It happened three hours ago. She went into surgery and, uh... the damage to her brain was worse than they had hoped.  ",3,2
SCULLY: You were right. There is no justice.  ,3,2
SCULLY: Then what is it about?  ,3,2
SCULLY: I need something to put my back up against.  ,3,2
"SCULLY: I've heard the truth, Mulder. Now what I want are the answers.  ",3,2
SCULLY: Both eardrums are ruptured. Cataracts over both eyes. Probably heat-induced.  ,3,3
"SCULLY: Well, there is extensive charring along the sternum with concomitant rib fractures consistent with electrocution or exposure to high voltage direct current. But I see no point of contact.  ",3,3
SCULLY: Did you find contact wounds on any of the other five victims?  ,3,3
SCULLY: Are you aware that something like 60 people die from lightning strikes across the country each year and five of those happened right here in Connerville?  ,3,3
"SCULLY: Yes, Im Agent Scully.  ",3,3
SCULLY: (not thrilled to be talking to this hostile Sheriff) These deaths match other cases of multiple fatalities attributed to lightning with the same inconclusive forensic evidence.  ,3,3
"SCULLY: Yes, I know a little.  ",3,3
"SCULLY: No, I didnt know that.  ",3,3
SCULLY: I dont understand.  ,3,3
SCULLY: I didnt know that either.  ,3,3
"SCULLY: With all due respect, sir, these autopsies dont quite add up.  ",3,3
SCULLY: Based on my opinion as a medical doctor.  ,3,3
"SCULLY: Well, since there is no other explanation right now, Id have to concur with the coroner that lightning is the most probable cause of death.  ",3,3
"SCULLY: (to MULDER, accusingly) Feel free to jump in anytime.  ",3,3
SCULLY: (sighs) Do you have a theory on whats going on here?  ,3,3
"SCULLY: Mulder, wait. What are you expecting to find here?  ",3,3
"SCULLY: (trying to keep up) Could you stop for a second, please? (MULDER stops and faces her) Look, after everything that weve just been through, after all that weve just seen, I hope youre not thinking this has anything to do with government conspiracies or UFOs.  ",3,3
"SCULLY: Well, what are you looking for? I mean, just because a forensic profile isnt cut and dried doesnt mean its not true.  ",3,3
SCULLY: The only possible scientific conclusion is that Jack Hammond was killed by lightning.  ,3,3
SCULLY: What are you talking about?  ,3,3
SCULLY: Police found Hammond in his car at 17 minutes past midnight. The entire electrical system was shorted out. All the circuitry and wiring had melted.  ,3,3
SCULLY: Get away from what?  ,3,3
SCULLY: (Checks notes) Sometime between 11:00 and 11:30. Why?  ,3,3
SCULLY: Excuse me.  ,3,3
SCULLY: Whats your name?  ,3,3
"SCULLY: Zero, do you mind if we talk for a minute?  ",3,3
SCULLY: Im with the FBI.  ,3,3
SCULLY: Were you working here last night?  ,3,3
SCULLY: Do you recognize this person? (holds up picture of JACK HAMMOND)  ,3,3
"SCULLY: Why dont you take a closer look. He was here between 11:00 and 11:30. He was killed in the parking lot. That was his car. So, if you were standing here at this counter you must have seen it happen.  ",3,3
SCULLY: Before the ambulance showed up did you notice anything unusual outside?  ,3,3
SCULLY: Did you notice anyone else around who might have seen something?  ,3,3
SCULLY: What?  ,3,3
"SCULLY: (looking at her notes) Uh Corey Huffard, Darren Oswald, Burke Roberts and Billy ---  ",3,3
SCULLY: Darren Peter. Why?  ,3,3
SCULLY: Yes.  ,3,3
SCULLY: Mulder.  ,3,3
SCULLY: Whats in your pocket?  ,3,3
SCULLY: What happened?  ,3,3
"SCULLY: What happened here, Sheriff?  ",3,3
SCULLY: Did they report lightning last night?  ,3,3
"SCULLY: Mulder, Id have to say I think hes right.  ",3,3
"SCULLY: Well, look at the evidence. What else could it be?  ",3,3
"SCULLY: Here we go. Well, considering its a partial imprint theres a lot of information here.  ",3,3
"SCULLY: (ignoring his joke, but with a smile) The tread looks like a standard military boot  mens  size 8½.  ",3,3
"SCULLY: Well, it says it right here on the bottom.  ",3,3
SCULLY: But I may have something even better. When I was cleaning the imprint to take the mold I found trace amounts of a viscous substance actually imbedded in the fulgurite.  ,3,3
"SCULLY: Id have to conduct a chemical analysis to be sure, but, uh  it looks like antifreeze.  ",3,3
SCULLY: But why? And how?  ,3,3
SCULLY: Mulder   ,3,3
SCULLY: Weve got a size match.  ,3,3
"SCULLY: Yeah, but it still doesnt prove that he killed Jack Hammond.  ",3,3
SCULLY: Im surprised you havent already read that issue.  ,3,3
SCULLY: Who is she?  ,3,3
SCULLY: Mm-hmm. theres a yearbook in Darrens closet.  ,3,3
SCULLY: Her name is Sharon Kiveat.  ,3,3
SCULLY: I just talked to one of the EMS workers. He was pretty rattled.  ,3,3
"SCULLY: Frank Kiveats electrocardiogram. (shows him) See that spike there? That indicates that some kind of electrical intervention started his heart. Except according to the EMS worker, the defibrillator wouldnt charge. The paddles were dead.  ",3,3
SCULLY: He didnt. All he saw was Darren Oswald touching Kiveats chest.  ,3,3
"SCULLY: (reading) He was admitted to the ER five months ago in cardiac arrest. Respiratory failure. Class three burns on the back of his skull  resuscitated after Hang on, this is odd. His blood test showed acute hypokalemia.  ",3,3
SCULLY: A severe chemical imbalance characterized by high sodium and low potassium levels.  ,3,3
SCULLY: Yeah.  ,3,3
"SCULLY: Well, among other things they generate the electrical impulses in our bodies. Like every time our heart beats or a neuron fires.  ",3,3
SCULLY: Our body doesnt work like that   ,3,3
SCULLY: Youre saying hes some kind of lightning rod?  ,3,3
"SCULLY: (hands up) We just want to talk to you, thats all. Just ask you a few more questions.  ",3,3
SCULLY: Why did you run when you saw us?  ,3,3
SCULLY: Were not so sure.  ,3,3
SCULLY: Not much. Except that hes a hero.  ,3,3
SCULLY: CPR. He claims he paid attention in health class.  ,3,3
SCULLY: How? By causing Kiveats heart attack?  ,3,3
SCULLY: So what? Are we supposed to charge him with assaulting a cellular phone?  ,3,3
"SCULLY: Mulder, look where we are. We dont have the capability or time to perform those tests. And without a confession we can only keep him in custody for 72 hours.  ",3,3
SCULLY: Is it okay if we come in?  ,3,3
SCULLY: How would you describe your relationship with him?  ,3,3
SCULLY: Did you get him the job at your husbands garage?  ,3,3
SCULLY: How did you know it was Darren?  ,3,3
"SCULLY: Well, you dont have to be afraid any more. You and your husband are safe as long as we can count on your testimony.  ",3,3
SCULLY: I believe that Darren Oswald was involved somehow in the deaths of those four people. And I believe it was irresponsible for you to let him go.  ,3,3
SCULLY: In effect.  ,3,3
"SCULLY: You said yourself, Sheriff, not even science can explain how lightning works.  ",3,3
SCULLY: Shes on her way to the hospital.  ,3,3
SCULLY: Sharon?  ,3,3
SCULLY: We need you to come with us right away.  ,3,3
"SCULLY: Look, we dont have much time. Come with us and well tell you everything.  ",3,3
"SCULLY: Sharon, please.  ",3,3
SCULLY: Hes dead.  ,3,3
SCULLY: How many other access points to this floor?  ,3,3
SCULLY: Mulder!  ,3,3
"SCULLY: (from behind, holding gun) Darren, dont move.  ",3,3
SCULLY: I said dont move. Darren.  ,3,3
SCULLY: Stop. Im warning you.  ,3,3
SCULLY: I want you step back inside that room.  ,3,3
"SCULLY: Shes not going anywhere with you, Darren.  ",3,3
SCULLY: I can hurt you too. Im going to give you three seconds. One   ,3,3
"SCULLY: Sharon, we can work this all out, right here.  ",3,3
SCULLY: I just got off the phone with the coroner. Hes ruling Tellers death accidental.  ,3,3
SCULLY: They also reported lightning last night. I talked to the DA. He has no idea how to begin building a case.  ,3,3
SCULLY: They came in five minutes ago.  ,3,3
"SCULLY: Nothing unusual was detected, Mulder. The electrolytes, the blood gas levels, brain wave activity. Based on the science of all the data thats been gathered   ",3,3
"SCULLY: No, nobody does anything without a reason. We've already composed a profile of the killer.  ",3,4
"SCULLY: Well, there's a possible connection with all of his victims being professional prognosticators.  ",3,4
SCULLY: I can't take you anywhere.  ,3,4
"SCULLY: It's too bad about your ""negative energy,"" Mulder, you missed quite a performance.  ",3,4
SCULLY: He said the killer doesn't feel in control of his own life but that's true of everyone at times.  ,3,4
"SCULLY: Might as well go home, Mulder, this case is as good as solved.  ",3,4
SCULLY: Who found the body?  ,3,4
"SCULLY: According to the police report, Mister Bruckman, you didn't touch the body after you found her.  ",3,4
"SCULLY: But you reported that you found a body with its eyes cut out. The body was face down. If you didn't move it, how did you know the eyes had been removed?  ",3,4
"SCULLY: Mister Bruckman, how much have you heard about the recent slayings in town?  ",3,4
SCULLY: How did you know about the entrails? That information hasn't been released to the press.  ,3,4
"SCULLY: I don't blame you, Mister Bruckman.  ",3,4
"SCULLY: This guy's performing the same routine as the Stupendous Yappi, he's just doing it in a different style.  ",3,4
"SCULLY: Oh, so now you're psychic?  ",3,4
SCULLY: So you can see into him but not at him.  ,3,4
SCULLY: Is he raping her?  ,3,4
"SCULLY: Mulder, the human mind naturally seeks meaningful patterns and configurations in things that don't inherently have any. Given the suggestion of a particular image, you can't help but see that shape somewhere. If that tank weren't there, you'd see it in a, in a rock or in a tree...  ",3,4
"SCULLY: Yes, it looks like a fat, little, white Nazi stormtrooper but that only proves my point.  ",3,4
"SCULLY: Mulder, that only implies that he was the one who put her in there.  ",3,4
SCULLY: I don't believe he's psychic.  ,3,4
SCULLY: Maybe he's just lucky.  ,3,4
SCULLY: I was told you were interrogating a suspect but something tells me...  ,3,4
SCULLY: Try reading this.  ,3,4
SCULLY: It was found on the woman that was pulled from the lake. Identical keychains were found on two of the other victims. I managed to trace the insignia to an investment firm called Uranus Unlimited. They provide market strategies based on astrological forecasts. And the company is owned by a man named...  ,3,4
"SCULLY: As far as I know, that's correct.  ",3,4
"SCULLY: In any case, we're trying to get a hold of him.  ",3,4
SCULLY: You get used to it.  ,3,4
SCULLY: You prognosticated Buddy Holly's death?  ,3,4
"SCULLY: Well, Mister Bruckman, I'm not one who readily believes in that kind of thing and if I was, I still wouldn't believe that story.  ",3,4
SCULLY: Where's the body?  ,3,4
"SCULLY: Yes, yes, we do.  ",3,4
SCULLY: Can you see him physically yet?  ,3,4
SCULLY: What? What do you see?  ,3,4
SCULLY: Who's it from?  ,3,4
"SCULLY: He must've been at the crime scenes, seeing you with us.  ",3,4
SCULLY: Studying background checks. This is what detective work is really like. We can't come up with suspects by having visions.  ,3,4
SCULLY: It's something you haven't explained. Can you see your own end?  ,3,4
SCULLY: Mister Bruckman... there are hits and there are misses. And then there are misses.  ,3,4
"SCULLY: So, Ahab mistakes the prophecy and as a result, dies. A similar fate happens to MacBeth.  ",3,4
SCULLY: That must be Mulder. Time for the midnight shift.  ,3,4
SCULLY: Chantilly lace?  ,3,4
"SCULLY: Mulder, it's not likely that the killer was wearing anything made out of chantilly lace at the time of the murders.  ",3,4
SCULLY: It's a coincidence.  ,3,4
"SCULLY: That's one to pose to the psychic philosopher. Good night, Mulder.  ",3,4
"SCULLY: Mulder, there's... are you okay?  ",3,4
SCULLY: Havez is going to stay with Bruckman while we go over to a tarot card reader around the corner. There's been another murder.  ,3,4
"SCULLY: Actually, I'm starting to feel more sympathetic towards him.  ",3,4
"SCULLY: Well, no, not really.  ",3,4
"SCULLY: But I am convinced that by thinking he can see the future, he's taken all the joy out of his life.  ",3,4
"SCULLY: Mulder, I found another strand of that silk.  ",3,4
SCULLY: It's the bellhop.  ,3,4
SCULLY: Havez?  ,3,4
SCULLY: Drop it!  ,3,4
SCULLY: I didn't. I got on the service elevator by mistake.  ,3,4
"SCULLY: You know, none of Bruckman's prophecy came true. The killer didn't get to him first, but he did kill Havez.  ",3,4
"SCULLY: Actually, I don't know. I couldn't find him.  ",3,4
"SCULLY: ""My neighbor, Mrs. Lowe, passed away last night. Please see that the remains of her remains are taken care of. Would you like a dog? He's paper-trained and well-behaved, regardless of his actions last night, which you can't really blame him for.""  ",3,4
SCULLY: He was put to death in the electric chair three days ago.  ,3,5
SCULLY: Third time's a charm. What's your interest in this?  ,3,5
"SCULLY: Well, reincarnation has always been popular on death row for obvious reasons.  ",3,5
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,3,5
SCULLY: Has a cause of death been determined?  ,3,5
SCULLY: I see the guards here wear panic devices. Was the victim's activated?  ,3,5
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,3,5
SCULLY: Warden?  ,3,5
SCULLY: The body. I think you should take a look. I suggest you get it into refrigeration or you're not gonna have anything left to autopsy.  ,3,5
SCULLY: Would it be possible to see the cell where the guard was murdered?  ,3,5
SCULLY: Did you know Neech Manley?  ,3,5
SCULLY: What was he like?  ,3,5
SCULLY: How is that?  ,3,5
SCULLY: Who do you think killed the guard?  ,3,5
SCULLY: Are you afraid at all?  ,3,5
SCULLY: Who are you?  ,3,5
SCULLY: I was just looking around.  ,3,5
SCULLY: Mulder. I'm ready to go now.  ,3,5
SCULLY: Guard!  ,3,5
SCULLY: I'm just ready to get out of here.  ,3,5
SCULLY: What did your preliminary exam turn up?  ,3,5
"SCULLY: From the eyewitness reports, there were already fly larvae infesting the flesh. That seems unusual considering the short time-of-death window.  ",3,5
SCULLY: In the anaerobic environment inside the paint can?  ,3,5
SCULLY: Hmmm. What was determined to be the cause of that death?  ,3,5
"SCULLY: Well, what if it saves three lives? Isn't that a deal worth making?  ",3,5
SCULLY: These aren't prisoners. These are guards you've got being murdered.  ,3,5
"SCULLY: I guess you'll be able to finish up that autopsy now, Scully.  ",3,5
SCULLY: He had quite a library.  ,3,5
SCULLY: Looks like Neech Manley knew his Bible.  ,3,5
SCULLY: What's that from?  ,3,5
SCULLY: Being obsessed with it doesn't mean you can do it.  ,3,5
SCULLY: Like what? The secret password?  ,3,5
"SCULLY: I'm sorry, Mulder, that's not what I learned in catechism.  ",3,5
SCULLY: Do you honestly believe that Neech Manley came back from the dead to kill those two men?  ,3,5
"SCULLY: A very good one, and one much more believable.  ",3,5
SCULLY: Or guards.  ,3,5
SCULLY: I only get five?  ,3,5
SCULLY: Because of his beliefs?  ,3,5
SCULLY: Did you catch her body language?  ,3,5
SCULLY: Of what? That her husband's gonna keep his word?  ,3,5
SCULLY: You mean she thinks she's on the list?  ,3,5
SCULLY: (to phone) Scully. We're on our way. (hangs up) (to Mulder) That was the warden. There's been another death.  ,3,5
SCULLY: Roque. They found him beaten to death in the showers on death row.  ,3,5
SCULLY: Who found the body?  ,3,5
SCULLY: Mulder.  ,3,5
"SCULLY: Oh, God. (she steps away as well)  ",3,5
"SCULLY: Mulder, can I have a minute?  ",3,5
SCULLY: I've just been going over Neech's phone calls over the last two months. Over 30 of them were made to a man named Danny Charez - twice as many as to his own wife.  ,3,5
SCULLY: Charez has been here three times to see Speranza since the first murder. He could be working with him on the outside.  ,3,5
"SCULLY: Okay then, what's your business with John Speranza?  ",3,5
SCULLY: What kind of deal?  ,3,5
SCULLY: You were Neech Manley's defense lawyer?  ,3,5
SCULLY: Why Neech's wife?  ,3,5
SCULLY: She has a boyfriend?  ,3,5
SCULLY: A woman gets lonely ... sometimes she can't wait around for a man to be reincarnated. I think we should notify the warden.  ,3,5
SCULLY: That's him. (reads the name) Parmelly.  ,3,5
SCULLY: Yes. I hadn't reported it but that same guard also cornered me and made an overture for prisoner Roque.  ,3,5
"SCULLY: Well, does it make sense to you that Parmelly is Neech's assassin?  ",3,5
"SCULLY: Well, according to an attorney we spoke to, he had brandished a gun at the residence.  ",3,5
SCULLY: A man named Charez. (the warden reacts) You know him?  ,3,5
"SCULLY: Well, he could be the fifth victim.  ",3,5
"SCULLY: She's got a gun on Parmelly. Center room, facing away.  ",3,5
SCULLY: Put it down! Put it down!  ,3,5
SCULLY: Why are we stopping?  ,3,5
SCULLY: What?  ,3,5
SCULLY: I thought we already went through this.  ,3,5
SCULLY: Then he was working with someone. They just haven't found out who.  ,3,5
SCULLY: To use fear as leverage for Roque's deal with the warden.  ,3,5
"SCULLY: I don't know. Maybe Parmelly wasn't sticking with the original plan. I'm sure this shacking up with Neech's wife wasn't part of it either, or maybe Neech's wife killing Parmelly was part of the plan from the beginning so that he'd take the truth to the grave with him.  ",3,5
"SCULLY: Well then, who did? Neech Manley?  ",3,5
"SCULLY: It's over, Mulder. Let's just go home.  ",3,5
SCULLY: Youre not sure?  ,3,6
SCULLY: Any indication what would have been the cause of death?  ,3,6
SCULLY: (covering for MULDER as usual) Well call you when we find anything else concrete.  ,3,6
SCULLY: Detective?  ,3,6
"SCULLY: Mulder, what do you think it is?  ",3,6
SCULLY: Disappeared?  ,3,6
"SCULLY: Mulder, what we just saw was not decomposition.  ",3,6
SCULLY: What about you? Where are you going?  ,3,6
"SCULLY: Its not a problem, is it?  ",3,6
"SCULLY: (businesslike, getting ready for work, snapping on the latex) Im not observing. Im performing it myself.  ",3,6
SCULLY: You sound surprised.  ,3,6
SCULLY: Why?  ,3,6
SCULLY: Old-fashioned?  ,3,6
SCULLY: (organizing instruments) Like this one?  ,3,6
"SCULLY: I appreciate your concern, Detective, but its not necessary. All I want to do is solve this case just like you.  ",3,6
SCULLY: Where would you like the autopsy report sent?  ,3,6
SCULLY: The date is august 29th. The time is 4:15 pm. The subjects name is Lauren MacKalvey. Caucasian. Female. Approximate time of death uncertain. Cause of death unknown.  ,3,6
SCULLY: (on phone) Scully.  ,3,6
SCULLY: (on phone) How do you know its the same guy?  ,3,6
"SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, Id like you to meet me at the coroners office as soon as you can.  ",3,6
SCULLY: (on phone) Theres not going to be an autopsy.  ,3,6
"SCULLY: Its a metacarpal from Lauren MacKalveys hand. In life, bones have the tensile strength of forged iron. Even in death, they remain strong. But look at this. (she squishes the finger with a clamp)  ",3,6
SCULLY: Its organic. Mostly hydrochloric acid similar to what is secreted by the gastric mugosa.  ,3,6
SCULLY: Almost identical only twice as acidic. I also found trace amounts of pepsin which is a digestive enzyme.  ,3,6
SCULLY: I dont know how else to explain such accelerated autolysis.  ,3,6
"SCULLY: In some broken-down form, yes.  ",3,6
SCULLY: (looks at him strangely) Missing?  ,3,6
SCULLY: I dont think so. (looks at chart) All the body tissues were accounted for . except there were extremely low almost trace amounts of adipose.  ,3,6
SCULLY: What weight discrepancy?  ,3,6
SCULLY: She probably lost weight since the license was issued.  ,3,6
"SCULLY: (stumped) What possible motivation could the killer have for removing his victims fatty tissue? I mean, who do you think were dealing with here?  ",3,6
SCULLY: (to MULDER) All of the air passages are blocked with what appears to be the same viscous hydrochloric acid we found on Lauren MacKalvey.  ,3,6
SCULLY: (crosses back to body) Heres something else that might help. The killer should have an identifiable wound pattern from this. (Shows HOOKERs broken and bloody fingernails.)  ,3,6
SCULLY: Good. We are expanding the search to include the faculty rosters from the local community colleges. We . oh . (sees MULDER enter) Excuse me.  ,3,6
SCULLY: Im almost done with the list.  ,3,6
"SCULLY: And? (MULDER hands her a folder) Well, it says here they didnt find a match.  ",3,6
"SCULLY: (reading) ""The second sample contains no oils or essential fatty acid."" Well, Mulder, there are any number of factors which could have caused that result. Where are you going with this?  ",3,6
SCULLY: From a dry skin sample youre concluding what? That hes some kind of fat-sucking vampire?  ,3,6
SCULLY: .which he ingests before the rest of the body dissolves entirely.  ,3,6
"SCULLY: Yes, scorpions predigest their food outside of their body by regurgitating onto their prey but I dont know too many scorpions who surf the internet.  ",3,6
"SCULLY: Id like to brief them, if thats okay with you.  ",3,6
SCULLY: Mr. Brenman? Im Special Agent Scully from the FBI. Would you mind if I asked you some questions? Thanks.  ,3,6
"SCULLY: (to tech) These are all University addresses. Chances are, he spent most of the morning on campus.  ",3,6
SCULLY: Cross hasnt checked in yet. Weve been trying his cell phone but theres no answer.  ,3,6
SCULLY: (on phone) He would have been by sometime this morning. Do you remember what time specifically? Could you describe him to me for verification? Excuse me a minute. (to MULDER) Did you find him?  ,3,6
SCULLY: Mulder  the landladys body --- We found her in the bathroom.  ,3,6
"SCULLY: I know this is hard to talk about right now, but I need you to tell me exactly what happened.  ",3,6
SCULLY: Your mothers perfume?  ,3,6
SCULLY: And you smelled it in his apartment?  ,3,6
SCULLY: He grabbed you?  ,3,6
SCULLY: What suitcase?  ,3,6
SCULLY: Did he say where?  ,3,6
"SCULLY: Okay, Jesse. That helps us. Im going to take a couple of minutes and go talk to Agent Mulder. Mrs. Sheperd is right here. Ill be right back. (starts to go)  ",3,6
SCULLY: Yeah?  ,3,6
"SCULLY: I dont know, Jesse.  ",3,6
SCULLY: What about employment records?  ,3,6
SCULLY: He told the girl he was on his way to New York.  ,3,6
SCULLY: What is it?  ,3,6
"SCULLY: Well, how are we going to track him?  ",3,6
SCULLY: Yeah.  ,3,6
SCULLY: And the bad news?  ,3,6
"SCULLY: You were right, Mulder. Theyre coming up empty at the airport. So Im releasing the sketch to the media. We still have time to make the morning papers.  ",3,6
"SCULLY: (pointing to computer readout) ""Friend?""  ",3,6
SCULLY: (Handing tech sketch of INCANTO) We need this scanned and sent to everyone on that list.  ,3,6
SCULLY: Im going to call the online service and have them fax us the telephone numbers of all those women.  ,3,6
"SCULLY: (on phone) Just lock your doors until we contact you again. Youll be fine, Miss Iniss. He doesnt tend towards forcible entry. (hangs up)  ",3,6
"SCULLY: Well, weve already contacted everyone on this list directly except for these two. (ELLEN is one of them) I left messages on their machines.  ",3,6
SCULLY: Mulder .  ,3,6
SCULLY: You go ahead. Ill stay here. Go.  ,3,6
"SCULLY: (dials phone) This is Federal Agent Dana Scully. I need an ambulance right away to 658 South Hudson Avenue, Apartment number 23. Request special chemical burn unit.  ",3,6
SCULLY: Why?  ,3,6
SCULLY: Youre more than a monster. You didnt just feed on their bodies. You fed on their minds.  ,3,6
SCULLY: Not anymore. (starts to go)  ,3,6
SCULLY: Let me out.  ,3,6
SCULLY: What did he start taking away?  ,3,7
SCULLY: And how did he do that?  ,3,7
SCULLY: Is something wrong?  ,3,7
"SCULLY: Excuse me, but is General Callahan the superior officer?  ",3,7
"SCULLY: Assuming we would want to investigate him, who would we talk to?  ",3,7
SCULLY: Whatever.  ,3,7
SCULLY: Well then we'd like to speak to him on our way out.  ,3,7
"SCULLY: Ask him to make himself available. Tell him that its our protocol. In the mean time, we'd like to finish up with Lt. Col. Stans. You never know when he might try to kill himself again.  ",3,7
"SCULLY: Let's finish this, Mulder.  ",3,7
"SCULLY: I would hope not, considering the extremity to Lt. Col. Stans' case.  ",3,7
"SCULLY: Yes, so we gathered. But his file is missing several interesting facts that came out of our interview with him.  ",3,7
SCULLY: Except for any mention of the death of his wife and two children in a house fire three months ago.  ,3,7
SCULLY: No doubt. But there is no record of any criminal or arson investigation.  ,3,7
"SCULLY: Not unlike Staff Sergeant Kevin Aiklen... isn't that correct, Sir?  ",3,7
"SCULLY: Six months ago, Aiklen also lost his family to a house fire. Afterwards he received psychiatric treatment for delusional behavior. Telling the doctors that he wanted to die, but that somebody wouldn't let him.  ",3,7
"SCULLY: That's your conclusion, General. But I'd hope you'll allow us the opportunity to come to our own.  ",3,7
SCULLY: No. I think he's got everything to hide.  ,3,7
"SCULLY: Mulder, I know this isn't what drew you to this case to begin with...  ",3,7
SCULLY: But I think it's very clear what's going on here.  ,3,7
"SCULLY: The general is protecting his men, but what he's protecting them from is prosecution for the murder of their families.  ",3,7
SCULLY: I don't know. But I can think of several good reasons.  ,3,7
SCULLY: That could be one.  ,3,7
"SCULLY: Considering the government's complete disavowment of Gulf War Syndrome, it's a pretty good reason to prevent our investigation.  ",3,7
SCULLY: But you're not buying it.  ,3,7
SCULLY: General Callahan...  ,3,7
"SCULLY: There are bruises around her neck and her shoulder, roughly the size of fingermarks.  ",3,7
SCULLY: The bruises and surrounding edema are consistent with a struggle. Will you be contacting her family?  ,3,7
SCULLY: I'm sorry. Truly.  ,3,7
"SCULLY: Mulder, you're serious?  ",3,7
SCULLY: That's not so hard to believe. Her screams would have been muffled underwater. There would be no fingerprints.  ,3,7
SCULLY: There's someone in the backyard.  ,3,7
"SCULLY: There was someone out here, I'm sure of it.  ",3,7
SCULLY: Look.  ,3,7
SCULLY: Find anything?  ,3,7
"SCULLY: Well, we've been a bit luckier. Whoever startled the General didn't just leave footprints... he left fingerprints as well.  ",3,7
"SCULLY: Forensics just lifted two matching indexes and a thumb. On the mailbox next to the front door, and one on the door leading into the backyard.  ",3,7
SCULLY: They're on the way to the NCIC as we speak.  ,3,7
SCULLY: FBI! Open the door!  ,3,7
"SCULLY: Mr. Freely, you are under arrest for suspicion of murder. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.  ",3,7
"SCULLY: If you want an attorney, we will get you one...  ",3,7
SCULLY: Captain Janet Draper... Staff Sergeant Kevin Aiklen... Lt. Col. Victor Stans...  ,3,7
"SCULLY: We've got him, Mulder.  ",3,7
"SCULLY: In addition to accessory to murder, you're looking at conspiracy, breaking and entering, commission of a felony on federal property...  ",3,7
"SCULLY: We know you weren't acting alone, Quentin. We know you had an accomplice.  ",3,7
SCULLY: If that's the man they call Rappo.  ,3,7
SCULLY: He's a suspect in two homicides.  ,3,7
SCULLY: How's that?  ,3,7
SCULLY: Damn it! He lied to us.  ,3,7
SCULLY: I don't know. I'm adding it to the list. Are you coming?  ,3,7
SCULLY: Not as worked up as I'm going to be.  ,3,7
SCULLY: Suffocation. The bed sheet was stuffed down his throat.  ,3,7
SCULLY: He did it all by himself.  ,3,7
SCULLY: Not likely?  ,3,7
SCULLY: Rappo?  ,3,7
"SCULLY: He can't even walk, let alone kill somebody.  ",3,7
SCULLY: I know. You've been walking around with that thing since we got here.  ,3,7
SCULLY: From what?  ,3,7
"SCULLY: What you're saying is this man, Rappo, is leaving his body and floating around town killing people?  ",3,7
SCULLY: Mulder... then why would he need Quintin Freely?  ,3,7
SCULLY: That's insane...  ,3,7
"SCULLY: You mean, messages recorded backwards in songs?  ",3,7
"SCULLY: Mr. Trimble, we'd like to ask you a few questions about Quinton Freely.  ",3,7
SCULLY: How's that?  ,3,7
SCULLY? What do you want to do?  ,3,7
SCULLY: No one's answering and the machine's not picking up.  ,3,7
SCULLY: General?  ,3,7
SCULLY: General?  ,3,7
SCULLY: He's having some kind of a seizure.  ,3,7
SCULLY: Nurse!  ,3,7
SCULLY: He's non responsive.  ,3,7
SCULLY: Come on.  ,3,7
SCULLY: Put him on monitors and prep the crash cart. He's going into cardiac arrest.  ,3,7
SCULLY: And make sure the team ...  ,3,7
SCULLY: Lt. Colonel!  ,3,7
"SCULLY: Get the keys, we have to open the door.  ",3,7
SCULLY: Open the door!  ,3,7
"SCULLY: Lt. Colonel, open the door!  ",3,7
SCULLY: Mulder.  ,3,8
SCULLY: We were delayed in DC. I tried you on your cell phone.  ,3,8
SCULLY: Your message said something about a kidnapping?  ,3,8
SCULLY: Is she here?  ,3,8
SCULLY: What are we doing here?  ,3,8
SCULLY: Incoherent speech.  ,3,8
"SCULLY: Well, thats spooky.  ",3,8
SCULLY: Are you feeling any better?  ,3,8
SCULLY: Does that mean anything to you?  ,3,8
SCULLY: Can you think of any reason why you might have said it?  ,3,8
SCULLY: Im sure as soon as your doctors feel its okay for you to go.  ,3,8
SCULLY: (to MULDER) I guess shes not too big on confined spaces.  ,3,8
SCULLY: Mulder I got something  something weird.  ,3,8
SCULLY: I was going over Lucy Householders medical work-up and something hit me. Her blood type is O-positive.  ,3,8
SCULLY: Forensics lifted two blood types off of her work clothes -- O-positive and B -positive. Two guesses as to what Amy Jacobs blood type is.  ,3,8
"SCULLY: I dont know, Mulder, but it begs the question.  ",3,8
SCULLY: Were not talking about the local population. Were talking about a woman who is tied to this case who had somebody elses blood on her uniform.  ,3,8
"SCULLY: Well, well know soon enough.  ",3,8
SCULLY: Im running a PCR on her blood to see if theres a DNA match.  ,3,8
SCULLY: Why?  ,3,8
"SCULLY: Mulder, Ive got a ----  ",3,8
SCULLY: Is that Lucy?  ,3,8
"SCULLY: Well, by most yardsticks, she hasnt, Mulder. (MULDER mutes the TV) Look, I think weve got a break in the case. A big one.  ",3,8
SCULLY: School pictures were mailed out this week to everyone in Amys class except Amy. One of Eubankss men discovered it.  ,3,8
"SCULLY: Its an outfit called Larken Scholastic. Now, the photographer checked out but his assistant was fired the day after the shoot  a man named Carl Wade.  ",3,8
"SCULLY: DMVs, and old address, but he spent the good part of the past 15 years institutionalized for a bipolar condition. The only thing current we have on him is this photo taken by his employer trying out a new camera.  ",3,8
SCULLY: Theyre doing it right now.  ,3,8
"SCULLY: Mulder, the blood on Lucys uniform was an exact DNA match. Lucy was covered in Amy Jacobs blood.  ",3,8
"SCULLY: Mulder, its incontrovertible evidence.  ",3,8
"SCULLY: (quietly, to MUDLER) I hate to say this, Mulder, but I think you just ran out of credibility.  ",3,8
SCULLY: (following) You are protecting her beyond the point of reason.  ,3,8
SCULLY: Did you consider for one minute that the person shes connected to is Carl Wade?  ,3,8
"SCULLY: For the same twisted reason that abused children crave their parents love or hostages develop sympathy for their captors. I mean, maybe Lucy developed some kind of emotional dependency.  ",3,8
SCULLY: It makes a lot more sense than the notion that shes bleeding Amy Jacobs blood.  ,3,8
"SCULLY: Mulder, you cant ----  ",3,8
"SCULLY: Then why did she run? If shes innocent, what was she running from?  ",3,8
"SCULLY: You dont see what youre doing, do you, Mulder? You are so close to this that you just dont see it.  ",3,8
"SCULLY: The extreme rationalization thats going on. Your personal identification with the victim, or in this case, the suspect. Youre becoming an empath yourself, Mulder. You are so sympathetic to Lucy as a victim like *your sister* that you cant see her as a person whos capable of committing this crime.  ",3,8
"SCULLY: But we already stick out like a sore thumb, Mulder. If we start canvassing Main Street somebodys going to pick up the phone to him.  ",3,8
SCULLY: Yeah.  ,3,8
SCULLY: (from trapdoor) Mulder!  ,3,8
SCULLY: Whats happening? Did you find her?  ,3,8
SCULLY: (to AGENT EUBANKS) Its all right.  ,3,8
SCULLY: (coming out of the house with other agents who get in cars) Mulder. They found Wades car north of here.  ,3,8
SCULLY: What?  ,3,8
SCULLY: But the rivers east and they found Wades car a mile north.  ,3,8
SCULLY: Did she tell you that?  ,3,8
"SCULLY: Mulder, wait!  ",3,8
SCULLY: (to AGENT KRESGE) Stay with her and get word to Eubanks that Wade may be heading towards the river.  ,3,8
SCULLY: One  two three. four.  ,3,8
SCULLY: One  two three. four.  ,3,8
SCULLY: two three. fourfive.  ,3,8
"SCULLY: Theres nothing. Mulder, its no good. Im sorry.  ",3,8
"SCULLY: Mulder, stop. You cant help her. Mulder. Its no use. Mulder. (puts her hands on his shoulders) Mulder, stop it. Stop it. Mulder, stop!  ",3,8
SCULLY: Mulder. Shes breathing.  ,3,8
"SCULLY: Yeah, we got her. We have to get an EMS unit here right away with some heat and some oxygen.  ",3,8
SCULLY: Its getting dark. We have to get her off the river.  ,3,8
"SCULLY: Shes exhausted, but it looks like shes going to be fine. The doctors want to keep her for a day or two just to be sure.  ",3,8
SCULLY: Wade must have left her alone. There were no injuries.  ,3,8
"SCULLY: I know, Mulder. I cant explain it. She didnt have a cut on her and nobody wants to talk about that right now. Everyones just relieved to have her back again  to have her safe.  ",3,8
"SCULLY: Yes. They, uh  they brought in the State Pathologist last night so I stopped by to get the autopsy reports on my way.  ",3,8
SCULLY: They found five liters of water in her lungs.  ,3,8
"SCULLY: Mulder (sits beside him on the bed) Whatever there was between them, you were part of that connection. Did you think about that? Lucy may have died for Amy, but without you, they never would have found her.  ",3,8
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,3,8
SCULLY: What are you watching?  ,3,9
SCULLY: That's not your usual brand of entertainment.  ,3,9
SCULLY: You spent money for this?  ,3,9
"SCULLY: Mulder, this is even hokier than the one they aired on the Fox network.  ",3,9
"SCULLY: Well, technically, I don't know why they would be wearing gas masks.  ",3,9
SCULLY: Olive oil? Snake oil? I suppose you think it's alien blood.  ,3,9
"SCULLY: I guess that begs the question, if this is an alien autopsy...  ",3,9
"SCULLY: Well, What do you want for twenty-nine ninety-five?  ",3,9
SCULLY: And this is real because it doesn't?  ,3,9
SCULLY: Who's selling these tapes?  ,3,9
SCULLY: Front door's been boarded up.  ,3,9
"SCULLY: Mulder, in here.  ",3,9
"SCULLY: Either they can't locate an interpreter, or the interpreter they located didn't interpret the instructions and got lost somewhere. I don't know which.  ",3,9
"SCULLY: Somehow, this is a tall request in Allentown this time of night.  ",3,9
"SCULLY: This is a surprise, sir.  ",3,9
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,3,9
SCULLY: What about the murder victim or the paperwork?  ,3,9
"SCULLY: I don't know, Mulder, it just doesn't track. What would a Japanese diplomat be doing in that house with a dead man with his head stuffed in a pillowcase?  ",3,9
"SCULLY: Well, what do you want to do now, drop it?  ",3,9
SCULLY: What are you doing?  ,3,9
SCULLY: What are those?  ,3,9
SCULLY: What would he be doing with a list of Mutual UFO Network members in the greater Allentown area with the name Betsy Hagopian circled?  ,3,9
SCULLY: What are you going to do?  ,3,9
"SCULLY: Hi, Betsy Hagopian?  ",3,9
SCULLY: Is there some way that I can get in touch with her?  ,3,9
"SCULLY: No, I think you must be mistaken.  ",3,9
"SCULLY: I'm, I'm afraid I'm not who you think I am.  ",3,9
SCULLY: One what?  ,3,9
"SCULLY: There must be some kind of mistake, I, I work for the F.B.I., and I'm here conducting a murder investigation.  ",3,9
SCULLY: A man named Steven Zinnzser was murdered about two miles from here.  ,3,9
SCULLY: Did you know him?  ,3,9
"SCULLY: But you understand, I'm, I'm not a member, I'm an F.B.I. agent.  ",3,9
"SCULLY: But at the door, you said that I was one of you.  ",3,9
SCULLY: Why did you ask me that?  ,3,9
"SCULLY: But I've never met any of you. I, I've never seen any of you before in my life.  ",3,9
"SCULLY: Taken? Uh, taken where?  ",3,9
SCULLY: I don't know.  ,3,9
SCULLY: What men?  ,3,9
"SCULLY: Yes, I'm...  ",3,9
SCULLY: I'm sorry. I don't think I'm ready to discuss this.  ,3,9
SCULLY: But why is it that I don't remember you?  ,3,9
SCULLY: How do you know that you're not mistaking me for somebody else?  ,3,9
SCULLY: What mark?  ,3,9
SCULLY: I really have to go.  ,3,9
"SCULLY: Yes. To see Betsy Hagopian. Why are you all at her house, where is she?  ",3,9
SCULLY: What's wrong with her?  ,3,9
SCULLY: And you think this is the result of her abduction experiences?  ,3,9
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,3,9
SCULLY: Why is the door locked?  ,3,9
SCULLY: Do you have any idea where I've been?  ,3,9
"SCULLY: I went to go see those MUFON members to find out about that woman, Betsy Hagopian.  ",3,9
SCULLY: I found out that she's dying along with a lot of other women who claim to be dying too.  ,3,9
"SCULLY: Am I? I don't know, Mulder. They, they, they said that they know me, that they've seen me before. It was freaky. They know things about me, about my disappearance.  ",3,9
SCULLY: What is this?  ,3,9
SCULLY: I've seen this man before.  ,3,9
"SCULLY: No, I... I've seen him before.  ",3,9
SCULLY: What are you doing with this?  ,3,9
"SCULLY: Yeah, but they were in full surgical dress, you couldn't tell one from the other.  ",3,9
SCULLY: Murdered for what?  ,3,9
"SCULLY: Well, murdered by whom?  ",3,9
SCULLY: Our government? For what possible reason?  ,3,9
"SCULLY: Mulder, that is still a fantasy.  ",3,9
"SCULLY: Believing's the easy part, Mulder. I just need more than you, I need proof.  ",3,9
SCULLY: What am I looking at?  ,3,9
SCULLY: Where did you get this?  ,3,9
SCULLY: Do you know what it is?  ,3,9
SCULLY: So you're saying that this is manmade?  ,3,9
SCULLY: Any way of finding out who manufactures it?  ,3,9
SCULLY: What are these chips used for?  ,3,9
SCULLY: How?  ,3,9
SCULLY: Yeah.  ,3,9
SCULLY: Scully.  ,3,9
SCULLY: Where are you?  ,3,9
SCULLY: I thought you said that it was our government's railroad.  ,3,9
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,3,9
SCULLY: Mulder...  ,3,9
SCULLY: Mulder...  ,3,9
"SCULLY: No, that's not where I know him from at all.  ",3,9
SCULLY: What are you doing here?  ,3,9
"SCULLY: No, why?  ",3,9
SCULLY: How do you know?  ,3,9
SCULLY: I don't know what you're talking about.  ,3,9
SCULLY: Why should I trust you? You've lied to us before.  ,3,9
"SCULLY: Mulder, don't get on the train.  ",3,9
SCULLY: Because they know where you are...  ,3,9
"SCULLY: Look, Mulder, it's just too dangerous.  ",3,9
SCULLY: Let it go.  ,3,9
"SCULLY: Mulder, don't get on the train.  ",3,9
SCULLY: Mulder? Answer me!  ,3,10
SCULLY: I want to know what's on that train.  ,3,10
"SCULLY: Our government is operating a secret railroad. They put something on that train in West Virginia, something living.  ",3,10
SCULLY: What the Japanese have to do with it. How a man named Ishimaru is involved.  ,3,10
"SCULLY: Don't tell me you don't know, you smug son of a b...  ",3,10
SCULLY: I don't have time for your convenient ignorance.  ,3,10
SCULLY: You know them too?  ,3,10
SCULLY: The implant.  ,3,10
SCULLY: Biological information?  ,3,10
SCULLY: But what?  ,3,10
SCULLY: Memory formation.  ,3,10
SCULLY: Like a computer hard drive.  ,3,10
SCULLY: You could know a person's every thought.  ,3,10
SCULLY: They've seen this technology before?  ,3,10
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,3,10
"SCULLY: It's Japanese, isn't it?  ",3,10
"SCULLY: Oh, it was just a guess.  ",3,10
"SCULLY: Well done, Agent Pendrell. Keep up the good work.  ",3,10
SCULLY: Hey!  ,3,10
SCULLY: Who are you? Don't worry. I'm not going to hurt you. I'm an FBI agent.  ,3,10
SCULLY: What kind of facility?  ,3,10
SCULLY: Hansen's Dis... do you mean this is a leper colony?  ,3,10
"SCULLY: L, look. I, I, I came here looking for a Doctor Shiro Zama.  ",3,10
SCULLY: Where did they go?  ,3,10
SCULLY: What death squads?  ,3,10
SCULLY: How many have been killed?  ,3,10
"SCULLY: I don't understand how there could have been hundreds of people here when, when leprosy is supposed to be a treatable disease.  ",3,10
SCULLY: Who were the others?  ,3,10
SCULLY: And they had Hansen's disease?  ,3,10
"SCULLY: Oh, my God... oh...  ",3,10
SCULLY: Wait! Hey!  ,3,10
SCULLY: How did you know my name?  ,3,10
SCULLY: What are you talking about?  ,3,10
SCULLY: Who are you? What is this place?  ,3,10
SCULLY: I've seen your methods of elimination. What happened to the man who was with me in the forest? What about the people who were in this room?  ,3,10
SCULLY: Exposed to what?  ,3,10
"SCULLY: You mean Ishimaru. You hid him here after the war. He stayed here, and he continued his experiments.  ",3,10
SCULLY: What was he exposing these people to?  ,3,10
SCULLY: What kinds of things?  ,3,10
SCULLY: Who knows?  ,3,10
"SCULLY: Mulder, it's me.  ",3,10
SCULLY: I'm in West Virginia.  ,3,10
"SCULLY: Mulder, we've gotten involved in something, but it's not at all what you think.  ",3,10
SCULLY: Whatever is on that train is not alien.  ,3,10
"SCULLY: Mulder, Ishimaru Zama...  ",3,10
SCULLY: The leper colony was just a front. The tests weren't just on lepers. They were on the homeless...  ,3,10
SCULLY: The man who handed me the phone.  ,3,10
SCULLY: Because of what he's shown me.  ,3,10
"SCULLY: Mulder, I'm standing in a train car just like the one in your alien autopsy video... only I realize that I've been here before.  ",3,10
"SCULLY: This is where they brought me, Mulder. This is where they put the implant in my neck, in one of these cars.  ",3,10
"SCULLY: It all makes sense, Mulder. Ishimaru Zama, he was using the secret railroad...  ",3,10
SCULLY: Can you hear me?  ,3,10
"SCULLY: What I am saying, Mulder, is that there is no such thing as alien abduction.  ",3,10
SCULLY: That wasn't a...  ,3,10
"SCULLY: Because I have what I told you I needed, Mulder... proof. Two weeks ago, the president made a public apology for secret radiation tests that had been conducted on innocent citizens up until 1974.  ",3,10
"SCULLY: Mulder, listen to me. You have got to stay out of that train car.  ",3,10
SCULLY: Because there is a bomb on board.  ,3,10
"SCULLY: Well, then we've got to get you out of there. 'Cause that device is on a timer.  ",3,10
SCULLY: There should be...  ,3,10
"SCULLY: Did you find it, Mulder?  ",3,10
SCULLY: How much time do you have?  ,3,10
"SCULLY: Look, Mulder, you've got to get them to stop that train so we can get you off of it.  ",3,10
SCULLY: So we can get a bomb squad out there.  ,3,10
SCULLY: Did you hear that?  ,3,10
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,3,10
SCULLY: Mul...  ,3,10
SCULLY: It's not on the map.  ,3,10
SCULLY: Scully.  ,3,10
"SCULLY: Damn it, Mulder, what happened?  ",3,10
"SCULLY: Yeah, I figured that, do you have any idea where you are?  ",3,10
"SCULLY: Mulder, if I'm right, they're not going to want to find you... but you don't think I'm right, do you?  ",3,10
"SCULLY: We're not waiting for anything, Mulder, we got to get you...  ",3,10
"SCULLY: Yes, hello, my name is Dana Scully and I'm trying to reach Senator Matheson at home. I've already tried him at his office. Please, this is an emergency, can you reach him? Yes, I'm at, uh, 555-0199. Thanks. This area code.  ",3,10
SCULLY: Mulder? I think I've got something here.  ,3,10
SCULLY: I think I may have a code for you.  ,3,10
SCULLY: Your alien autopsy video.  ,3,10
"SCULLY: I've got six minutes left, is that what you have?  ",3,10
SCULLY: One.  ,3,10
"SCULLY: Yeah, yeah. One, zero, one.  ",3,10
SCULLY: And a three... then a three...  ,3,10
SCULLY: Uh... I can't see the last number clearly. His hand gets in the way.  ,3,10
"SCULLY: I know, I'm sorry, um... I think it's a one.  ",3,10
"SCULLY: Yeah, yeah, I'm pretty sure.  ",3,10
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,3,10
SCULLY: Are there any satellite photos you can get your hands on?  ,3,10
"SCULLY: Well, the administrator at the hospital where you were admitted said that someone had called and alerted them to your location. Now, I went through the phone records myself, and the call was placed from a phone booth in Blue Earth, Iowa.  ",3,10
SCULLY: Yeah. I got it right here.  ,3,10
"SCULLY: It's the one they gave me, the one they said you gave to the conductor.  ",3,10
SCULLY: Mulder...  ,3,10
"SCULLY: They've gotten away with it, Mulder. The bodies at the leper colony have all been removed.  ",3,10
SCULLY: And I know what I saw at that research facility. It was barely recognizable as human.  ,3,10
"SCULLY: These ligature marks on his neck are consistent with rope or fabric burns - strongly suggesting that he was strangled, but there seems to be an awful lot of blood loss here.  ",3,11
SCULLY: Stigmata?  ,3,11
SCULLY: I don't see any wounds here on his hands or wrists or otherwise.  ,3,11
SCULLY: What are you doing?  ,3,11
SCULLY: Others?  ,3,11
"SCULLY: According to certain religious lore, at any given time there are twelve stigmatics in the world, representing the twelve apostles.  ",3,11
SCULLY: Eleven? Any clue as to the motivation?  ,3,11
"SCULLY: Well, that narrows down the field.  ",3,11
SCULLY: You said on the phone that there had been a previous incident.  ,3,11
SCULLY: Was that the case?  ,3,11
SCULLY: How's he doing?  ,3,11
"SCULLY: Hi, Kevin. My name is Dana Scully. Can I talk to you a minute?  ",3,11
"SCULLY: We don't know just yet. Right now, we have to find out what happened. Can you tell me how you got those cuts on your hands?  ",3,11
"SCULLY: No, you can't tell me, or no, you don't know?  ",3,11
SCULLY: I don't want you to say anything that isn't true.  ,3,11
SCULLY: He feels a bit feverish. Did you take his temperature?  ,3,11
"SCULLY: You're a very brave boy, Kevin. You have nothing to be afraid of.  ",3,11
SCULLY: I don't know.  ,3,11
"SCULLY: The kid's hands were definitely cut, Mulder.  ",3,11
SCULLY: Have you determined how his hands were cut?  ,3,11
SCULLY: Maybe we should talk to his father.  ,3,11
SCULLY: His father said that he needed to be protected. Maybe he knows from whom.  ,3,11
SCULLY: Yes. How did you know that?  ,3,11
SCULLY: Armageddon?  ,3,11
SCULLY: Full circle to find the truth? I don't know what that means.  ,3,11
SCULLY: Kevin was abducted from this room. Several of the children witnessed it. We're getting a description of the man who took him.  ,3,11
SCULLY: Did you get a composite?  ,3,11
"SCULLY: This isn't the killer, Mulder.  ",3,11
"SCULLY: No, I mean it doesn't match the MO. None of the previous victims were ever abducted.  ",3,11
SCULLY: You know this man?  ,3,11
SCULLY: Kevin?  ,3,11
"SCULLY: If it's not you, then who is it?  ",3,11
"SCULLY: Mr. Jarvis, my religious convictions are hardly the issue here.  ",3,11
SCULLY: Don't!  ,3,11
SCULLY: You'll be OK. You'll be OK.  ,3,11
"SCULLY: Owen Lee Jarvis, adult caucasion male. 42 years of age. Cause of death is strangulation, consistent with previous victims, as suggested by burn marks around his neck. Except ... (she examines an area with a magnifying glass) There appears to be some kind of a pattern just to the right of his windpipe, possibly a hand print. Note to the lab to check further. It is now 14 hours after the time of death, but so far his body hasn't even begun to break down. (She examines his hand) Rigor mortis has yet to set in. His core body temperature remains at 98 degrees. His skin color, lividity is healthy. (she holds his hand close to her nose) There seems to be some ...  ",3,11
"SCULLY: (slightly strained voice) Mulder, would you do me a favor? Would you smell Mr. Jarvis?  ",3,11
SCULLY: You don't detect a faint floral odor?  ,3,11
"SCULLY: Mulder, this man's body is in no way decomposing normally. In catechism, we learned of instances like this - so-called ""incorruptibles"", whose bodies wouldn't decay and who emitted a smell of flowers.  ",3,11
"SCULLY: St. Cecilia, St. Francis ...  ",3,11
SCULLY: I don't know.  ,3,11
"SCULLY: Well, what do you think this is?  ",3,11
"SCULLY: Well, isn't a saint or a holy person just another term for someone who's abnormal?  ",3,11
"SCULLY: I ... believe in the idea that God's hand can be witnessed. I believe He can create miracles, yes.  ",3,11
SCULLY: Maybe that's just what faith is.  ,3,11
SCULLY: Got your message. What did you turn up?  ,3,11
SCULLY: What?  ,3,11
SCULLY: Any evidence as to how the killer managed to do that?  ,3,11
SCULLY: A powerful and respected man.  ,3,11
SCULLY: Israel?  ,3,11
"SCULLY: Yeah, it's when people who visit the Holy Land suffer religious delusions induced by the journey.  ",3,11
"SCULLY: Yeah, but it still doesn't explain how he was able to burn his fingerprints into Owen Jarvis' flesh.  ",3,11
"SCULLY: It's Kevin, isn't it?  ",3,11
"SCULLY: It was an accident, Kevin. Your mother was only trying to protect you.  ",3,11
SCULLY: I don't know. But I won't let him hurt you. I promise.  ,3,11
"SCULLY: How are you different, Kevin? (he doesn't answer) Kevin?  ",3,11
SCULLY: Agent Mulder and I are gonna take you back to the shelter. There'll be a doctor to take a look at you there.  ,3,11
"SCULLY: No ... No, you don't. Why don't you duck back inside.  ",3,11
"SCULLY: I want to keep him with us, Mulder, until Gates is apprehended. (Mulder stares at her) Look, I know about getting personally involved and I'm not.  ",3,11
SCULLY: Yes.  ,3,11
SCULLY: I'll wait right outside.  ,3,11
SCULLY: Kevin has a cut under his ribs.  ,3,11
"SCULLY: No, I ... I was with the paramedics when they were looking at him. It wasn't there.  ",3,11
"SCULLY: No, Mulder, I was paying close attention.  ",3,11
"SCULLY: Yesterday, I saw Kevin's hands. They were bleeding from identical wounds on the top as on the bottom ... just like in the crucifixion.  ",3,11
"SCULLY: There have been other signs. I haven't said anything until now, because I haven't been sure ... and I'm still not sure.  ",3,11
SCULLY: How Kevin was able to be in two places at once ... just like St. Ignatius was able to do in the Bible.  ,3,11
"SCULLY: How is it that you're able to go out on a limb whenever you see a light in the sky, but you're unwilling to accept the possibility of a miracle? Even when it's right in front of you.  ",3,11
"SCULLY: Well, what about what I've seen?  ",3,11
SCULLY: Kevin? You OK? (she tries the door but it's locked) (to Mulder) I didn't lock it.  ,3,11
"SCULLY: I wasn't out of that room for more than two minutes, Mulder. Come on, there's someone I want to talk to again.  ",3,11
SCULLY: Kevin's father.  ,3,11
SCULLY: He knew that Kevin was in danger. He warned us about a powerful and respected man.  ,3,11
SCULLY: Maybe he is.  ,3,11
"SCULLY: Well, it's not doing us a lot of good standing around here.  ",3,11
SCULLY: You've never seen him before?  ,3,11
SCULLY: You really don't know?  ,3,11
SCULLY: Haloperidol. It's a powerful anti-psychotic. They've increased his dosage. Mr. Kryder? You said something before about coming full circle to find the truth. What does it mean? Full circle to find the truth?  ,3,11
"SCULLY: Mulder, look. Arrows that form a circle. Full circle to find the truth. Gates' company owns a recycling plant near here. That's where he's taken Kevin.  ",3,11
"SCULLY: I don't think so, Mulder.  ",3,11
"SCULLY: I don't know. Look, if I'm wrong, I'll meet you out at the airport. OK?  ",3,11
"SCULLY: Stop! Federal agent, I'm armed! Let him go! Let him go and we'll talk about it!  ",3,11
SCULLY: No!  ,3,11
SCULLY: Kevin! Hold on! Hold on!  ,3,11
SCULLY: You all set?  ,3,11
SCULLY: Maybe I'll see you again sometime.  ,3,11
"SCULLY: Yeah, I think so.  ",3,11
"SCULLY: I'd appreciate it if you'd handle that alone, Mulder. I have an errand I need to run.  ",3,11
SCULLY: I'll see you at the airport.  ,3,11
"SCULLY: Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been six years since my last confession, and since then I've drifted away from the church. I'm not sure why exactly.  ",3,11
"SCULLY: No, um, there's a man that I work with - a friend - and usually I'm able to discuss these things with him ... but not this. Father, do you believe in miracles?  ",3,11
"SCULLY: No, I'm talking about events that defy explanation. Things that ... I believe helped me to save a young boy's life. But now I wonder if I saw them at all. If I didn't just imagine them.  ",3,11
SCULLY: Because my partner didn't see them. He didn't ... he didn't believe them. And usually he ... he believes without question.  ,3,11
SCULLY: Is that possible?  ,3,11
SCULLY: To find my way back?  ,3,11
"SCULLY: Mostly, it just makes me afraid.  ",3,11
SCULLY: Afraid that God is speaking ... but that no one's listening.  ,3,11
"SCULLY: Mulder, where have you been? I've been trying to reach you all day.  ",3,12
SCULLY: Visiting your mother?  ,3,12
"SCULLY: Mulder, I think the only thing more fortuitous than the emergence of life on this planet is that, through purely random laws of biological evolution, an intelligence as complex as ours ever emanated from it.  ",3,12
"SCULLY: Yeah, well, don't look too hard. You might not like what you find.  ",3,12
SCULLY: And look what happened.  ,3,12
"SCULLY: Wait... Mulder, what's going on?  ",3,12
SCULLY: Hello?  ,3,12
SCULLY: What is it?  ,3,12
SCULLY: I'm not going to ask you if you just said what I think you just said because I know it's what you just said.  ,3,12
SCULLY: Where are you again?  ,3,12
SCULLY: Were there insect bites on the body?  ,3,12
"SCULLY: 'Cause you know, Mulder, millions of people are actually allergic to cockroaches. There have been reported cases of fatal reactions. It's called, uh, anaphylactic shock.  ",3,12
"SCULLY: Mm-hmm. Many such reactions have occurred to entomologists or, uh, exterminators.  ",3,12
SCULLY: You still want me to come up?  ,3,12
SCULLY: Stay.  ,3,12
SCULLY: Another roach attack?  ,3,12
SCULLY: Are there still insects in the body?  ,3,12
SCULLY: From the cockroaches?  ,3,12
"SCULLY: Well, was there any evidence of drug use at the crime scene?  ",3,12
"SCULLY: You know, Mulder, there's a psychotic disorder associated with some forms...  ",3,12
"SCULLY: The victim cuts himself in, in an attempt to extract the imaginary insect.  ",3,12
SCULLY: It's no bother. Bye.  ,3,12
SCULLY: Who died now?  ,3,12
SCULLY: A toilet? Check his eyes.  ,3,12
SCULLY: It's probably a brain aneurysm.  ,3,12
SCULLY: Straining too forcefully is very common causation for bursting a brain aneurysm.  ,3,12
SCULLY: Did you catch any?  ,3,12
"SCULLY: I don't know what to tell you, Mulder. I just hope you're not implying you've come across an infestation of killer cockroaches.  ",3,12
SCULLY: Mulder? I've been doing some research.  ,3,12
"SCULLY: No, but they do exhibit behavior different than our domestic breeds.  ",3,12
SCULLY: I'm suggesting that what's happening out there might be the introduction to this country of a new species of cockroach...  ,3,12
"SCULLY: Mulder, you're not thinking about trespassing onto government property again, are you?  ",3,12
"SCULLY: Well, what's going on? What do you see?  ",3,12
SCULLY: What does the place look like?  ,3,12
SCULLY: Moving walls?  ,3,12
SCULLY: What?!  ,3,12
"SCULLY: Mulder, you've got to get out of there right now!  ",3,12
SCULLY: Are you all right? What happened?  ,3,12
"SCULLY: Mulder, what's going on?  ",3,12
SCULLY: Mulder! Mulder!  ,3,12
"SCULLY: Mulder, are you okay?  ",3,12
SCULLY: What happened at the U.S.D.A. site?  ,3,12
SCULLY: Did he give you any idea of how to catch them?  ,3,12
SCULLY: She?  ,3,12
SCULLY: Did you know the inventor of the flush toilet was named Thomas Crapper?  ,3,12
SCULLY: Who?  ,3,12
SCULLY: Her name is Bambi?  ,3,12
SCULLY: Her name is Bambi?  ,3,12
"SCULLY: Yeah, sure, okay.  ",3,12
"SCULLY: You know, lots of people are afraid of insects, Mulder. It's just a... it's a natural, instinctive.  ",3,12
SCULLY: A praying mantis?  ,3,12
SCULLY: Mulder...  ,3,12
SCULLY: Mul... no...  ,3,12
SCULLY: What happened now?  ,3,12
"SCULLY: Mulder, I'm coming up there right now.  ",3,12
SCULLY: Two cases of anaphylactic shock...  ,3,12
"SCULLY: Regardless, Mulder, something strange is definitely going on up there.  ",3,12
SCULLY: I still haven't been able to explain the cockroaches at all the sites.  ,3,12
SCULLY: Metal? What are you talking about? Mulder?  ,3,12
"SCULLY: Excuse me, do you sell road maps?  ",3,12
SCULLY: What's going on here?  ,3,12
SCULLY: Have you seen any of cockroaches yourself?  ,3,12
SCULLY: All right.  ,3,12
"SCULLY: Mulder, this town is insane.  ",3,12
"SCULLY: I'm in a convenience store on the outskirts of, uh...  ",3,12
SCULLY: He has an import license...  ,3,12
"SCULLY: Mulder, I think you've been in this town too long.  ",3,12
SCULLY: Let me guess... Bambi.  ,3,12
SCULLY: No... this is no place for an entomologist.  ,3,12
SCULLY: Mulder? Mulder!  ,3,12
SCULLY: Mulder!  ,3,12
SCULLY: There were others?  ,3,12
"SCULLY: Yeah, that would explain everything.  ",3,12
SCULLY: Smart is sexy.  ,3,12
SCULLY: The map says to turn right at the intersection.  ,3,13
SCULLY: At the intersection?  ,3,13
"SCULLY: This isnt a stoplight, its a stop sign.  ",3,13
SCULLY: A turn right.  ,3,13
SCULLY: Based on what evidence?  ,3,13
SCULLY: And you have physical evidence of these rituals being conducted?  ,3,13
SCULLY: So you have nothing concrete to connect these things to Satanists.  ,3,13
"SCULLY: (irritated) Our research has proven that most of these accounts are false or imagined. That, eh, the trauma or mental illness that is often linked to satanic cults is a result of denial, hysteria and misplaced blame.  ",3,13
SCULLY: Who interviewed them?  ,3,13
SCULLY: Together or separate?  ,3,13
"SCULLY: Well, then you have no way of determining whether or not the stories are fabricated.  ",3,13
"SCULLY: Let me guess, they told you about a wild beast entering in on a black mass, the drinking of blood, the sacrifice of an infant,or a blonde virgin.  ",3,13
SCULLY: Where is she going?  ,3,13
SCULLY: I doubt shes even a blonde.  ,3,13
"SCULLY: Yeah, could you tell me again exactly what happened the night of Jay Debooms death?  ",3,13
SCULLY: How did you know they were up to no good?  ,3,13
"SCULLY: I dont suppose there have been any actual reports of stolen infants, or mass graves being uncovered anywhere in town, or that you found an alter, or any other evidence of a black mass?  ",3,13
"SCULLY: The problem is, that the details of these accounts could have been taken from any newspaper or magazine. As horrific as they sound, the stories that these girls told are common, even cliché.  ",3,13
"SCULLY: There have been incidents where the embalming fluid used to preserve the body have caused chemical reactions and produced heat and burning, I, I see nothing here that would suggest otherwise.  ",3,13
SCULLY: Whats what?  ,3,13
SCULLY: A horned beast?  ,3,13
SCULLY: I think you guys are seeing something that isnt there.  ,3,13
"SCULLY: No, I dont see the horns right there. (Snaps on surgical glove)  ",3,13
"SCULLY: Sure, fine. (Snaps on other glove.) Whatever.    ",3,13
SCULLY: What happened?  ,3,13
SCULLY: (TO MULDER: ) You werent in your motel room.  ,3,13
SCULLY: I see.  ,3,13
"SCULLY: Look, weve been working together for, what, two years now? We have different opinions, but I didnt expect you to ditch me.  ",3,13
"SCULLY: Fine, whatever.  ",3,13
"SCULLY: This is called rumor panic. Its when XXX that links up with a popular satanic cult myth and an increase of attention in a community. A villain or villains are singled out as the focus of the communitys confusion and angst about unexplained events, like the death of the high school boys. There have been at least twenty incidents since 1983 from upstate New York to Reno, Nevada and not one of them has turned up a single shred of evidence to support the wild allegations.  ",3,13
"SCULLY: Allright, everybody, stay back!  ",3,13
"SCULLY: No, you go ahead.  ",3,13
SCULLY: (reads) R. W. G.  ,3,13
"SCULLY: (Sigh, looks up (probably thinking: Im tired of all this/not again.))    ",3,13
"SCULLY: You can go now dr. Godfrey, I dont think well be needing you any further. Your story checked out.  ",3,13
"SCULLY: The bones, turned out to be the skeletal remains not of an infant, but of a beloved, fourteen year old [lasa apso], formerly known as (holds out collar) Mr. Tippy.  ",3,13
SCULLY: Can I have a word with you?  ,3,13
SCULLY: This has gone on far enough.  ,3,13
"SCULLY: I am not going to be humiliated by you, in front of you, or by having to bring a teenage girl in, on her birthday of all days, to identify the bones of her dead dog, Mr. Tippy!  ",3,13
"SCULLY: I see no reason to pursue this case any further and not only that, I find your conduct and comportment in this investigation not just alarming, but highly objectionable. What are you doing?!  ",3,13
"SCULLY: If thats the reason were sticking around, thats your business. (Walks away.)  ",3,13
SCULLY: Detective White.  ,3,13
"SCULLY: Well, you two seem to have a certainsimpatico. Im going back to Washington in the morning.  ",3,13
SCULLY: Mu (sees them). Theres been another death.  ,3,13
SCULLY: A high school girl was impaled by flying glass from a bathroom mirror. (Opens door on drivers side)  ,3,13
SCULLY: Im driving.  ,3,13
SCULLY: I didnt see anything anyway. (Sits down.)  ,3,13
SCULLY: Im driv Why do you always have to drive? Because youre the guy? Because youre the big macho-man?  ,3,13
"SCULLY: I dunno what you think youre doing, but I suggest you put that gun down, sir, or Im gonna have to arrest you.  ",3,13
"SCULLY: You cant go walking down the middle of a street carrying a loaded weapon, it is against the law.  ",3,13
SCULLY: There are no Satanists here.  ,3,13
"SCULLY: Why didnt you stop her Terri, why didnt you tell anybody?  ",3,13
SCULLY: (phone rings) Scully  ,3,13
"SCULLY: (oh great look on her face, gets in car) Where are you?  ",3,13
"SCULLY: Im way ahead of you, Mulder. Ive got a suspect I wanna bring in.  ",3,13
SCULLY: Margi Kleinjan.  ,3,13
"SCULLY: Thats right, her friend just gave us a statement.  ",3,13
SCULLY: Who?  ,3,13
"SCULLY: Well, actually Im way ahead of you, Mulder, because Im with Terri right now.  ",3,13
SCULLY: Ive got your suspect and youve got mine. Why does that make sense to me at this point?  ,3,13
SCULLY: (no reaction)  ,3,13
"SCULLY: Sure, fine, whatever. (turns phone off)  ",3,13
SCULLY: What the hell is going on here?  ,3,13
SCULLY: Gladly. (steps aside)  ,3,13
SCULLY: You ready?  ,3,13
SCULLY: (no reaction)  ,3,13
SCULLY: (no reaction)  ,3,13
"SCULLY: (no reaction, goes straight over intersection)  ",3,13
"SCULLY: Shut up, Mulder.  ",3,13
SCULLY: He was arrested last week for the murders of at least seven men.  ,3,14
SCULLY: Was there a signature or a defining MO?  ,3,14
SCULLY: Both eyes punctured... signature gashes from the corners of the mouth to the ears.  ,3,14
SCULLY: The level of violence and overkill here would suggest the work of a very angry individual.  ,3,14
"SCULLY: Well, possession is a common claim by criminals who have dissociative disorders. It's how they... distance themselves from their actions.  ",3,14
SCULLY: A copy cat?  ,3,14
"SCULLY: You have a nice soft bunk, sir. Why aren't you using it?  ",3,14
SCULLY: Or maybe it's just the name of your accomplice.  ,3,14
SCULLY: You killed all those young men yourself?  ,3,14
"SCULLY: Well, its fingerprints weren't on the murder weapon, yours were. And it won't be tried for seven murders under the death penalty.  ",3,14
"SCULLY: Is that was it did last night, John? Snapped its fingers and let another young man die?  ",3,14
"SCULLY: Yes, I know. Behavioral Science... You wrote the book. It's a honor, sir.  ",3,14
"SCULLY: No, not at all, sir.  ",3,14
SCULLY: You're not going to tell me when your love affair with Patterson ended?  ,3,14
SCULLY: I thought you were considered his fair-haired boy when you joined the bureau.  ,3,14
SCULLY: Why not?  ,3,14
SCULLY: You mean you couldn't worship him.  ,3,14
"SCULLY: Well, from what I hear, there are a lot of men who did. A lot of men joined the FBI because they wanted to be him.  ",3,14
"SCULLY: By the looks of this, I'd say that served him pretty well.  ",3,14
SCULLY: I thought it was one of those pictures coming to life.  ,3,14
SCULLY: One of our guys must have locked it in here.  ,3,14
SCULLY: It's a door.  ,3,14
SCULLY: Why don't you wait until we can get some more light in here?  ,3,14
SCULLY: (off screen) See anything?  ,3,14
SCULLY: (off screen) Why would he keep them in a secret room?  ,3,14
SCULLY: (off screen) Mulder...  ,3,14
"SCULLY: (off screen) Mulder, what is it?  ",3,14
SCULLY: (off screen) What do you see?  ,3,14
SCULLY: (off screen) Mulder! Can you tell me what's going on in there?  ,3,14
SCULLY: We've turned the studio upside down and there doesn't seem to be any more bodies.  ,3,14
"SCULLY: Five. All of them dismembered, all of them young men whose faces were mutilated. Just like the latest victim here.  ",3,14
SCULLY: What does Patterson have to say?  ,3,14
"SCULLY: Well, I'd have to agree with that theory.  ",3,14
SCULLY: He thinks our finding Mostow's secret gallery isn't going to do him any favors with Patterson.  ,3,14
SCULLY: He requested him?  ,3,14
SCULLY: Mulder's under the impression that Patterson never thought too highly of hm.  ,3,14
SCULLY: Stitches? What happened?  ,3,14
SCULLY: He was going to see what he could find out about these drawings of Mostow's.  ,3,14
"SCULLY: I think the same thing you are, sir. A second killer.  ",3,14
"SCULLY: Mulder? Mulder, its me.  ",3,14
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,3,14
"SCULLY: I was scared, Mulder. I didn't know where you were. I kept trying your cell phone but you didn't answer.  ",3,14
SCULLY: You turned your phone off? Why do you even bother carrying it?  ,3,14
SCULLY: (to EMT) Thanks.  ,3,14
SCULLY: You still haven't told what you were doing in Mostow's studio.  ,3,14
"SCULLY: AT 3:30 in the morning? Mulder, I haven't seen or spoken to you in almost two days. You haven't been returning my calls--  ",3,14
SCULLY: It? What are you talking about?  ,3,14
"SCULLY: Mostow killed those men, Mulder, and out of some sick alliance some other person is continuing where he left off.  ",3,14
"SCULLY: Well, did you actually see it? Mulder, maybe you're seeing what you want to see.  ",3,14
"SCULLY: Listen to yourself, Mulder. Listen to what you're saying. You're starting to sound like...  ",3,14
"SCULLY: Look, when I couldn't reach you, I went to your apartment.  ",3,14
"SCULLY: I saw your new wallpaper. Don't you realize what is happening here, Mulder? He is testing you. He is the reason you were brought on this case in the first place.  ",3,14
SCULLY: He requested your involvement through Skinner's office. I checked the 302 myself.  ,3,14
SCULLY: (tired) Mulder... where are you going?  ,3,14
"SCULLY: Sir, can I have a minute?  ",3,14
SCULLY: In private?  ,3,14
SCULLY: Maybe you can tell me... I'm curious about what you're doing concerning Agent Mulder.  ,3,14
"SCULLY: I think you do, sir. I think you knew exactly how Agent Mulder would respond when you brought him on this case. You did request him, didn't you?  ",3,14
SCULLY: You know I already have.  ,3,14
SCULLY: I just want you to be honest with me about what you're trying to do. Is this some kind of a payback for what happened eight years ago? Because Mulder quit the ISU?  ,3,14
SCULLY: Then why?  ,3,14
SCULLY: And you knew that he could help you solve it.  ,3,14
SCULLY: I'm sorry?  ,3,14
SCULLY: It looks like a partial index.  ,3,14
SCULLY: They're oriented how someone would have gripped the knife.  ,3,14
SCULLY: Your message said that you identified them.  ,3,14
SCULLY: An FBI agent?  ,3,14
SCULLY: These are Mulder's prints?  ,3,14
SCULLY: Are you sure?  ,3,14
SCULLY: Excuse me.  ,3,14
"SCULLY: No, that's okay. You can just throw it on the floor.  ",3,14
"SCULLY: You wanted to see me, sir?  ",3,14
"SCULLY: Yes, sir.  ",3,14
"SCULLY: No, sir.  ",3,14
SCULLY: I'm not altogether certain.  ,3,14
"SCULLY: Yes, sir.  ",3,14
"SCULLY: No, sir.  ",3,14
"SCULLY: I know Agent Mulder is working very hard on this case at your request, sir.  ",3,14
SCULLY: No... sir.  ,3,14
SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder?  ,3,14
SCULLY: Where are you?  ,3,14
SCULLY: Are you with Nemhauser?  ,3,14
"SCULLY: Well, that's who I was calling. He left this number on my answering machine. He said he had to talk to me.  ",3,14
SCULLY: Mulder? Do you know where he is?  ,3,14
"SCULLY: Mulder, that knife that we recovered at the crime scene, I think it's the same one that Mostow used.  ",3,14
SCULLY: Because Mostow's was stolen from evidence.  ,3,14
SCULLY: I was hoping you could tell me. Your prints were all over it.  ,3,14
SCULLY: Why?  ,3,14
"SCULLY: Yeah, but why?  ",3,14
"SCULLY: Okay, Mulder. Listen to me carefully. I want you to stay exactly where you are. I'm going to be there in a few minutes and we're going to work this thing out together. Okay? Mulder?  ",3,14
SCULLY: Mulder! What the hell are you doing?  ,3,14
"SCULLY: First, put the gun down.  ",3,14
SCULLY: Help me understand why you have a gun on Agent Patterson!  ,3,14
SCULLY: Mulder!  ,3,14
"SCULLY: You okay, Mulder?  ",3,14
SCULLY: We should call an ambulance. His pulse is still strong.  ,3,14
SCULLY: And it concerns me?  ,3,15
SCULLY: I see.  ,3,15
"SCULLY: You know, it's strange. Men can blow up buildings, and they can be nowhere near the crime scene but we can piece together the evidence and convict them beyond a doubt. Our labs here can recreate out of the most microscopic detail the motivation and circumstance to almost any murder, right down to a killer's attitude towards his mother and that he was a bed wetter. But in a case of a woman, my sister, who was gunned down in cold blood in a well-lit apartment building by a shooter who left the weapon at the crime scene, we can't even put together enough to keep anybody interested.  ",3,15
"SCULLY: If I may say so sir, it has everything to do with interest. Just not yours, and not mine.  ",3,15
SCULLY: Sorry I'm late.  ,3,15
SCULLY: No. It's nothing. What did you want to talk to me about?  ,3,15
SCULLY: Why is that of interest?  ,3,15
"SCULLY: Longitude uh.. 171 east, latitude 42 north.  ",3,15
SCULLY: Mulder...  ,3,15
SCULLY: So what?  ,3,15
SCULLY: Why don't you just ask them?  ,3,15
SCULLY: From exposure to what?  ,3,15
SCULLY: Could it have anything to do with their resumption in nuclear tests?  ,3,15
"SCULLY: I'm just constantly amazed by you.. you're working down here in the basement, sifting through files and transmissions that any other agent would just throw away in the garbage.  ",3,15
"SCULLY: You're in the basement because they're afraid of you, of your relentlessness and because they know that they could drop you in the middle of the desert, and tell you the truth is out there, and you would ask them for a shovel!  ",3,15
"SCULLY: Well, maybe not a shovel. Maybe a backhoe.  ",3,15
"SCULLY: These symptoms, would you characterize then as acute or somatic? (Dr Seizer is confused) I'm a medical doctor.  ",3,15
SCULLY: What kind of exposure are we talking about here?  ,3,15
SCULLY: That's verging on the levels of victims of Hiroshima suffered.  ,3,15
SCULLY: Did you get the chance to talk to any of them?  ,3,15
SCULLY: Nothing?  ,3,15
"SCULLY: Yeah, thanks. Is this the way you found this room?  ",3,15
"SCULLY: It feels like somebody was looking for something, any idea what?  ",3,15
SCULLY: What for?  ,3,15
SCULLY: It's a North American P-51 Mustang.  ,3,15
SCULLY: It's the shape of the canopy. I used to watch my father and brothers put together World War II model planes as a kid.  ,3,15
SCULLY: No it was just a fighter.  ,3,15
"SCULLY: I don't know, but I might know somebody I can ask.  ",3,15
"SCULLY: Hi, I'm here to see Commander Johansen.  ",3,15
"SCULLY: Special agent Dana Scully, FBI. (she shows her ID)  ",3,15
"SCULLY: No, uh.. he used to be a friend of my father's. I'm out here from Washington and I wanted to surprise him.  ",3,15
"SCULLY: I know my way, thanks.  ",3,15
SCULLY: Commander Johansen?  ,3,15
"SCULLY: I'm Dana Scully, I used to live 3 doors down. My father was Captain William Scully. I went to school with your son..  ",3,15
"SCULLY: Actually sir, I came to see you. I work for the FBI now and there's a question I'm hoping you can answer.  ",3,15
SCULLY: Thank you.  ,3,15
SCULLY: No thank you. I know that you were an officer in the Pacific during World War II. I wanted to ask you about a plane that's been discovered.  ,3,15
"SCULLY: Yes, a P-51 Mustang at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean (Scully looks at her notes..) with the uh..call numbers JTT0 111470.  ",3,15
"SCULLY: There was an illustration on the fuselage with the words ""Drop Dead Red"".  ",3,15
SCULLY: Would the words Zeus Faber mean anything to you?  ,3,15
SCULLY: Well would you know anybody I might be able to talk to? Somebody who might be able to give me that information?  ,3,15
"SCULLY: I wish you could too.  There's a number of French sailors who may die from radiation exposure.  If we knew more about the plane, we might be able to understand why. Anyway.. it was very good to see you again sir.  ",3,15
"SCULLY: I wish I could, he's passed away.  ",3,15
"SCULLY: I have to say this place brings back memories for me. I remember all the kids used to play a game called beckons wanted, right out there. Well.. if you talk to your son, will you tell him I stopped by?  (Johansen nods)  Thank you. (she walks out the house)  ",3,15
SCULLY: Why?  ,3,15
SCULLY: What's this about?  ,3,15
SCULLY: What's going on?  ,3,15
"SCULLY: I'm sorry...there's something else, isn't there?  ",3,15
SCULLY: I don't know if I understand.  ,3,15
SCULLY: You know something about that plane don't you?  ,3,15
"SCULLY: Mulder, it's me, where are you?  ",3,15
"SCULLY: Miramar Airbase. I think I've just found out what those men were exposed to, what the Piper Maru was out there looking for.  ",3,15
"SCULLY: That P-51 Mustang was part of an escort for a B-20 carrying an atomic bomb, just like the one we dropped on Hiroshima. Only this one never reached its target.  ",3,15
"SCULLY: Says one of the men originally sent to find it, on a submarine called the Zeus Faber.  ",3,15
"SCULLY: It all makes sense Mulder, why would they build a nuclear weapon when they can salvage one?  ",3,15
SCULLY: I don't know.  ,3,15
SCULLY: What about you?  ,3,15
SCULLY: Hong Kong?  ,3,15
SCULLY: Radiation killed all those men?  ,3,15
SCULLY: What happened to Sanford and the sick crew men?  ,3,15
SCULLY: Scully.  ,3,15
SCULLY: Yes.  ,3,15
SCULLY: When?  ,3,15
SCULLY: I'm on my way.  ,3,15
"SCULLY: Excuse me, where can I find Walter Skinner? He was brought in with a gunshot wound. (the woman points Scully to a direction)  ",3,16
SCULLY: Agent Fuller. (she walks towards him)  ,3,16
SCULLY: How bad is he?  ,3,16
SCULLY: What happened?  ,3,16
SCULLY: What do we have on the shooter?  ,3,16
SCULLY: Hair and fiber?  ,3,16
SCULLY: This is the assistant director who's been shot. We have to make all resources available.  ,3,16
SCULLY: Excuse me. (she goes to see him)  ,3,16
SCULLY: How is he? (puts her hands on Skinner's)  ,3,16
"SCULLY: He's on steady Demerol, he's in and out. I thought I asked for guards to be posted outside.  ",3,16
SCULLY: This wasn't a random shooting. I want guards posted here and I want them here now!  ,3,16
SCULLY: I've heard the excuses. I don't care if you and agent Caleca have to stand in the hallway yourself. This man has to be protected. Okay? (she walks away)  ,3,16
SCULLY: I got a message you called.  ,3,16
SCULLY: It's on the shooter?  ,3,16
"SCULLY: Which tells us we're looking for a male, probably in his 40s with blood type B positive, but we already know all that from the waitress' description.  ",3,16
SCULLY: We still gotta find the guy before we can get a match.  ,3,16
"SCULLY: This takes too much time. You know what, run them anyway. Can I borrow you this for a little while?  ",3,16
SCULLY: Thanks.  ,3,16
SCULLY: What happened?     (pause)  ,3,16
SCULLY: The State police found you unconscious. You were strapped in the passenger's seat of a rental car that had been driven into a ditch.  ,3,16
"SCULLY: Who's ""we""?  ",3,16
SCULLY: Krycek?  ,3,16
SCULLY: Is that what the men wanted?  ,3,16
"SCULLY: Well it may not be the best time to tell you but, you're not the only one in the hospital. Skinner's been shot.  ",3,16
SCULLY: A bullet perforated his small intestine. The doctor seems to think he'll be fine.  ,3,16
SCULLY: I'm not sure. But I have an idea. (she opens a folder)  ,3,16
"SCULLY: PCR results (Mulder looks at them) this one belongs to the man who shot Skinner. (Mulder puts the 2 sheets together, they match)  ",3,16
"SCULLY: The man who shot Melissa. (Mulder looks again, they match exactly)  ",3,16
"SCULLY: Hi, how are you feeling?  ",3,16
SCULLY: We've determined that the man who shot you was the same man who shot my sister.  ,3,16
"SCULLY: Yes I did, you don't seem surprised.  ",3,16
SCULLY: Do you realize what you're saying sir?  ,3,16
"SCULLY: You're saying, that they closed down my sister's case not because of lack of evidence but because they didn't want us to catch the killer.  ",3,16
SCULLY: The man who shot you.. you said that you've seen him before.  ,3,16
SCULLY: He was working with Krycek?  ,3,16
"SCULLY: Damn it! Krycek, Mulder had him.  ",3,16
SCULLY: I'll be ok (walking out)  ,3,16
SCULLY: It's exactly what they want (leaves)  ,3,16
"SCULLY: (voice over): Addendum to case number 621517, in the absence of any official response my request to have my sister's case reopened, I am now petitioning to devote full Bureau resources to the search for Alex Krycek. Since agent Mulder's release from the hospital, we have had no success locating Krycek or the 2 men he described as his abductors. Personally, I believe Krycek is the key to identify the larger forces behind the crime we are investigating. He alone can name the man who shot my sister, and explain the strange radiation deaths aboard the French salvage vessel.  ",3,16
SCULLY: What's this doing here?  ,3,16
SCULLY: Evidence of what?  ,3,16
SCULLY: What kind of oil?  ,3,16
SCULLY: I don't understand.  ,3,16
SCULLY: I still don't understand how did this get onto the diver and then onto the diver's wife.  ,3,16
SCULLY: So you're saying that this stuff has intelligence.  ,3,16
SCULLY: Waiting to jump into the diver and then into the diver's wife.  ,3,16
SCULLY: Krycek?  ,3,16
SCULLY: Is anybody not looking for Krycek?  ,3,16
SCULLY: Beautiful.  ,3,16
SCULLY: I'll bet.  ,3,16
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,3,16
SCULLY: Does he have an alias?  ,3,16
"SCULLY: Damn it, they think they can just get away with it.  ",3,16
SCULLY: Keep looking for him.  ,3,16
SCULLY: What's it gonna take?  ,3,16
"SCULLY: I've seen stranger things, believe me.  ",3,16
SCULLY: Scully.  ,3,16
SCULLY: They should be why?  ,3,16
SCULLY: I got it covered Mulder.  ,3,16
"SCULLY: Nurse, what happened to the guards who were outside this room?  ",3,16
SCULLY: Where did they go? And what happened to the man who was in this room?  ,3,16
SCULLY: Where is he?  ,3,16
SCULLY: Where did they take him?  ,3,16
SCULLY: Thank you.  ,3,16
"SCULLY (showing her badge): I'm with the FBI, are you transporting a Walter Skinner?  ",3,16
"SCULLY: No everything is fine, I'm just gonna ride with you the rest of the way, ok? (she gets in by the back)  ",3,16
SCULLY: I just wanted to make sure you got where you were going safely.  ,3,16
SCULLY: You just lie still (stands and draws her gun)  ,3,16
SCULLY: Federal agent stop right there! (yelling) Are you Luis Cardinal?! Are you Luis Cardinal?!  ,3,16
SCULLY (still yelling): Are you the man who shot my sister?!  ,3,16
SCULLY: You shot my sister!  ,3,16
SCULLY: Tell me!  ,3,16
SCULLY: Tell me!  ,3,16
SCULLY (shows her badge): FBI.  ,3,16
"SCULLY: Mulder it's me, where are you?  ",3,16
SCULLY: What are you doing?  ,3,16
SCULLY: What are you doing in New York?  ,3,16
"SCULLY: Mulder, your instincts were right about Skinner. We've just arrested a man for what looks like attempted murder.  ",3,16
"SCULLY: It's him Mulder, the man who shot my sister.  ",3,16
"SCULLY: Mulder listen to me, he said he knows where Krycek is. I don't know if this makes any sense to you, he says he's headed towards an abandoned missile site somewhere in North Dakota.  ",3,16
SCULLY: What's in North Dakota?  ,3,16
SCULLY: There must be 200 silos out here. If I'm correct they were all filled with concrete in accord with the disarmament treaty when the base was decommissioned.  ,3,16
SCULLY: My ears are still popping.  ,3,16
SCULLY: Where's the concrete?  ,3,16
"SCULLY: 1 down, 199 silos to go.  ",3,16
SCULLY: We saw bodies in there. (she's taken away) Men with radiation burns!  ,3,16
"SCULLY: I was just thinking about something that a man said to me. That the.. that the dead speak to us from beyond the grave, that that what's conscience is.  ",3,16
"SCULLY: You know I thought... when we found him, this man that killed Melissa, that..that when we brought him to justice, I would feel some kind of closure. But the truth is no court.. no punishment is ever enough.  ",3,16
SCULLY: What are you talking about?  ,3,16
SCULLY: How?  ,3,16
SCULLY: And what about Krycek?  ,3,16
SCULLY: You think they got to him too.  ,3,16
"SCULLY: I think the dead are speaking to us Mulder, demanding justice. Maybe that man was right. Maybe we bury the dead alive.  ",3,16
SCULLY: He wanted to turn himself in?  ,3,17
SCULLY: So you think he was just a crank?  ,3,17
SCULLY: What connection did this dead deputy have with him?  ,3,17
SCULLY: Then why did he free him?  ,3,17
SCULLY: Willed him? How?  ,3,17
"SCULLY: Still, what does it mean?  ",3,17
"SCULLY: I'm sorry, I couldn't help noticing.  ",3,17
"SCULLY: Mulder, I'm still not sure what we're looking for.  ",3,17
"SCULLY: Yes, but advertise for what? I mean, how... how did this ""Pusher"" convince an otherwise honest deputy sheriff to free him? I mean, I'm sure you have a theory.  ",3,17
SCULLY: Inducing someone to buy hair color is a little different than inducing them to drive in front of a speeding truck.  ,3,17
"SCULLY: Well, even if he could push his will, why would he, he cause an accident when he himself was in the car?  ",3,17
SCULLY: Ohio State University?  ,3,17
SCULLY: The time span of the murders.  ,3,17
SCULLY: I say we run down those telephone numbers.  ,3,17
SCULLY: Sorry.  ,3,17
"SCULLY: No luck, I take it?  ",3,17
SCULLY: Okay on the trace.  ,3,17
SCULLY: Okay.  ,3,17
SCULLY: Phone book.  ,3,17
SCULLY: Hang on a second.  ,3,17
"SCULLY: Yeah, it's me again. We want the last number dialed out from this location. Just ring it on through. Okay.  ",3,17
SCULLY: So he's a killer and a golfer.  ,3,17
SCULLY: Mulder.  ,3,17
SCULLY: I dug up a few more things on our Robert Patrick Modell.  ,3,17
SCULLY: Which branch of service?  ,3,17
SCULLY: Did you know that he applied to the F.B.I.?  ,3,17
SCULLY: Yeah.  ,3,17
"SCULLY: The screener caught him in a dozen self-aggrandizing lies... saying that he was a master of martial arts, that he had been trained by gurkhas in Nepal and ninjas in Japan.  ",3,17
"SCULLY: Are we talking kung-fu movies, Mulder?  ",3,17
"SCULLY: Even if Modell could, he didn't need to. We barely had a case against him.  ",3,17
"SCULLY: Please explain to me the scientific nature of the ""whammy.""  ",3,17
"SCULLY: Mulder, Modell's last known employment was as a convenience store clerk. He has never been trained by ninjas. He has never even been out of the U.S. He is just a little man who wishes that he were someone big... and, and, we're feeding that wish. That, that failed psyche screening... if, if Modell could actually control people's minds, right now, he'd be an F.B.I. agent, right? He'd be a Green Beret, uh, a Navy Seal.  ",3,17
"SCULLY: What do you need me to say, Mulder, that I believe that Modell is guilty of murder? I do. I'm just looking for an explanation a little more mundane than ""the whammy.""  ",3,17
"SCULLY: Holly, can you tell us anything more that might help us understand why you attacked Assistant Director Skinner?  ",3,17
SCULLY: Modell?  ,3,17
"SCULLY: I have to agree with Agent Mulder, sir. I can't even begin to explain how, but I think that Modell is responsible for your injuries?  ",3,17
SCULLY: Now he knows where you live.  ,3,17
SCULLY: Lights coming on!  ,3,17
SCULLY: Svengali.  ,3,17
SCULLY: And nearby buildings too. We know that Modell likes to watch from a distance.  ,3,17
"SCULLY: Is there anything else you can tell me? Yeah, yeah. When does it date to? Right.  ",3,17
SCULLY: It's to relieve Modell's seizures. He has temporal-lobe epilepsy. I just talked to his doctor's office. They wouldn't give me much over the phone... just that that prescription dates back to April 1994.  ,3,17
"SCULLY: Uh, head injury, neurological disease, a brain tumor or a lesion...  ",3,17
"SCULLY: Mulder, those reports are completely unsubstantiated.  ",3,17
SCULLY: Brought on by the brain tumor?  ,3,17
"SCULLY: Mulder, more to the point, if Modell did have a brain tumor, the effects on his health would be more debilitating. It's, it's likely that he simply wouldn't be well enough to play these cat-and-mouse games with us.  ",3,17
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,3,17
SCULLY: And he wants to go out in a blaze of glory.  ,3,17
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,3,17
SCULLY: No pulse. Get an ambulance.  ,3,17
SCULLY: Fairfax Mercy Pharmacy...  ,3,17
"SCULLY: Right, thank you.  ",3,17
SCULLY: The outpatient office says Modell is scheduled for a two-thirty M.R.I. That's right now.  ,3,17
SCULLY: Why?  ,3,17
SCULLY: You.  ,3,17
SCULLY: Take it.  ,3,17
"SCULLY: I'm with you, Mulder.  ",3,17
SCULLY: Mulder.  ,3,17
SCULLY: We're losing you!  ,3,17
"SCULLY: Mulder, what happened?  ",3,17
"SCULLY: Mulder, wait, wait. Get close to the computer monitor.  ",3,17
"SCULLY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, right there.  ",3,17
"SCULLY: You were right, Mulder.  ",3,17
"SCULLY: Mulder, just get out of there.  ",3,17
SCULLY: Just wait for a signal from me.  ,3,17
SCULLY: Mulder.  ,3,17
SCULLY: We've got a dozen law enforcement officers outside in the hall... another thirty in the parking lot.  ,3,17
"SCULLY: So whatever you've got planned, it's not going to work out the way you it want to.  ",3,17
"SCULLY: Wait. Mulder, look... there's pure oxygen in this room.  ",3,17
"SCULLY: Mulder, no.  ",3,17
"SCULLY: Mulder, listen to me. Give me the gun. We can stop this thing right now. You and I can walk outside of this room...  ",3,17
"SCULLY: Mulder, fight him. You can fight this.  ",3,17
"SCULLY: There's no telling how long he'll hang on, but he'll never regain consciousness.  ",3,17
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,3,17
SCULLY: Why?  ,3,17
SCULLY: I say we don't let him take up another minute of our time.  ,3,17
SCULLY: How did you learn about what happened here last night?  ,3,18
"SCULLY: According to the police, you felt this murder may have been an act of political terrorism.  ",3,18
"SCULLY: Is that the survey and excavation of the uh  (reads) ""highland burial grounds of the Secona Indians?"" (he seems surprised, doesnt answer) This is from a letter that was sent to the State Department on behalf of the Secona demanding the return of a certain artifact.  ",3,18
SCULLY: Rescued?  ,3,18
"SCULLY: As I understand it, Roosevelt disappeared under circumstances not dissimilar to the ones here.  ",3,18
SCULLY: But thats not what you believe.  ,3,18
SCULLY: Have there ever been any death threats?  ,3,18
SCULLY: Did you know Craig Horning?  ,3,18
SCULLY: Did he have any warning that this could happen?  ,3,18
SCULLY: Are you aware that a letter of protest was sent to the State Department concerning this urn?  ,3,18
SCULLY: This one was written by a man named Alonzo Bilac.  ,3,18
SCULLY: Is he still with the project?  ,3,18
SCULLY: Why is that?  ,3,18
SCULLY: Dr. Bilac?  ,3,18
SCULLY: (showing badge) Were with the FBI. Were investigating the disappearance of an associate of yours --- Craig Horning.  ,3,18
SCULLY: May we ask you some questions?  ,3,18
"SCULLY: Dr. Bilac, you were part of the expedition that brought back the Amaru urn.  ",3,18
SCULLY: Mona Wustner.  ,3,18
SCULLY: But you were Dr. Roosevelt's liaison in Ecuador. At what point did you part company with him on the taking of artifacts?  ,3,18
SCULLY: Did you express that to him?  ,3,18
SCULLY: Were you speaking for yourself or for the Indians?  ,3,18
"SCULLY: Well, apparently, theyve learned something from you too.  ",3,18
SCULLY: Dr. Lewton believes that the protest over the Amaru urn has something to do with Craig Horning's disappearance.  ,3,18
SCULLY: What do you think happened to him?  ,3,18
"SCULLY: Let me ask you, Dr. Bilac. How far would you go to defend the rights of the Seconas? Farther than writing a letter to the state department?  ",3,18
SCULLY: Can you account for your whereabouts last night?  ,3,18
SCULLY: You mean the kind who would kill for their cause?  ,3,18
SCULLY: No. I think he's *the* suspect.  ,3,18
"SCULLY: Based on the arrogance of his politics, on his rift with Dr. Lewton, on his sympathies towards the Indians. And the lack of any other suspect.  ",3,18
SCULLY: Maybe because he was up late murdering Craig Horning.  ,3,18
SCULLY: Craig Horning's blood. What do you think he did with him?  ,3,18
SCULLY: You think Bilac's innocent? That the victim wasn't even murdered at all? That he was devoured by a mythological jaguar spirit?  ,3,18
SCULLY: Label that.  ,3,18
SCULLY: (as if the answer is obvious) Partial rat body part.  ,3,18
SCULLY: Excuse me Can I have a word with you? You were working here last night when Dr. Lewton was killed.  ,3,18
SCULLY: Did you notice anything out of the ordinary? Was he behaving strange or did he seem nervous about anything?  ,3,18
SCULLY: Did he say anything to you about Dr. Bilac?  ,3,18
SCULLY: Do you have any idea when the two of them last spoke to each other?  ,3,18
SCULLY: (giving up) I'm going to give you my card. Call me if anything comes to mind.  ,3,18
SCULLY: Mulder  ,3,18
SCULLY: No. They've been over the entire museum grounds. Have you found anything at all out here?  ,3,18
"SCULLY: Well, they determined that the hood release had been pulled. They found a small flashlight near the car. Looks to me like he was checking the engine when attacked.  ",3,18
"SCULLY: I dont think so, Mulder.  ",3,18
SCULLY: We found evidence of at least two mutilated rat bodies down in the engine compartment.  ,3,18
"SCULLY: Apparently, the museum has always had a rat problem. They must have crawled into the engine to keep warm.  ",3,18
"SCULLY: You know, Mulder, there's hardly a thing about these deaths that adds up.  ",3,18
SCULLY: Somewhere between 9:30 and midnight when the guard discovered the blood.  ,3,18
SCULLY: Whats the connection?  ,3,18
SCULLY: I think Mona Wustner might know something.  ,3,18
"SCULLY: Well, she seemed to get nervous when I asked her about Bilac. Maybe shes trying to protect him.  ",3,18
"SCULLY: I dont think so, Mulder.  ",3,18
"SCULLY: Well, it's human. Small intestine. There's about four feet of jejunum and another foot of ileum.  ",3,18
"SCULLY: Yeah, by what he had for lunch. Corn chowder. It looks like he'd been snacking on sunflower seeds all afternoon.  ",3,18
SCULLY: What I can't determine how the body was eviscerated. There are no knife marks on the epithelium. I imagine they could have been torn or pulled from the body cavity.  ,3,18
"SCULLY: But I can't determine that, either, because there was considerable postmortem predation.  ",3,18
"SCULLY: Well, by the size of the bite marks, a small animal, most probably a rat.  ",3,18
SCULLY: Yep.  ,3,18
"SCULLY: (on phone) Scully? . Slow down, Mona.  ",3,18
"SCULLY: (on phone) What happened, Mona?  ",3,18
"SCULLY: (on phone, voice) Where is he now?  ",3,18
"SCULLY: (on phone) I want you to stay exactly where you are. Im going to send Agent Mulder over to get you, right away, okay? Hes on his way.  ",3,18
SCULLY: Dr. Bilac?  ,3,18
"SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, its me. Did you find Mona?  ",3,18
"SCULLY: (on phone) No. Hes not here either. But I found his journals. ""I've seen the Amaru coming out of the jungle with the eyes of a scorpion, the claws of a jaguar. She leaps down from the trees. She tears at my flesh, then holds my head in her hands, and eats out my eyes.""  ",3,18
SCULLY: (on phone) These are all recent.  ,3,18
SCULLY: (on phone) Why?  ,3,18
"SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, I think Bilacs been tripping. I found something strange in a ceremonial bowl and - and from his writings it says that its .. its a hallucinogen called ""Yaje."" ""The Vine of the Soul.""  ",3,18
SCULLY: (on phone) I think he's been praying to the Amaru through some kind of a ceremony.  ,3,18
"SCULLY: (on phone) It looks like he's invoking the curse, Mulder.  ",3,18
SCULLY: (on phone) Did you find Mona?  ,3,18
SCULLY: Where is she?  ,3,18
SCULLY: You told Agent Mulder that she was dead. You must know where she is.  ,3,18
SCULLY: Then why do you have blood on your clothes?  ,3,18
SCULLY: She said she was scared. She said that you became violent.  ,3,18
"SCULLY: Maybe you were too high to know the difference. There is no curse, is there, Dr. Bilac? You are the curse.  ",3,18
"SCULLY: Im going to ask you one more time, Dr, Bilac, where is Monas body?  ",3,18
"SCULLY: (to OFFICER and GUARD at door) That man stays in that room until there's a full search of the museum, okay?  ",3,18
SCULLY: I just assumed that one of the toilets had overflowed.  ,3,18
SCULLY: There's only one way to find out.  ,3,18
SCULLY: How did they get in there.  ,3,18
SCULLY: Mona Wustner?  ,3,18
SCULLY: What did you find?  ,3,18
SCULLY: Warfarin?  ,3,18
SCULLY: The dog ate a cat.  ,3,18
SCULLY: The cat ate a rat.  ,3,18
SCULLY: Yeah.  ,3,18
SCULLY: Significant of what?  ,3,18
"SCULLY: Its an old building, Mulder. They have a rat problem. A lot of old buildings have rats.  ",3,18
SCULLY: Yaje.  ,3,18
"SCULLY: So, what are we talking here, Mulder, a possessed rat? The return of Ben?  ",3,18
SCULLY: From something that sent them diving into the toilet.  ,3,18
"SCULLY: Have *you* been drinking Yaje, Mulder?  ",3,18
SCULLY: What? Hows that possible?  ,3,18
SCULLY: Did you step away from this door at any time?  ,3,18
SCULLY: And no one entered this room?  ,3,18
SCULLY: Are there any other doors or windows in this room?  ,3,18
SCULLY: You didnt hear anything?  ,3,18
SCULLY: I want you to search the entire building beginning with every room on this floor.  ,3,18
SCULLY: Where does it lead to?  ,3,18
SCULLY: You think Bilac crawled down there?  ,3,18
SCULLY: (looking at blueprints) The system looks like it branches off into three directions. There must be miles of tunneling down there.  ,3,18
SCULLY: And one way out.  ,3,18
"SCULLY: (looking at blueprints) To the left, it looks like.  ",3,18
SCULLY: We should be directly under the museum here.  ,3,18
SCULLY: (in another tunnel) What is it?  ,3,18
"SCULLY: Oh, my God. Its Dr. Lewton. It looks like his eyes were eaten right out of his sockets.  ",3,18
SCULLY: What is it?  ,3,18
SCULLY: You think that cat killed those people?  ,3,18
"SCULLY: No, Mulder, this way. Theres a room here with a vent. Up there.  ",3,18
SCULLY: Its Bilac.  ,3,18
SCULLY: Yeah.  ,3,18
"SCULLY: Well, the search team's on their way back up. They've recovered all the bodies including Mona's and Bilac's.  ",3,18
"SCULLY: Animal control is still looking. So far, they haven't found any sign of them.  ",3,18
"SCULLY: No ones denying that, Mulder, its just that there are miles of tunnels down there. And theyre saying its gonna take weeks to search them all.  ",3,18
SCULLY: What are you talking about?  ,3,18
SCULLY: What for?  ,3,18
SCULLY: The curse?  ,3,18
SCULLY: Are they going to send back the bones?  ,3,18
"SCULLY: What a way to go. Have you seen this MO before, Detective? Men cremated alive?  ",3,19
SCULLY: His name was Johnny Lo. He moved here about six months ago from Canton. Still in the INS application process. He was a dishwasher in Chinatown.  ,3,19
SCULLY: (short laugh at MULDERs joke) I think it's pretty clear this is some kind of a horrific cult or gang retribution killing.  ,3,19
SCULLY: I dont know.  ,3,19
SCULLY: So now were chasing ghosts?  ,3,19
SCULLY: So you're saying that the ancestral spirits pushed Johnny Lo into the oven and turned on the gas?  ,3,19
SCULLY: (touching it) It's still tacky.  ,3,19
SCULLY: Someone's been here. This place has been cleaned out. Look at this.  ,3,19
SCULLY: Maybe it's this new carpet.  ,3,19
SCULLY: What slumlord would spring for a new carpet in a dump like this?  ,3,19
SCULLY: What's this?  ,3,19
SCULLY: And what about this?  ,3,19
SCULLY: I couldn't tell you what any one of these things are.  ,3,19
SCULLY: Does she remember Johnny Lo or remember selling it to him?  ,3,19
SCULLY: What was that about?  ,3,19
"SCULLY: What about you, detective? Do you believe in Yu Lan Hui?  ",3,19
SCULLY: What were they doing here?  ,3,19
SCULLY: I still don't understand what anybody would want with an empty grave.  ,3,19
SCULLY: A lot. And I haven't even finished my preliminary visual exam. (pulls plastic off the scarred body) Look at this. This guy's like a jigsaw puzzle. These are all surgical incisions and judging by the color of the scars Id say they were all made within the last year.  ,3,19
"SCULLY: If you ask me, nothing.  ",3,19
"SCULLY: Do you know how much the human body is worth, Mulder?  ",3,19
SCULLY: (putting on latex gloves) It's worth a fortune.  ,3,19
"SCULLY: A kidney, a portion of the liver, a cornea bone marrow... A person can lose these things and live to cash his social security checks.  ",3,19
"SCULLY: No, but if Im right this is one man who left his heart in San Francisco.  ",3,19
"SCULLY: I only saw one body, but the only thing that wasn't burned to a delicate crisp on Johnny Lo was his glass eye.  ",3,19
"SCULLY: Oh, God.  ",3,19
SCULLY: Maybe you can tell us. It was found in the body cavity of the man who was dumped in the grave.  ,3,19
SCULLY: You said the frog was a symbol of luck and prosperity. Unless this is somebodys sick joke Id say it must have another meaning.  ,3,19
SCULLY: Maybe you can tell me this: have you heard any word on the street about the black market selling of body parts?  ,3,19
"SCULLY: This man with the frog in his chest was missing a cornea and a kidney. They were taken prior to the time of death before the final removal of his heart. (MULDER watches CHAO intently) And I found what is known as ""sterile ice"" on the skin in and around the incision on his chest. It is a substance that is used to preserve human organs for transplant.  ",3,19
SCULLY: Either you resent us being here or you feel some kind of protectiveness towards the Chinese community.  ,3,19
"SCULLY: Mr. Hsin, can I ask what happened to your eye?  ",3,19
"SCULLY: Mr. Hsin, you laid a carpet in an apartment that was occupied by a man named Johnny Lo.  ",3,19
SCULLY: We contacted the man that you work for. He said it must have been a job you took on the side. He has no record of a work order.  ,3,19
SCULLY: His name was Johnny Lo. He's dead now-- murdered-- and we think that the carpet was laid in an attempt to cover up evidence. Now your employer says .  ,3,19
SCULLY: Do you remember who called you about the job?  ,3,19
SCULLY: Whats up?  ,3,19
SCULLY: That this guy didnt have an accident at work.  ,3,19
SCULLY: I say we monitor Hsins every movements.  ,3,19
SCULLY: Look like you just saw a ghost.  ,3,19
"SCULLY: He hasnt left his apartment, has he?  ",3,19
"SCULLY: (putting on seatbelt) Well, you can use the one down at St. Francis Hospital.  ",3,19
SCULLY: Detective Chao was attacked in his town house tonight. I just talked to Lieutenant Neary. He says hes cut up pretty bad.  ,3,19
"SCULLY: I dont know, but I think we should go check it out.  ",3,19
SCULLY: How is he?  ,3,19
SCULLY: Why would he just take off?  ,3,19
SCULLY: You want to see what his injuries were?  ,3,19
SCULLY: His blood type?  ,3,19
SCULLY: You think Chaos involved?  ,3,19
"SCULLY: (checking her notes) Uh, O-negative.  ",3,19
SCULLY: That the blood that we found on the carpet padding in the victim's apartment was Detective Chaos.  ,3,19
SCULLY: Mr. Hsin.  ,3,19
SCULLY: We're looking for Mr. Hsin. Is he home?  ,3,19
SCULLY: Are you his daughter?  ,3,19
SCULLY: May we talk to you?  ,3,19
"SCULLY: You're sick, aren't you?  ",3,19
SCULLY: But that's a treatable form of cancer.  ,3,19
SCULLY: (looking up from some papers she has been looking through) This is a human leukocyte work-up. Was your father rejected as a bone marrow donor?  ,3,19
"SCULLY: This is from the Organ Procurement Organization. Its dated only a month ago. Your father had an HLA but he also had his kidneys measured, his liver.  ",3,19
SCULLY: Thanks. We need some information and we need it as soon as possible.  ,3,19
SCULLY: You had a man come in here named Shuyang Hsin. He had an HLA work up and .  ,3,19
SCULLY: Yeah. Thats where the doctors phone is registered.  ,3,19
SCULLY: Or sterile ice.  ,3,19
SCULLY: What is that?  ,3,19
SCULLY: Hes still alive.  ,3,19
"SCULLY: No ghosts called to those men. You did, by preying on their hopelessness and their desperation.  ",3,19
SCULLY: You cheated them out of life by promising them prosperity when the only possible reward was death.  ,3,19
SCULLY: I understand this. You are going to prison for a very long time.  ,3,19
SCULLY: What about his daughter?  ,3,19
SCULLY: That's great.  ,3,19
SCULLY: What's wrong?  ,3,19
SCULLY: And?  ,3,19
SCULLY: What about Chao? His testimony would be enough.  ,3,19
"SCULLY: Well, I'd never actually much considered it myself before I started this job.  ",3,20
"SCULLY: Yes, and I feel that I must apologize for his refusal to speak with you, Mister Chung, but, uh, I must admit, I probably wouldn't have myself if I wasn't such an admirer of your work.  ",3,20
"SCULLY: ""The Lonely Buddha"" is one of my favorite novels.  ",3,20
SCULLY: What made you decide to write a book about an alien abduction if you're not that interested in the subject yourself?  ,3,20
SCULLY: Well... just as long as you're attempting to record the truth.  ,3,20
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,3,20
SCULLY: So you're here to get my version of the truth?  ,3,20
"SCULLY: Well... not right away, of course. Um... not enough time had elapsed for it to be considered a missing person's case before the girl was found the following morning.  ",3,20
"SCULLY: She was suffering from what my partner calls ""missing time."" She recalled nothing of the previous night, nor how she had arrived at her present whereabouts. Her body exhibited signs of physical abuse, and all of her clothes were on backwards or inside-out.  ",3,20
"SCULLY: Actually, I prefer neither, but my partner uses ""abductee.""  ",3,20
"SCULLY: Well, regardless, the girl was considered neither at the time. She appeared more to be the victim of date rape than anything else.  ",3,20
"SCULLY: The father informed the police, who apprehended the boy back at his own home.  ",3,20
SCULLY: And he stuck to his story... until we got there.  ,3,20
"SCULLY: That should have ended our investigation, but Mulder brought the girl in for questioning.  ",3,20
"SCULLY: So, my partner became convinced that she was suffering from what he calls ""post-abduction syndrome.""  ",3,20
"SCULLY: Well, I think that stress of any kind can cause all of those physical ailments. In any case, Mulder convinced the girl and her parents to let her be hypnotized.  ",3,20
"SCULLY: I know that it has its therapeutic value, but it has never been proven to enhance memory. In fact, it actually worsens it since, since, since people in that state or prone to confabulation.  ",3,20
SCULLY: One of the greatest thrillers ever written.  ,3,20
SCULLY: Hmm.  ,3,20
SCULLY: No one still knows.  ,3,20
"SCULLY: That's my problem with it, Mulder. It's all a little too typical. Abduction lore has become so prevalent in our society that you can ask someone to imagine what it would be like to be abducted and they'd concoct an identical scenario.  ",3,20
"SCULLY: Well, of course, he didn't actually say ""bleeped."" He said...  ",3,20
SCULLY: Harold... did you and Chrissy engage in consensual sexual intercourse that night?  ,3,20
"SCULLY: So we know that it wasn't an alien who probed her. Mulder, you've got two kids having sex before they're mature enough to know how to handle it.  ",3,20
"SCULLY: It's a lot more plausible than an alien abduction, especially in light of their contradictory stories.  ",3,20
SCULLY: Why did you wait till now to tell us this information? Two kids' lives may be affected by it.  ,3,20
SCULLY: At which point?  ,3,20
"SCULLY: Unfortunately, I'm not sure that modern reconstruction of ancient fairy tales lends any more credence to Roky's testimony.  ",3,20
"SCULLY: In short, Roky showed signs of being what is known as a fantasy-prone personality.  ",3,20
SCULLY: How did you get a copy?  ,3,20
SCULLY: It definitely was peculiar.  ,3,20
"SCULLY: Wh, wh, well, Mulder's had his share of peculiar notions. He's not inclined to dismiss anything outright.  ",3,20
SCULLY: Who are you calling?  ,3,20
SCULLY: Re-hypnotized? What for?  ,3,20
"SCULLY: So the girl was put under again to see if she could confirm any of the boy's story. And as I suspected she might under such conditions, she did.  ",3,20
"SCULLY: Mulder, I think you and the hypnotherapist were leading her and I think there was more confabulation in the second version than in the first.  ",3,20
SCULLY: Wrap it up.  ,3,20
"SCULLY: You never saw this. This didn't happen. You tell anyone, you're a dead man.  ",3,20
"SCULLY: That's ridiculous! I'm... and besides, we allowed him to view the autopsy.  ",3,20
SCULLY: This is so embarrassing.  ,3,20
SCULLY: But see? Whoever got ahold of this footage edited it in such a way as to delete all the significant findings.  ,3,20
"SCULLY: No, but I found our alien's I.D. You were right, Mulder. Air Force Major Robert Vallee.  ",3,20
"SCULLY: Well, the major is dead. His body is being detained for further investigation.  ",3,20
SCULLY: I don't see why no...  ,3,20
SCULLY: So what else is new?  ,3,20
SCULLY: The wound is situated to the left of the midline abdomen. The edges of the tissue appear...  ,3,20
"SCULLY: After not recovering the tape, Mulder was heading back to the motel and that's when his account of things gets a little... odd.  ",3,20
"SCULLY: Well, not after what happened when Mulder left the diner and got back to the motel.  ",3,20
"SCULLY: Mulder, these gentlemen have something very important to tell you.  ",3,20
SCULLY: Mulder didn't say that it was Alex Trebek. It was just someone that looked incredibly like him.  ,3,20
"SCULLY: Well, not exactly, I'm... I don't have any recollection of this. I... was surprised to wake up the next morning with Mulder asleep in my room.  ",3,20
SCULLY: Scully. We'll be right there.  ,3,20
SCULLY: I know it probably doesn't have the sense of closure that you want... but it has more than some of our other cases.  ,3,20
"SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, it's me. I just got your message. You said Skinner called in a homicide?  ",3,21
SCULLY: I don't understand.  ,3,21
"SCULLY: Most of it. Mulder, I'm on my way.  ",3,21
"SCULLY: (to recorder) The conspicuous absence of any contusions or lacerations would strongly suggest that the victim's injuries were sustained without a struggle. From my observations, I would have to concur with the county coroner's report that her murder was most probably a sudden and violent act (Mulder enters) in a vulnerable moment. Beyond this, I found nothing in my post-mortem examination to recommend further investigation.  ",3,21
"SCULLY: Her spinal cord was crushed, Mulder. The cervical vertebrae was fractured in what appears to be manual trauma.  ",3,21
"SCULLY: So far. They found no semen samples. There was some irritation, probably an allergic reaction to latex.  ",3,21
SCULLY: Have they learned anything more?  ,3,21
SCULLY: Have you talked to anybody she worked with?  ,3,21
SCULLY: An indiscretion?  ,3,21
SCULLY: What kind of work?  ,3,21
SCULLY: Give me five minutes here.  ,3,21
SCULLY: (To recorder) Addendum: observed what appears to be a residual phosphorescence around the victim's mouth and nose. Note to have this analyzed.  ,3,21
SCULLY: Business must be booming.  ,3,21
"SCULLY: We'd like to ask you some questions about an employee of yours - Carina Sayles. She does work for you, doesn't she?  ",3,21
"SCULLY: Well, you can start by telling us if she was working last night, and if she was, who paid for her company.  ",3,21
SCULLY: I also doubt that they'd want to get entangled in a homicide investigation.  ,3,21
SCULLY: It just doesn't seem like him.  ,3,21
"SCULLY: Well, I think the lack of discretion is the least of his sins.  ",3,21
"SCULLY: No, but that doesn't mean that we can discount the evidence.  ",3,21
"SCULLY: Look, Mulder, I feel the same way about Skinner as you do, but we were just shown a dated record with Skinner's credit card number on it.  ",3,21
"SCULLY: Skinner was in bed with a prostitute at the time of her death, and he's offered us no explanation or alibi. (they get into the car) Truth is, we don't know very much about him. We don't know what he does off duty, who he really is.  ",3,21
SCULLY: Even if it means proving his guilt?  ,3,21
SCULLY: Who was that?  ,3,21
"SCULLY: Why won't you tell us what happened last night, sir?  ",3,21
SCULLY: Do you know him?  ,3,21
"SCULLY: We were just a little caught off guard. Neither of us even knew that he was married. I mean, he never told us.  ",3,21
SCULLY: Has he always been such a private person?  ,3,21
SCULLY: Including you?  ,3,21
SCULLY: Is that why you were separated?  ,3,21
SCULLY: Excuse me.  ,3,21
"SCULLY: Sorry. Mulder, we've gotta go. (to Sharon) You have our numbers if you need to reach us.  ",3,21
SCULLY: What's going on here?  ,3,21
SCULLY: That's right.  ,3,21
SCULLY: Available for what?  ,3,21
SCULLY: He's doing everything he shouldn't be doing.  ,3,21
"SCULLY: He's behaving like a guilty man, Mulder.  ",3,21
"SCULLY: It's his irrational behavior that concerns me. It speaks to a state of mind. If, if a, if an otherwise stable man is compelled to go out and hire a prostitute, what else is he capable of?  ",3,21
"SCULLY: I *am*, Mulder, believe me. (puts her hand to her chest) I'm not trying to convince myself.  ",3,21
"SCULLY: Well, maybe he doesn't remember.  ",3,21
SCULLY: Not necessarily.  ,3,21
"SCULLY: This man is running away from a train. He sees it coming straight at him. He hears its whistle. Several times a month, he ran away from that train. Until one night, he broke his wife's arm when he threw her to the floor.  ",3,21
"SCULLY: No, night terrors and sleep walking occur doing slow-wave non-dream sleep. The clinical term for this is REM sleep behavior disorder. Although rare, dozens of cases of sleep-related violence have been attributed to it.  ",3,21
"SCULLY: This video tape came from the Bethesda Sleep Disorder Center, where Skinner has been receiving treatment for the past three months.  ",3,21
"SCULLY: The same disorder, different dreams. (hands him a file) According to Skinner's psychiatrist, he's been experiencing a recurring dream in which he's confronted by an old woman. She speaks to him but he doesn't understand the words. Sometimes, she, she straddles his chest, suffocating him.  ",3,21
"SCULLY: Defending himself against this imaginary old woman. A lot of these patients have no recollection of their nocturnal activities, which might explain Skinner's amnesia.  ",3,21
SCULLY: It isn't?  ,3,21
SCULLY: Visits them for sex?  ,3,21
SCULLY: (pointing to the glow) What's that?  ,3,21
"SCULLY: I feel kinda strange saying this, but I found something during my post-mortem exam that I think you should see.  ",3,21
"SCULLY: It's a circular patch around the victim's mouth and nose, approximately 11 centimeters in diameter. It retained light energy. It glowed in the dark.  ",3,21
"SCULLY: I know what I saw, Mulder. It was here.  ",3,21
SCULLY: No. It was definitely visible to the naked eye.  ,3,21
SCULLY: Yeah. I sent on over to Chem-Tox.  ,3,21
"SCULLY: Well, my first hunch was that it was some kind of a fungal growth, but the only substance that they detected was amylase, which is found in saliva. So I had them send a sample to the elemental analysis unit. The results should be back. (to phone) Yes, this is Agent Dana Scully. I'm calling to find out the lab results on a tissue sample that I sent in earlier this morning. Thank you. (hangs up)  ",3,21
SCULLY: That there was no analyzable substance in the sample container.  ,3,21
"SCULLY: Mulder, I'm afraid this isn't exactly something that I'd make up.  ",3,21
SCULLY: That he did it?  ,3,21
SCULLY: Number 5.  ,3,21
"SCULLY: According to Woltos' report, the hood was still warm when they got to Skinner's apartment, even with the rain. Look at the left front panel. The matched the paint in the dent to Sharon Skinner's car.  ",3,21
SCULLY: The only prints they found on the steering wheel were Skinner's.  ,3,21
SCULLY: Sure. Why?  ,3,21
"SCULLY: I don't know what you're expecting to find, Mulder, but uh, Skinner's hearing is in half an hour.  ",3,21
SCULLY: What are you doing?  ,3,21
"SCULLY: Yes, sir.  ",3,21
"SCULLY: No, sir. None of the physical evidence we recovered directly connects the assistant director to her death.  ",3,21
SCULLY: I took a sample of an extraneous substance that turned out to be unidentifiable.  ,3,21
SCULLY: A naturally occurring enzyme around her mouth and nose.  ,3,21
SCULLY: No.  ,3,21
"SCULLY: Sir, I feel reluctant to say or to speak for Agent Mulder.  ",3,21
SCULLY: Agent Mulder had a theory that the substance could have come from a visitation.  ,3,21
"SCULLY: No. I'm sorry, I don't.  ",3,21
SCULLY: Whatever extreme cases I have encountered I have always viewed through the lens of science. I believe that is why I was assigned to the X-Files and to Agent Mulder.  ,3,21
"SCULLY: Excuse me, sir, I don't understand the question.  ",3,21
"SCULLY: No, sir. Not at all.  ",3,21
SCULLY: I believe the Assistant Director has protected us out of a respect for the work.  ,3,21
SCULLY: No. That is not true.  ,3,21
"SCULLY: Sir, if I may ...  ",3,21
SCULLY: I'm not finished.  ,3,21
SCULLY: (to phone) Mulder?  ,3,21
SCULLY: You missed it. Not that anything you said would have made a difference.  ,3,21
SCULLY: Out of a job.  ,3,21
SCULLY: He would have had a better chance against a firing squad.  ,3,21
SCULLY: How'd you know?  ,3,21
SCULLY: But why?  ,3,21
SCULLY: What am I looking at?  ,3,21
SCULLY: I don't understand. Why would they orchestrate such an elaborate scheme just to set him up? Why not just kill him?  ,3,21
SCULLY: Who is this guy?  ,3,21
SCULLY: So how are we supposed to find him?  ,3,21
SCULLY: So he must have hired the prostitute.  ,3,21
"SCULLY: Mulder, look.  ",3,21
"SCULLY: Judy, we need you to identify somebody.  ",3,21
SCULLY: And Lorraine. He's cleaning house.  ,3,21
"SCULLY: Agent Mulder's right. I'll stay with you if you want, until we take him into custody.  ",3,21
SCULLY: (to phone) Did you get him?  ,3,21
SCULLY: He should have been here fifteen minutes ago.  ,3,21
SCULLY: (to Judy) Nothing.  ,3,21
SCULLY: (to Mulder on the phone) Maybe it's the rain.  ,3,21
"SCULLY: Mulder, hang on a second. (calls into next room) Judy?  ",3,21
"SCULLY: Mulder, get up here right now.  ",3,21
SCULLY: Judy?  ,3,21
SCULLY: I'm sorry. I called but you didn't answer.  ,3,21
SCULLY: What's the matter?  ,3,21
SCULLY: Uhhh ...  ,3,21
SCULLY: Mmm-hmmm ...  ,3,21
SCULLY: Sir?  ,3,21
"SCULLY: This is our report. You'll see, though, that several questions remain unanswered.  ",3,21
"SCULLY: We ran his face and fingerprints through every available database. There's still no matches. And we're doing a dental record search, but that'll probably be a dead end, too. And regarding the other man ... the telephone number that we had for him has been disconnected, and there's no record of an account.  ",3,21
SCULLY: Nature's calling. I think we should pull over soon.  ,3,22
"SCULLY: You wake me up on a Saturday morning, tell me to be ready in five minutes, my mother is out of town, all of the dog sitters are booked, and you know how I feel about kennels. So unless you want to lose your security deposit on the car, I suggest you pull over.  ",3,22
SCULLY: I know I'm lost as to why you're so interested in this missing persons case.  ,3,22
"SCULLY: It's not jurisdiction that I'm questioning, Mulder.  ",3,22
SCULLY: So you think that there's a serial killer at large?  ,3,22
"SCULLY: (Sees a sign, 'What's Bigger Than the Sky?') What are you leaving out?  ",3,22
"SCULLY: Most missing persons cases are not that uncommon, Mulder. Why this one warrants us flying halfway across the country and driving for two hours is a total mystery. (Sees another sign). Oh, tell me you're not serious? (Car drives past a sign, 'Big Blue. The Southern Serpent. Spot Him at Heuvelmans Lake.')  ",3,22
"SCULLY: According to the Sheriff's report, you were the last person to see Dr Bailey alive.  ",3,22
SCULLY: I understand you argued over an endangered species petition.  ,3,22
"SCULLY: You sound bitter, Dr Farraday.  ",3,22
"SCULLY: Well, aside from having a motive, you don't seem too upset by any of this.  ",3,22
"SCULLY: And Lake Champagne, Lalavack Iceland...  ",3,22
"SCULLY: I did as a kid. But, then I grew up, and became a scientist.  ",3,22
SCULLY: An aquatic dinosaur.  ,3,22
"SCULLY: You know why? Because those creatures don't exist, Mulder. They're folk tales born out of some collective fear of the unknown.  ",3,22
SCULLY: It looks like an insect casing or Scarab or something from a beetle.  ,3,22
"SCULLY: No, we're with the FBI. We're investingating a pair of missing persons reports.  ",3,22
SCULLY: That's quite a story.  ,3,22
SCULLY: Those stories must sell a lot of T-shirts.  ,3,22
"SCULLY: Well, his fly's undone.  ",3,22
"SCULLY: No, most drowning victims are found with high levels of alchohol in their blood and their fly's unzipped. While urinating over the sides of boats, docks or whatever, they lose their balance, fall in and drown.  ",3,22
SCULLY: Maybe not so big.  ,3,22
"SCULLY: Well, fish eat decomposing matter, any body that 's been suspended in this environment for a period of time is going to become a food source. We eat fish, and fish eat us.  ",3,22
SCULLY: Mulder? This is Sheriff Lance Heads.  ,3,22
SCULLY: (Her dog tugs at the leash.) Queequeg.  ,3,22
SCULLY: We'd need irrefutable proof.  ,3,22
"SCULLY: Mulder, a creature as large as the one you're looking for would have left considerably deeper impressions. (The dog yanks so hard on the leash, Scully is pulled with it, and Queeqeg runs through the woods, right to Ted's boot.) Queeqeg! Queequeg come back here! Queequeg! Mulder? Sherrif, come take a look at this.  ",3,22
SCULLY: There's your lake monster Mulder.  ,3,22
SCULLY: It's all a hoax?  ,3,22
"SCULLY: Well, it's hard to tell without an autopsy, but it looks like propellor damage from a motor boat.  ",3,22
"SCULLY: Mulder, look at it out there. It's like rush hour.  ",3,22
"SCULLY: For all we know, he stepped in something and bled into those funny shoes of his. He's probably so embarrased right now, he doesn't want to show his face.  ",3,22
"SCULLY: Regardless of what I believe, there's no hard evidence to what you believe.  ",3,22
"SCULLY: He's right, Mulder. Those two sets of remains we found so far are inconclusive. We really need to find this body.  ",3,22
"SCULLY: Are you okay, Sheriff?  ",3,22
"SCULLY: I agree with you, I just wish that he gave us something more.  ",3,22
"SCULLY: Yeah, it could be a lot of things, Mulder. Fifteen years of fruitless hinting and the only thing the guy comes up with is a blurry picture of the monster's tooth?  ",3,22
"SCULLY: Mulder, they're just a bunch of poorly composed tory shots.  ",3,22
SCULLY: A tooth? I'm taking Queequeg for a walk.  ,3,22
"SCULLY: I'm fine. (Revealing her gun.) Goodnight, Mulder.  ",3,22
"SCULLY: (Tugs at the leash while Queequeg is barking frantically.) Come on, Queequeg. Queequeg, we're not going to go into the woods. Come on, do your business. I thought you had to go. Queequeg! What is it? Queequeg! Where are you going? (The dog breaks free and runs into the woods, Scully follows the leash with a torch.) Queequeg! Come back here! Queequeg! Queequeg? Queequeg! Quee... (The leash returns, and to Scully's horror, Queequeg is gone.)  ",3,22
SCULLY: Mulder...  ,3,22
SCULLY: Could you repeat the last part again? I kind of faded out.  ,3,22
SCULLY: After you said I'm sorry?  ,3,22
"SCULLY: (On the boat.) It's too bad we're not out here fishing. (Looking at a fish radar, showing many fish near the boat.)  ",3,22
"SCULLY: You really expect to find this thing, don't you Mulder?  ",3,22
SCULLY: I'll take that as a yes.  ,3,22
"SCULLY: You know, on the old mariner's maps, the cartographers would designate uncharted territories by writing 'Here Be Monsters'.  ",3,22
SCULLY: What was that? (A huge blob appears on the radar screen.)  ,3,22
"SCULLY: What is that? What is that, Mulder?  ",3,22
SCULLY: It looks like it's coming straight at us.  ,3,22
SCULLY: (Talking on the radio.) Mayday! Mayday! Can anybody hear me? This is the Patricia Rae. CA78327. Mayday! Mayday!  ,3,22
SCULLY: There goes our five hundred dollar deposit.  ,3,22
SCULLY: Swim?  ,3,22
SCULLY: In which direction? (Swings here lantern around)  ,3,22
"SCULLY: Living in the city you forget a lot of things. You know what I was just thinking about, being mugged or hit by a car, It's not until you get back to nature that you realize that everything is out to get you. So my father always told me to respect nature, because it has no respect for you. (A ripple moves through the water.)  ",3,22
"SCULLY: So what if it was. Mulder, what are we doing here?  ",3,22
SCULLY: What are you hoping to accomplish?  ,3,22
SCULLY: What for?  ,3,22
"SCULLY: Is that really the reason why? You know when you showed me those pictures the photographer took, you want to know what I really saw in them?  ",3,22
"SCULLY: No, you. That man is your future. Listening only to himself, hoping to catch a glimpse of the truth, for who knows what reason.  ",3,22
"SCULLY: Well, as dumb as it sounds, at least it's a legitimate reason.  ",3,22
"SCULLY: Mulder, sometimes I just can't figure them out.(A noise is heard, they jump up, their guns aimed, but it is only a duck. Scully lets out a sob.)  ",3,22
"SCULLY: Well as much as the very idea is abhorrent to me, I suppose under certain conditions a living entity is practically conditioned to perform whatever extreme measures are necessary to ensure its survival. I suppose I'm no different.  ",3,22
"SCULLY: Well, actually I have, thanks for...(she glares at him.)  ",3,22
SCULLY: Poor Queequeg.  ,3,22
"SCULLY: It was the name of the harpoonist in Moby Dick. My father used to read to me from Moby Dick when I was a little girl, I called him Ahab and he called me Starbuck. So I named my dog Queequeg. It's funny, I just realized something.  ",3,22
"SCULLY: No, how much you're like Ahab. You're so consumed by your personal vengeance against life, whether it be its inherent cruelties or mysteries, everything takes on a warped significance to fit your megalomaniacal cosmology.  ",3,22
"SCULLY: It's the truth or a white whale. What difference does it make? I mean, both obsessions are impossible to capture, and trying to do so will only leave you dead along with everyone else you bring with you. You know Mulder, you are Ahab.  ",3,22
SCULLY: And that's not flippant?  ,3,22
SCULLY: What was that? (A ripple in the water is heard)  ,3,22
SCULLY: Dr Farraday?  ,3,22
"SCULLY: No, no. we had a little trouble with our boat.  ",3,22
SCULLY: It was my fault. We would have been out here all night if you hadn't answered our distress call.  ,3,22
SCULLY: Walking by?  ,3,22
SCULLY: What exactly is it that you're doing out here Dr Farraday? It's well after midnight.  ,3,22
SCULLY: This is Striker's Cove?  ,3,22
SCULLY: A human?  ,3,22
"SCULLY: Well captain, what now?  ",3,22
"SCULLY: Sheriff, Agent Mulder and I would appreciate it if you could spare two or three of your men to assist us here.  ",3,22
SCULLY: What was that?  ,3,22
"SCULLY: I think you nipped an artery. We've got to get him to a hospital, he's losing blood. Give me your belt.  ",3,22
"SCULLY: Mulder, help is coming. Mulder!  ",3,22
SCULLY: He'll be fine. How are you?  ,3,22
"SCULLY: Well, you slued the big white whale, Ahab.  ",3,22
SCULLY: How can you be disappointed? That alligator would have gone through half the local population if you hadn't killed it.  ,3,22
"SCULLY: Well, there's still hope. That's why these missing stories have endured. People want to believe. (As they turn away, they miss a creature moving through the water - Big Blue)  ",3,22
"SCULLY: Sorry, I would've gotten here sooner but the Beltway was a parking lot. What's going on?  ",3,23
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,3,23
SCULLY: Does he have a history of mental illness?  ,3,23
"SCULLY: So, what's the X-File?  ",3,23
SCULLY: And police found no other motive for either of these attacks?  ,3,23
SCULLY: Hi.  ,3,23
SCULLY: You're the physician in charge?  ,3,23
SCULLY: Has he been sedated?  ,3,23
"SCULLY: You said you got this case last night, where did it come from?  ",3,23
SCULLY: Who?  ,3,23
SCULLY: And you're not suspicious that we're being used?  ,3,23
SCULLY: How'd you get in here?  ,3,23
SCULLY: Mulder.  ,3,23
"SCULLY: All I see are recordings of cable news shows. They're all dated and in chronological order. You know, that's what Patnik was watching at the hospital when he went all wiggy.  ",3,23
SCULLY: You're the one who's interested.  ,3,23
SCULLY: I'm going to show you something.  ,3,23
"SCULLY: Among other things, a one-hour special report on the atrocities in Bosnia, a report that prominently features Lladoslav Miriskovic.  ",3,23
"SCULLY: And my guess is that once I review the tapes for the night that Patnik killed his wife, that I'll find that report there as well.  ",3,23
"SCULLY: Well, recent studies have linked violence on television to violent behavior.  ",3,23
"SCULLY: But they believe that the causal connections are there, Mulder.  ",3,23
"SCULLY: All I'm saying is that I think it's clear that, that the programs that Patnik watched somehow triggered his violent behavior.  ",3,23
"SCULLY: The doctor suggested amphetamine abuse. Maybe that coupled with, with the disturbing images he was watching, pushed him over the edge.  ",3,23
"SCULLY: Okay, then how do you explain it?  ",3,23
SCULLY: Where are you going?  ,3,23
"SCULLY: No, I'm going to... watch the rest of these tapes. Just out of curiosity.  ",3,23
SCULLY: Yeah.  ,3,23
"SCULLY: Yeah, I'll be right there.  ",3,23
SCULLY: The car's been moved. Did you take it out last night?  ,3,23
"SCULLY: Nothing. Nothing, let's go see the crime scene.  ",3,23
SCULLY: What happened?  ,3,23
SCULLY: That blonde?  ,3,23
"SCULLY: So, this woman killed her husband because she thought he was cheating on her?  ",3,23
"SCULLY: Yeah, let's check it out.  ",3,23
SCULLY: I think television plays a large part in both of these murderers' lives.  ,3,23
SCULLY: More tapes.  ,3,23
"SCULLY: Mulder, what are you doing?  ",3,23
SCULLY: What is it?  ,3,23
SCULLY: Maybe it's a job for Special Agent Pendrell and the Sci-Crime lab.  ,3,23
"SCULLY: No, that's, that's fine, I'm...  ",3,23
SCULLY: Where are you?  ,3,23
SCULLY: I'm here.  ,3,23
"SCULLY: So, you had it analyzed?  ",3,23
"SCULLY: I just talked to Agent Pendrell, he said that you never showed up.  ",3,23
SCULLY: Then where were you?  ,3,23
SCULLY: What was that?  ,3,23
"SCULLY: There, that noise.  ",3,23
SCULLY: Mulder...  ,3,23
"SCULLY: I told you, Mom. He's here to kill me.  ",3,23
SCULLY: Just step back.  ,3,23
"SCULLY: It's not the truth, Mom. He's lied to me from the beginning.  ",3,23
SCULLY: You're in on it. You're one of them. You're one of the people who abducted me. You put that thing in my neck. You killed my sister!  ,3,23
SCULLY: It is.  ,3,23
"SCULLY: Mom, just get out of the way!  ",3,23
SCULLY: Ashamed.  ,3,23
SCULLY: I thought you were going to kill me.  ,3,23
SCULLY: I'm not following.  ,3,23
"SCULLY: Like me thinking that you'd betray me. I was so far gone, Mulder, I thought that you had gone to the other side.  ",3,23
"SCULLY: That Cancer Man, the man who smokes all those cigarettes, I was sure that I saw the two of you sitting in your car in the motel parking lot. You were reporting to him, you handed him a videotape. I'm... it was crazy.  ",3,23
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,3,23
SCULLY: You think it could be him?  ,3,23
"SCULLY: I'm sorry I'm late, I just got back from the document section.  ",3,23
"SCULLY: The cable company employee had no criminal record. In fact, there was nothing remarkable about him whatsoever. We found a medical license under the name ""Doctor Stroman"" in Falls Church, Virginia. He died in 1978.  ",3,23
SCULLY: Where are the wounded?  ,3,24
"SCULLY: I'm FBI, where are the people who were shot?  ",3,24
"SCULLY: Excuse me, I'm Special Agent Scully, FBI.  I wanna talk to somebody who can tell me what happened.  ",3,24
SCULLY: What did you see?  ,3,24
SCULLY: You were shot?  ,3,24
SCULLY: What man?  ,3,24
SCULLY: What did he do?  ,3,24
SCULLY: Who?  ,3,24
SCULLY: He's gone.  ,3,24
"SCULLY: Well nobody let him leave, he was in custody, and they were talking to him and then somehow he just disappeared.  ",3,24
SCULLY: Without a trace.  ,3,24
SCULLY: And you talked to him personally?  ,3,24
"SCULLY: The nurse said she had a stroke. They don't know yet the nature of severity, but the doctor's on his way down.  ",3,24
"SCULLY: Mulder I don't wanna jump to conclusions.  I don't want you to think the worst, people recover from those situations all the time.  ",3,24
SCULLY: I think she wants something to write on. [Scully hands her note pad and a pen] [she writes PALM]  ,3,24
"SCULLY: She's had what's called a subarachnoid hemorrhage, but they're very hopeful because the circulation was restored so quickly. She's gonna be under constant supervision at the Best Care up in Providence. It could be a lot worse.  ",3,24
SCULLY: Are you ok?  ,3,24
SCULLY: Correlation?  ,3,24
"SCULLY: I'm sorry, I.. I don't understand.  ",3,24
"SCULLY: Mulder, there's no deep mystery here. Your mother is at the.. the right age for something like this to happen.  ",3,24
"SCULLY: Well there could be several reasons huh..but to be honest, I don't think it means anything, her brain and her thought processes have been.. have been radically changed by what's happened. It could have very well affected her center of speech, her language.  ",3,24
"SCULLY: I'm sure it can, and will be Mulder, I'm gonna drive you to the nearest motel, it's been a very long day.  ",3,24
SCULLY: To do what?  ,3,24
SCULLY: Did they get anything on the man on question?  ,3,24
SCULLY: Whoa what happened there?  ,3,24
SCULLY: Yeah..  ,3,24
SCULLY: Could that be another detective?  ,3,24
SCULLY: Where are you going?  ,3,24
SCULLY: Mulder you haven't slept in almost 24 hours.  ,3,24
SCULLY: Sir? Excuse me but..  ,3,24
SCULLY: Are you Jeremiah Smith?  ,3,24
"SCULLY: Huh, would you come with me sir.  ",3,24
"SCULLY: There were reports, somewhat fantastic reports about what happened next.  ",3,24
"SCULLY: You haven't done anything wrong, sir  ",3,24
SCULLY: Where have you been?  ,3,24
SCULLY: What are you talking about?  ,3,24
"SCULLY: Mulder he just came in yesterday, he just turned himself in.  ",3,24
SCULLY: He.. he gave a statement.  ,3,24
SCULLY: He works for the social security administration.  ,3,24
SCULLY: No I lost him.  ,3,24
SCULLY: Who is it?  ,3,24
"SCULLY [she reaches for her gun, and slowly approaches the door, it's him alright] I want you to put your hands up where I can see them.  [he does it] Ok, I want you to keep your hands up, I'm gonna unlock the door. I want you to count to 5, come in, close the door and lock it behind you. [she unlocks delicately and gets back, away from the door]  ",3,24
SCULLY: Keep your hands up please.  ,3,24
SCULLY: Why didn't you tell me before?  ,3,24
SCULLY: Who are you?  ,3,24
SCULLY: Yeah.  ,3,24
SCULLY: Mulder where are you?  ,3,24
"SCULLY: Mulder listen to me, there's somebody here, somebody you need to talk to.  ",3,24
SCULLY: Jeremiah Smith.  ,3,24
SCULLY: Where?  ,3,24
"SCULLY: Mulder, he knows about your sister.  ",3,24
SCULLY: But how?  ,3,24
"SCULLY: Mulder, he knows about your sister.  ",4,1
"SCULLY: Stop right there, sir!  ",4,1
SCULLY: Mulder!  ,4,1
SCULLY: Mulder! Mulder!  ,4,1
SCULLY: Uh... I don't know...  ,4,1
"SCULLY: Please, I don't know.  ",4,1
SCULLY: Scully.  ,4,1
"SCULLY: I'm right where you left me, Mulder.  ",4,1
SCULLY: Because you wouldn't answer your phone and because I didn't know what else to do.  ,4,1
"SCULLY: Yes, I'm fine.  ",4,1
SCULLY: Mulder...  ,4,1
"SCULLY: Mulder, he's coming after you.  ",4,1
SCULLY: The man you left for dead.  ,4,1
SCULLY: Sir.  ,4,1
SCULLY: I heard that you were looking for me.  ,4,1
"SCULLY: We're fine, sir. We've been searching for this man, Jeremiah Smith.  ",4,1
SCULLY: No.  ,4,1
"SCULLY: I'm afraid we haven't exactly formulated any clear suspicions, sir.  ",4,1
SCULLY: Sir?  ,4,1
SCULLY: How much of it is there?  ,4,1
SCULLY: Could it be some kind of cryptograph?  ,4,1
SCULLY: I'd like to get a copy of a portion of this. I might be able to figure it out.  ,4,1
SCULLY: Maybe. There's somebody I want to run it by.  ,4,1
"SCULLY: No. I think, sir, this is more along my field of expertise.  ",4,1
SCULLY: How did you know I was here?  ,4,1
SCULLY: I don't know.  ,4,1
SCULLY: Concern him how?  ,4,1
SCULLY: Has something happened to her?  ,4,1
SCULLY: Is she in danger?  ,4,1
SCULLY: From whom?  ,4,1
SCULLY: Not until you give me some information first.  ,4,1
SCULLY: All beginning with the letters S-E-P. You know what these are. Confirm or deny.  ,4,1
SCULLY: Smallpox?  ,4,1
SCULLY: What's that supposed to mean?  ,4,1
"SCULLY: Are you busy, Agent Pendrell?  ",4,1
"SCULLY: Good, because I think I've made some headway on this data. Can you call up the files?  ",4,1
"SCULLY: ""SEP."" Smallpox Eradication Program.  ",4,1
"SCULLY: I got lucky, but the key is in this first string of letters.  ",4,1
"SCULLY: You say ""a twenty-letter code"" to any scientist, and they immediately think ""protein amino acid sequence..."" which is what this turned out to be.  ",4,1
SCULLY: Cowpox virus... the virus used to inoculate humans against smallpox.  ,4,1
"SCULLY: I haven't worked that out yet, but the big question is this second alphanumeric string.  ",4,1
SCULLY: An inventory.  ,4,1
SCULLY: Of us.  ,4,1
"SCULLY: Actually, it's an image created by what's called a confocal microscope. You're looking at a three-dimensional picture of the location of a protein. In this case, cowpox structural protein number six. It's one of the inoculants used in smallpox vaccines.  ",4,1
"SCULLY: From me. I had a biopsy taken from the smallpox vaccination scar on my upper arm. Through a process called immunohisto chemical staining and through the addition of an antibody for the cowpox virus six, I was able to get this picture of the location of a protein... a single, non-random, protein pattern.  ",4,1
SCULLY: What I'm saying is that I think this protein is a tag... some kind of genetic marker that was applied to me when I was inoculated against smallpox as a child.  ,4,1
SCULLY: Not just me... all of us... quite possibly anybody who's been inoculated over the past fifty years.  ,4,1
SCULLY: I had my doubts... and I'm still not certain. But I performed the same procedure on Agent Pendrell.  ,4,1
"SCULLY: I don't know, but it would have to be a government agency.  ",4,1
"SCULLY: I don't know that either, and I think the only man who might be able to give us that information is Jeremiah Smith.  ",4,1
"SCULLY: I am a scientist, sir. What I'm promoting in there is reductive evidence. It's the reason I believe I was assigned to the X-Files in the first place, is it not? To put Agent Mulder's work to the test of science?  ",4,1
"SCULLY: I'm in Skinner's office, where are you?  ",4,1
SCULLY: Just tell me where.  ,4,1
"SCULLY: Mulder, I don't...  ",4,1
SCULLY: Who?  ,4,1
"SCULLY: Oh, believe me, Mulder, you're going to have it.  ",4,1
SCULLY: There's a lot of people who want to talk to Jeremiah Smith.  ,4,1
SCULLY: Something's wrong. Something happened.  ,4,1
"SCULLY: Oh, my God... Mulder...  ",4,1
"SCULLY: Oh, dear... no... he's freezing. He's in, you're in shock, Mulder.  ",4,1
"SCULLY: As long as she's lying here, you can't give up on her. I don't care what the doctors say.  ",4,1
"SCULLY: We don't know that, Mulder. You can't blame yourself for what you could only hope.  ",4,1
SCULLY: I've seen things too. But there are answers to be found now. We have hope that there's a place to start. That's what I believe.  ,4,1
"SCULLY: Nothing happens in contradiction to nature, only in contradiction to what we know of it. And that's a place to start. That's where the hope is.  ",4,1
SCULLY: I feel it too. I know it.  ,4,1
SCULLY: I was warned...  ,4,1
SCULLY: Have the local police been contacted by this woman's abductor? No demand for ransom?  ,4,2
SCULLY: Any additional leads?  ,4,2
SCULLY: I'm still not sure how you and I figure into this investigation.  ,4,2
SCULLY: I assume that was taken by whoever it was who abducted her.  ,4,2
"SCULLY: Well, whoever it was that took this photo was obviously privy to the woman's abduction.  ",4,2
SCULLY: Is that where you keep it?  ,4,2
SCULLY: Mind if I take a look?  ,4,2
SCULLY: Your film's out of date.  ,4,2
"SCULLY: No, I was just making an observation.  ",4,2
"SCULLY: All right, so he doesn't exactly stand out as a suspect. Mulder, take a look at this. See this smeariness here. I'm thinking that it's heat damage. With the heater sitting under the film right there, the emulsion probably melted.  ",4,2
"SCULLY: Plus, the film is two years out of date.  ",4,2
"SCULLY: The, the photographic chemistry could have changed. The, the dyes ... fade, they ... all right, so what's your theory?  ",4,2
SCULLY: She was a postal employee?  ,4,2
SCULLY: Mary LeFante's passport photo. Do you know how soon she wanted to leave town? (Puett shakes his head) Did she know about your investigation?  ,4,2
SCULLY: And you think that she faked her own disappearance?  ,4,2
SCULLY: So you're thinking this woman planted that photo of herself in the drugstore?  ,4,2
"SCULLY: (shrugs, puzzled) I ...  ",4,2
SCULLY: What are you doing?  ,4,2
"SCULLY: ""Thoughtographs?""  ",4,2
SCULLY: So that makes it legitimate?  ,4,2
SCULLY: Oh my God!  ,4,2
SCULLY: Who was here?  ,4,2
"SCULLY: Psychic photography? Mulder, I think that it's obvious that somebody doctored these images and planted them to be found here. Maybe as some kind of a smokescreen.  ",4,2
SCULLY: Into their darkest fantasies.  ,4,2
SCULLY: Twilight sleep.  ,4,2
"SCULLY: No, it wouldn't.  ",4,2
SCULLY: (to the doctor) Give her a PET scan.  ,4,2
SCULLY: Oh my God.  ,4,2
SCULLY: She's been given what's called a transorbital lobotomy. It used to be known as an icepick lobotomy. It involves inserting a leucotome through the eye sockets.  ,4,2
"SCULLY: Whoever did this, Mulder, did it wrong.  ",4,2
SCULLY: Mulder.  ,4,2
SCULLY: What about the missing woman?  ,4,2
SCULLY: What's her connection to the first victim?  ,4,2
"SCULLY: Yeah, the clock is running.  ",4,2
SCULLY: It might be significant as a word.  ,4,2
"SCULLY: ""Unrest.""  ",4,2
SCULLY: College.  ,4,2
"SCULLY: I'm working on these crime scene photos from the first abduction. If we're lucky, we're dealing with someone who gets a vicarious thrill from returning to the scene of a crime.  ",4,2
SCULLY: How do you know?  ,4,2
"SCULLY: Is that what we're looking for here, Mulder? More evidence of psychic photography?  ",4,2
SCULLY: I've got a bureau forensics team coming up from Detroit.  ,4,2
SCULLY: We haven't found any new psychic photos here either.  ,4,2
SCULLY: Wait a second.  ,4,2
SCULLY: I want to show you something.  ,4,2
"SCULLY: Right here. This. (she shows him a photo from the first crime scene that shows the same sign in the area) And look. It's the same company. What if the kidnapper was working construction at both sites? From these two vantage points, he would have been able to pick out the two women.  ",4,2
SCULLY: Where are you going to be?  ,4,2
"SCULLY: What if it's not, Mulder? This woman's time is running out.  ",4,2
SCULLY: What have you got?  ,4,2
SCULLY: What about day laborers?  ,4,2
SCULLY: Gather officers to canvas. (to Iskendarian) Which foreman was working the Midlothian Corporate Park?  ,4,2
SCULLY: Find out where he is today. I'll take that one. (She leaves.)  ,4,2
SCULLY: Hello? Hello? (she walks up a stairway onto a balcony that surrounds an open area below) Hello? (she hears some noises and heads toward them) Hello?  ,4,2
"SCULLY: Uh, I hope so. Are you the foreman?  ",4,2
SCULLY: (flashes her badge) I'm Special Agent Dana Scully. I'd like to ask you some questions about the day laborers that you hire.  ,4,2
"SCULLY: No, sir, not at all.  ",4,2
SCULLY: Excuse me. Sorry.  ,4,2
"SCULLY: (turning and walking away, answering her phone) Scully.  ",4,2
SCULLY: Yeah?  ,4,2
SCULLY: Unruhe. (Schnauz suddenly looks nervous. Scully draws her gun.) Stand where you are!  ,4,2
SCULLY: Don't move!  ,4,2
SCULLY: Stop or I'll shoot!  ,4,2
SCULLY: Hands behind your head! DO IT!  ,4,2
"SCULLY: Alice Brandt. The second woman that you abducted. That's her name, Gerry. Where is Alice Brandt?  ",4,2
"SCULLY: Tell us where she is, Gerry.  ",4,2
SCULLY: (showing him a plastic bag containing the leucotome) Explain this.  ,4,2
"SCULLY: No, you used this to kill the two men.  ",4,2
SCULLY: You used this on Mary LeFante.  ,4,2
SCULLY: Then why don't we get back to Alice Brandt. Where is she?  ,4,2
"SCULLY: It's over, Mulder.  ",4,2
SCULLY: What the hell does it matter?  ,4,2
SCULLY: I don't.  ,4,2
SCULLY: Mulder.  ,4,2
SCULLY: We just got a report of a strong-arm robbery. It's at the drugstore where the first victim disappeared.  ,4,2
SCULLY: (to the druggist) What happened?  ,4,2
SCULLY: (concluding her conversation with the druggist) Thank you. (she walks over to Mulder) It's Gerry.  ,4,2
"SCULLY: He also took morphine, scopolamine, hydrobromide and insulin syringes. He's making more twilight sleep.  ",4,2
"SCULLY: You know, that job site that I arrested him at, Mulder. What if he's ... what if he's already picked out his next victim? There were ... there were apartment buildings on all sides.  ",4,2
SCULLY: Let's go.  ,4,2
SCULLY: Corning.  ,4,2
SCULLY: Send units to the 300 block of Belmont Avenue. Check all of the apartments in the vicinity of that job site. I think he's heading back there.  ,4,2
SCULLY: Thanks.  ,4,2
SCULLY: Let me go.  ,4,2
"SCULLY: It's over, Gerry. Let me go right now.  ",4,2
SCULLY: Aufhören! [Stop!] Ich habe keine Unruhe. [I have no unrest.] Ich habe keine Unruhe. Ich brauche nicht gerettet zu werden. [I don't need to be saved.]  ,4,2
"SCULLY: Why? Why me, Gerry? Do I remind you of your sister? Why did your sister kill herself, Gerry? What did your father do to her?  ",4,2
"SCULLY: OK, then let's talk about the howlers.  ",4,2
"SCULLY: I don't have them, Gerry.  ",4,2
"SCULLY: What if you're wrong, Gerry?. What if there are no such things as howlers? What if you made them up inside your head to explain the things your sister said your father did?  ",4,2
"SCULLY: If there are such things as howlers, Gerry, they live only inside your head.  ",4,2
"SCULLY: It means you need help, Gerry.  ",4,2
"SCULLY: No, Gerry, stop!  ",4,2
SCULLY: Mulder! I'm in here!  ,4,2
SCULLY: Mulder! Help! Mulder!  ,4,2
"SCULLY: Addendum to case report. After his death, a diary was found among Gerald Schnauz's belongings, written in the second person and apparently intended as an open letter to his father. It includes the names of his victims, the women he desired to save. My name is contained in the last entry. I have no further explanation for the existence of the photographs, nor am I confident one is forthcoming. My captivity forced me to understand and even empathize with Gerry Schnauz. My survival depended on it. I see now the value of such insight. For truly to pursue monsters, we must understand them. (She picks up the photo of herself and studies it somberly) We must venture into their minds. Only in doing so, do we risk letting them venture into ours?  ",4,2
"SCULLY: Compression marks indicate the shovel blade to be approximately six and three-quarters inches. Uh, the angle of movement and deeper indentation on the right side of the mark suggests a left-handed individual.  ",4,3
"SCULLY: Mulder, if you had to do without a cell phone for two minutes, you'd lapse into catatonic schizophrenia.  ",4,3
SCULLY: Be like living in Mayberry.  ,4,3
"SCULLY: Do you have any thoughts or, uh, suspects?  ",4,3
"SCULLY: Well, were there any local women who were pregnant and now suddenly aren't?  ",4,3
SCULLY: You suppose?  ,4,3
SCULLY: Have you questioned the men?  ,4,3
"SCULLY: It is, however, the closest residence to the crime scene.  ",4,3
"SCULLY: Well, they could've witnessed...  ",4,3
"SCULLY: Uh, I could use a little more elbow room.  ",4,3
"SCULLY: Oh, my God... Mulder... it looks as if this child has been afflicted by every rare birth defect known to science. I mean, I, I'm going to have to order DNA typing from the crime lab, but... there appears to be abnormalities associated with Nev-Laxova Syndrome, Meckel-Gruber Syndrome, estrophy of the cloaca, I mean, I don't even know where to begin.  ",4,3
"SCULLY: Well, I don't know about that.  ",4,3
SCULLY: Imagine all a woman's hopes and dreams for her child and then nature turns so cruel. What must a mother go through?  ,4,3
"SCULLY: I, I guess I was just projecting on myself.  ",4,3
SCULLY: No.  ,4,3
SCULLY: What about your family?  ,4,3
"SCULLY: But from what I know from about genetic defects, Mulder, it's unlikely that child is a result of a single polygenic mating.  ",4,3
"SCULLY: Those defects, Mulder, are autosomal dominant disorders, and from the degree, I'd say, mutations that go back many generations.  ",4,3
SCULLY: But he also implied that they practice inbreeding. Now we all have a natural instinct to propagate...  ,4,3
"SCULLY: There are theories which pose that our bodies are, are simply vehicles for genes needing to  replicate.  ",4,3
"SCULLY: But if the instinct and the need is strong enough, they will answer it any way that they can.  Now a woman gave birth to that child, Mulder, and my guess is, against her will.  ",4,3
"SCULLY: No, there's no probable cause.  ",4,3
"SCULLY: And check any prior missing-persons for a woman, and check the vehicle identification number on that Cadillac.  ",4,3
SCULLY: What about missing persons reports?  ,4,3
SCULLY: Sheriff...  ,4,3
"SCULLY: Well, uh, we'll check on those in the morning. You get some sleep, Sheriff.  ",4,3
SCULLY: You still planning on making a home here?  ,4,3
"SCULLY: Well, just as long as a brutal infanticide doesn't weigh into your decision. Good night, Mulder.  ",4,3
"SCULLY: Mulder, this lock is broken.  ",4,3
SCULLY: Damn it. The lab screwed up the DNA test on the infant.  ,4,3
"SCULLY: Yeah, but this shows far too many gene imbalances. It would have to be a lab error.  ",4,3
"SCULLY: Mulder... only one sperm in thousands from a single individual can penetrate an ovum membrane, let alone from three separate males.  ",4,3
"SCULLY: No. For that to be even remotely possible, there'd, there'd have to be a weakening of the ovum, and that would have to come from a female member of the Peacock family, and there aren't any left.  ",4,3
"SCULLY: Mulder, that would take a whole day. I think they, they may have a woman captive up there who may have sustained life-threatening injuries while giving birth. Who knows what those men have done to her. I think that we should go up there right now.  ",4,3
"SCULLY: Hang on a second, Mulder. Why... why would the Peacocks kill Sheriff Taylor? He didn't even question them about the buried child.  ",4,3
"SCULLY: But how would they know? He, he issued the warrants by phone. Unless they overheard us talking about it, how would they know?  ",4,3
SCULLY: Exactly. How could they know?  ,4,3
"SCULLY: Yup, they're up there.  ",4,3
"SCULLY: Are these vests absolutely necessary, deputy?  ",4,3
SCULLY: I don't see anybody inside.  ,4,3
"SCULLY: Pastor, no!  ",4,3
"SCULLY: Even though we have the firearms, I imagine the place is rigged with traps.  ",4,3
"SCULLY: I don't know... ""nah-ram-ewe.""  ",4,3
"SCULLY: I baby-sat my nephew this weekend. He watches ""Babe"" fifteen times a day.  ",4,3
SCULLY: Federal agents! Is anybody in here!  ,4,3
SCULLY: Let's move the bed.  ,4,3
"SCULLY: Mulder, she already is home. It's Mrs. Peacock. She's their mother.  ",4,3
"SCULLY: Well, what about her?  ",4,3
"SCULLY: I mean, we, we may not be able to move her, Mulder. She doesn't appear to be held against her will. I mean, she appears to be, but I don't believe she is.  ",4,3
SCULLY: We're only assuming. We can't prove anything.  ,4,3
SCULLY: Mrs. Peacock?  ,4,3
SCULLY: Whatever pain you may be...  ,4,3
SCULLY: What about you? Even after the accident?  ,4,3
"SCULLY: Mrs. Peacock, they murdered Sheriff Taylor and his wife. And Deputy Pastor.  ",4,3
SCULLY: Mulder!  ,4,3
"SCULLY: Mulder, look.  ",4,3
"SCULLY: I've notified the state police and the highway patrol, they've put out an A.P.B. on the Peacocks and they're setting up a roadblock over a thirty-mile radius. In time, we'll catch them.  ",4,3
SCULLY: Theres not much traffic at this hour.  ,4,4
"SCULLY: Only what Ive read in the Herald. Uh, that four young men have gone missing over the past three months --- all of them African-American.  ",4,4
SCULLY: What happened last night?  ,4,4
SCULLY: How was he killed?  ,4,4
SCULLY: Has a cause of death been determined.  ,4,4
"SCULLY: Im sorry, I thought you said that Owen Sanders was black.  ",4,4
SCULLY: Im not sure I follow.  ,4,4
SCULLY: I assume youre going somewhere with this.  ,4,4
SCULLY: So you dont think these men are victims of a crime at all.  ,4,4
"SCULLY: Case number 2139318537. Subject is a black male, 19 years old, Cause and time of death unknown. Note: total lack of pigment in his skin, hair and eyes. The appearance of which suggests albinism, though the bleaching of the irises indicates a violent and unexplained cellular reaction to a vector or an environment. (Door opens, MULDER enters.)  ",4,4
SCULLY: His name was Owen Sanders. He was reported as the fourth kidnap victim in Philadelphia until his body turned up last night looking like this.  ,4,4
SCULLY: (tight smile) I have been requested to determine what leeched the pigment from his body.  ,4,4
SCULLY: The Centers for Disease Control.  ,4,4
"SCULLY: Well, they believe that the uh, the case has been mislabeled. That this man and the others may have fallen prey to a disease or a pathogen.  ",4,4
"SCULLY: There were no external signs of trauma or defense wounds and uh, his wallet was still full of cash.  ",4,4
SCULLY: I dont know. There are conditions like vitiligo which attack melanocytes and prevent the manufacture of melanin in the skin. Auto immune disorders which are not yet clearly understood.  ,4,4
"SCULLY: Well, its very possible that they have already turned up but because of the depigmentation there may have been a problem with identification, so I have reissued descriptions of John Does to area morgues and ERs.  ",4,4
SCULLY: Im sorry?  ,4,4
"SCULLY: Mulder, not everything is a labyrinth of dark conspiracy, and not everybody is plotting to deceive, inveigle and obfuscate.  ",4,4
SCULLY: (sighs)  ,4,4
"SCULLY: Yes, theres hair, skin, and fiber behind you on the counter. (He turns to look) What are you doing?  ",4,4
"SCULLY: (voice) If Im correct, its a cortical depressant that works on the higher centers of the brain.  ",4,4
SCULLY: (on phone in autopsy lab) In large enough quantities it might be. Larger than anything contained in a single seed.  ,4,4
"SCULLY: (Voice) No, the tox screen was clean.  ",4,4
SCULLY: (on phone) Only if the victim hadnt expired immediately.  ,4,4
"SCULLY: (on phone) No, but .... I think I found something that could explain the depigmentation in the victim. His pituitary gland was necrotized.  ",4,4
SCULLY: (on phone) The pituitary gland secretes all the regulatory hormones in the body and it controls the production of melanin in the skin cells.  ,4,4
SCULLY: (on phone) No. I have identified the effect. I am still looking for the cause.  ,4,4
"SCULLY: (on phone) Where are you, Mulder?  ",4,4
SCULLY: You mean he looked sick?  ,4,4
SCULLY: Did you observe anybody else in the area?  ,4,4
SCULLY: Excuse me.  ,4,4
SCULLY: We have another missing young man. His name is Alfred Kittel. 17 years old. Hes African American. His mother called the police around 3:00 this morning.  ,4,4
"SCULLY: He works at a fast food place down the street. He takes this bus every night, and last night he never made it home. They found his knapsack on the bench here. Police are out canvassing. I talked to a bus driver who said that he seemed disoriented and non-responsive which seems to me like it might be some kind of pre-symptomatic dementia.  ",4,4
SCULLY: What are you suggesting?  ,4,4
SCULLY: What makes you so sure?  ,4,4
SCULLY: It says here that the cause of death was undetermined.  ,4,4
"SCULLY: Sir, were not here to arrest anybody.  ",4,4
SCULLY: Yes. Investigating a possible public health crisis.  ,4,4
"SCULLY: (looking through file) It has to be here, Mulder. There has to be some evidence of a virus or bacterium.  ",4,4
SCULLY: The motive of any pathogen is to reproduce itself. And my job as a doctor is to find out if and how it is being transmitted.  ,4,4
SCULLY: Death is a health crisis. Something caused Owen Sanders pituitary to fail which in turn caused his metabolism to drop resulting in myaxadema coma and finally in death. Sometimes you have to start at the end to find the beginning. (MULDER is comparing picture of ABOAH to a group of construction workers.) I just hope we dont have to find another dead body to discover what that is.  ,4,4
SCULLY: Hes not here.  ,4,4
"SCULLY: Mulder, I think I know where he went. (Indicates hole in the fence.) Come on, Mulder. Lets go. Weve lost him.  ",4,4
"SCULLY: Oh, my god.  ",4,4
"SCULLY: With your permission, sir, Id like to examine him some more. Id like to run a suppression test, to do a TSH screen, take a history.  ",4,4
SCULLY: Im working on that.  ,4,4
SCULLY: Not yet. But that doesnt mean he isnt a carrier or even the index case.  ,4,4
"SCULLY: Nobody has lied to you, sir.  ",4,4
SCULLY: We would like to do some more tests on him. We have to be certain that his health hasnt been endangered and that he isnt endangering others.  ,4,4
SCULLY: As a translator. Wed like to be able to ask him some questions.  ,4,4
SCULLY: There are no charges against Mr. Aboah.  ,4,4
SCULLY: Where are you going?  ,4,4
"SCULLY: This patient appears to have something in his throat, some kind of aberrant bone growth, or maybe something foreign lodged in his esophagus.  ",4,4
"SCULLY: Well, thats only part of it. I discovered something even more disturbing when his PET series came back. Look right here on the sagittal section, right below the hypothalamus.  ",4,4
SCULLY: Theres no mistake. This patient has no pituitary gland.  ,4,4
"SCULLY: I cant even begin to explain what were seeing here, sir. I just hope this patient can, can provide us with some of the answers.  ",4,4
SCULLY: What are you talking about?  ,4,4
"SCULLY: (on cel phone) When did this happen? ..... Thank you, Lieutenant. I appreciate it. (hangs up) Mulder .....  ",4,4
SCULLY: Lets go. That was the Philadelphia PD. Marcus Duffs car turned up abandoned with the keys in the ignition and the hood still hot.  ,4,4
SCULLY: Do you know what happened to him?  ,4,4
SCULLY: What about Aboah? Any indication of where he might be?  ,4,4
"SCULLY: Hes got to be around here somewhere, Mulder. He cant have gotten far.  ",4,4
SCULLY: Theyll find him.  ,4,4
SCULLY: How do you know?  ,4,4
SCULLY: Interrupted his killing Duff?  ,4,4
SCULLY: What need?  ,4,4
"SCULLY: Theoretically, yes.  ",4,4
SCULLY: Considering his PET scan results I dont even know how he managed to stay alive.  ,4,4
SCULLY: What are you talking about?  ,4,4
"SCULLY: What, by stealing other peoples hormones?  ",4,4
"SCULLY: Well, however hes managed to survive wha --- I mean what.... what makes you think hes not an isolated case?  ",4,4
SCULLY: So youre basing this theory on a folktale?  ,4,4
"SCULLY: Well, even if youre right, I mean especially if youre right, why would he leave his own country to come here?  ",4,4
SCULLY: What are you doing?  ,4,4
"SCULLY: Why are we here, Mulder?  ",4,4
SCULLY: (in another part of the building) Mulder?  ,4,4
"SCULLY: Mulder? Mulder? (Climbs same ladder) Mulder? (Sees his dropped flashlight, and vent nearby. Looks in vent.) Mulder? (Climbs through vent. ABOAH watches her through grate. SCULLY sees pale dead KITTEL. Then sees MULDER. She crawls to him.) Mulder! Mulder, are you okay?  ",4,4
"SCULLY: Its okay, Mulder. Im here, okay?  ",4,4
"SCULLY: Sorry, Mulder. (Drops him to ground, then dials cel phone, her back to MULDER.) Yes, this is Dana Scully with the FBI requesting immediate EMS and police assistance. Im in Liberty Plaza ....... My badge number? JTT0331613.  ",4,4
SCULLY: (on phone with 911 operator from hell) No. Liberty Plaza. Theres a demolition site on the north side of the street.  ,4,4
"SCULLY: (voice over) Special Agent Dana Scully, Field Journal Entry number 74. Despite acute trauma to his pituitary gland, Marcus Duff was discharged early this morning from Mt. Zion Medical Center. He is expected to testify before a Grand Jury in the capital case against Samuel Aboah who is being charged with five counts of murder. (Aboah in hospital room.) It remains uncertain, however, whether Aboah will live long enough to stand trial. His response to hormone therapy has been poor, his deterioration progressive. My conviction remains intact that that the mechanism by which Aboah killed and in turn survived, can only be explained by medical science, and that science will eventually discover his place in the broader context of evolution. But what science may never be able to explain is our ineffable fear of the alien among us; a fear which often drives us not to search for understanding, but to deceive, inveigle, and obfuscate. To obscure the truth not only from others, but from ourselves.  ",4,4
SCULLY: He's somewhere here on the compound.  ,4,5
SCULLY: We have to find him.  ,4,5
SCULLY: Where haven't we covered?  ,4,5
SCULLY: Mulder. Mulder!  ,4,5
SCULLY: How did you know that?  ,4,5
SCULLY: We believe that Ephesian is a paranoid charismatic sociopath. He is obsessed with the book of Revelation and will use his knowledge of biblical text to get anything that he wants from his followers.  ,4,5
"SCULLY: Vernon, if Sidney was unfaithful, did he receive a ""crown of life?""  ",4,5
"SCULLY: Skinner said no one else has come up with anything. As you can see, they've started to release members of the temple.  ",4,5
"SCULLY: Melissa, do you understand your right to have an attorney present in this questioning?  ",4,5
"SCULLY: What about your family, where do they live?  ",4,5
SCULLY: How long have you lived there?  ,4,5
SCULLY: How long have you been married to Ephesian?  ,4,5
"SCULLY: That's quite a faith you have in Vernon there, Melissa. I'd have a tough time if my husband had so many children with other women.  ",4,5
"SCULLY: Have you ever witnessed any child abuse at the temple, Melissa?  ",4,5
SCULLY: Melissa?  ,4,5
SCULLY: You're claiming Sidney is her past life just because she mentioned Joe McCarthy?  ,4,5
SCULLY: Melissa Riedal is not cooperating.  ,4,5
SCULLY: They're extremely rare.  ,4,5
"SCULLY: I believe the disorder exists, but in this case, under these circumstances, I would have to know more.  ",4,5
"SCULLY: Yes, but we are responsible for Melissa Riedal.  ",4,5
SCULLY: You didn't even have the courage to tell Skinner what you really believe... that Melissa Riedal is being invaded by her past-life incarnations.  ,4,5
"SCULLY: I don't believe that you feel responsible for those fifty lives... or Melissa Riedal. You are only responsible to yourself, Mulder.  ",4,5
"SCULLY: We know that events occurred here that, uh, that may be painful. You may not want to talk about them. They may be so painful, you may be afraid to remember. But to help the others... to help the children and to help yourself... we're here with you to listen. To Melissa, to ""Sidney,"" to whoever may need to talk.  ",4,5
SCULLY: What should I call you?  ,4,5
SCULLY: Lily... were any of your friends hurt in this room?  ,4,5
"SCULLY: Melissa, Lily... it's okay to tell me.  ",4,5
SCULLY: What's wrong?  ,4,5
SCULLY: That's why they weren't on the A.T.F. reports.  ,4,5
SCULLY: Who are you calling?  ,4,5
SCULLY: Because hypnosis is used in the treatment of dissociative identities to bring forth a patient's various personalities?  ,4,5
"SCULLY: No, it's about regressing her to a past life.  ",4,5
"SCULLY: And why is it that Vernon Ephesian is, reported by you, a paranoid sociopath because he believes that he lived in Greece a hundred years ago, and you're not, even though you believe you died in that field?  ",4,5
SCULLY: Maybe there's a map of the battlefield down in the records.  ,4,5
SCULLY: Mulder...  ,4,5
"SCULLY: Mulder, this is a product of her illness. She couldn't answer the question of the battlefield. She gave us no specific names, no information to prove her validity. There is nothing we can do to prove that this is the truth.  ",4,5
"SCULLY: Mulder, Ephesian's arraignment is in two hours. There is no time to be doing this.  ",4,5
"SCULLY: Mulder, it's Scully. Do you see any bunkers in the field?  ",4,5
SCULLY: Ephesian's being taken down to his arraignment. He and Melissa are going to be released soon.  ,4,5
"SCULLY: Even if I knew for certain, I wouldn't change a day.  ",4,5
SCULLY: I've reported to investigators on the site about the possible existence of other bunkers.  ,4,5
"SCULLY: It's not the property of the Seven Stars, so the B.A.T.F. is continuing to search.  ",4,5
SCULLY: Revelations tells of Christian faith defeating that army.  ,4,5
SCULLY: Ephesian knew that he couldn't defeat us.  ,4,5
"SCULLY: First epistle of John, Chapter Three: ""He laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.""  ",4,5
"SCULLY: Mulder, no! You're dead!  ",4,5
"SCULLY: Doctor Lloyd, are you currently taking any kind of medication?  ",4,6
"SCULLY: Would you mind allowing me to check the dosage, and which ones?  ",4,6
"SCULLY: Doctor Lloyd, you say that youve taken sleeping pills. How much sleep did you get the night before?  ",4,6
SCULLY: The sleeping pill he was taking was something called Somanil.  ,4,6
SCULLY: Its popular because it works directly on the central nervous system and it isnt stored in body tissue past its intended use. But its also very controversial for its addictivness and its effect on long term behavior.  ,4,6
"SCULLY: (reading folder) Well, he started taking the drug five years ago, and he went through  ooh, he took a lot of it. 19 one hundred tablet refills.  ",4,6
SCULLY: (still looking at folder) Yeah.  ,4,6
"SCULLY: You know, thats more than a pill a day.  ",4,6
SCULLY: An addiction which very well could have altered his ability to do his job.  ,4,6
"SCULLY: Judging from his schedule the day of the accident, hundreds, and probably thousands.  ",4,6
"SCULLY: Youre missing my point here, Mulder. This  this place is a veritable factory. Cosmetic surgery is the boom industry of the medical world. And ASU wards like this are a gold mine.  ",4,6
"SCULLY: And a brand new, state of the art facility like this can support an entire hospital.  ",4,6
SCULLY: What?  ,4,6
"SCULLY: Well, they look like they were made by, uh, the coasters from an OR table or some kind of equipment.  ",4,6
"SCULLY: (giving him *the look*) Mulder, if you want to connect the dots here, you should look at the facts. (MULDER rolls his eyes) Latrogenic deaths or  or deaths due to doctor error are upwards of 80,000 a year. Dr. Lloyd was pushing his limits. He was an accident waiting to happen.  ",4,6
SCULLY: Maybe they were all possessed.  ,4,6
"SCULLY: Uh, were with the FBI. Im Agent Scully, and this is Agent Mulder. Were investigating a patients death here.  ",4,6
SCULLY: (looking at NURSE WAITES name tag) Youre Rebecca Waite. You were the attending nurse at the time. Am I correct?  ,4,6
SCULLY: Could you explain to me what happened to Dr. Lloyd. How - how a mistake like this could happen?  ,4,6
SCULLY: Did you observe Dr. Lloyd at all before the accident?  ,4,6
"SCULLY: (holding badge) Uh, Dr. Shannon, can we have a word with you, please?  ",4,6
"SCULLY: Yeah, theres magic going on here, Mulder, only its being done with silicone, collagen, and a well placed scalpel.  ",4,6
SCULLY: You wanted to show me something?  ,4,6
"SCULLY: Stop it a second. (Tape show Lloyd stabbing with liposuction tool.) My god, Mulder. He basically stabbed the man to death in his sleep.  ",4,6
"SCULLY: Well, presuming that has anything to do with this, who would have put them there?  ",4,6
"SCULLY: Well, then it doesnt even make sense.  ",4,6
SCULLY: But theres no other evidence of anything like witchcraft taking place here.  ,4,6
SCULLY: The sleeping pills?  ,4,6
"SCULLY: ""An anti-spasmodic whose active ingredients include belladonna alkaloids ""  ",4,6
"SCULLY: Mulder, do you know how many pharmaceuticals listed in the PDR contain belladonna?  ",4,6
"SCULLY: Well, if its that simple, why dont you put out an APB for someone riding a broom and wearing a tall black hat?  ",4,6
"SCULLY: You dont remember anything, Dr. Ilaqua? How you got in the room, or what compelled you to do such a thing?  ",4,6
SCULLY: Do you realize what youve done now?  ,4,6
"SCULLY: (seeing prescription bottle in DR. ILAQUAS pocket.) May I? (removes bottle, and reads it) Ill be right back. (Exits, leaving him with a guard.)  ",4,6
"SCULLY: No, just Dr. Ilaqua, why?  ",4,6
SCULLY: What are they? Bruises?  ,4,6
"SCULLY: Well, I found something, too. (Hands MULDER prescription bottle.)  ",4,6
SCULLY: You think its just a coincidence?  ,4,6
"SCULLY: Sorry to barge in, but this is a matter of some urgency.  ",4,6
SCULLY: Finally.  ,4,6
SCULLY: Do you have any other reasons to suspect her?  ,4,6
SCULLY: On the suspicion of being a witch?  ,4,6
SCULLY: What could she have been doing in here?  ,4,6
"SCULLY: Mulder, dont ...  ",4,6
SCULLY: Get the paramedics over here! Get the paramedic over here now!  ,4,6
SCULLY: Shes swallowed straight pins and is bleeding internally. Youve got to get her into surgery immediately.  ,4,6
SCULLY: (to MULDER) Im going with her to the ER.  ,4,6
"SCULLY: (voice) Mulder, its me.  ",4,6
"SCULLY: I do? (She crosses to look at herself in the mirror and sighs) I was just at the hospital. Our suspect, Rebecca Waite was just pronounced 20 minutes ago.  ",4,6
SCULLY: Massive blood loss due to esophageal hemorrhaging caused by the expulsion of hundreds of straight pins.  ,4,6
"SCULLY: Well ... in med school I saw some weird stuff. (MULDER crosses over to witchcraft book.) Uh, theres a - a psychiatric disorder called pica which is characterized by the craving for non-food objects like clay, rocks, glue, but if she swallowed ...  ",4,6
SCULLY: (sitting beside MULDER on bed) Allotriophagy?  ,4,6
"SCULLY: Mulder, I - I wont refute that this woman may have been practicing the occult, but ... what comes out must first go in.  ",4,6
SCULLY: (indicating book) Whered you get this from?  ,4,6
SCULLY: Whats the significance of the 30th?  ,4,6
SCULLY: So you think she was choosing her victims based on their birthdays.  ,4,6
SCULLY: Which made her attack Dr. Franklyn.  ,4,6
"SCULLY: (on phone) Yes. Thank you. (hangs up) Dr. Franklyns already left, but his office confirms that one of his patients has a birth date which corresponds with one of the Sabbaths.  ",4,6
"SCULLY: This morning  shes already in pre-op, and one of the other doctors is filling in.  ",4,6
"SCULLY: It means that while doctors in other fields have seen their earnings fall because of managed health care, youve all managed to become wealthy.  ",4,6
SCULLY: So you covered it up.  ,4,6
"SCULLY: Why, Mulder? What are you thinking?  ",4,6
"SCULLY: Mulder, Im still not sure where youre going with this.  ",4,6
SCULLY: But Cox was a doctor. Nothing about his death matches up except its coincidence.  ,4,6
SCULLY: Where else do you think he would be?  ,4,6
SCULLY: Hes not answering his pages.  ,4,6
"SCULLY: Answering machine. What are you thinking, Mulder? That Dr. Cox murdered these patients ten years ago then became Dr. Franklyn?  ",4,6
SCULLY: This kind of transformation is medically impossible.  ,4,6
SCULLY: (The Look) Blood sacrifice?  ,4,6
SCULLY: So this man committed these murders in order to make himself beautiful?  ,4,6
"SCULLY: Look, hes inscribed all the names of the patients who were killed. (They see ""Shannon"" carved at one of the points.)  ",4,6
"SCULLY: Mulder, in here.  ",4,6
SCULLY: Where are you going?  ,4,6
SCULLY: (entering) You have to stop this procedure immediately.  ,4,6
SCULLY: Im Special Agent Dana Scully. Im an FBI agent. (Shows badge.)  ,4,6
SCULLY: Listen to me! Im a doctor.  ,4,6
SCULLY: Im a federal agent.  ,4,6
SCULLY: Thats exactly what Im trying to prevent.  ,4,6
"SCULLY: Well, they saved her life. They just pulled a whole whack of surgical instruments out of-of her intestinal tract. God only knows how they got there.  ",4,6
SCULLY: (grabs chart) October 31. Halloween.  ,4,6
"SCULLY: Look at you, you're shaking.  ",4,7
"SCULLY: Okay, okay. Now tell us what you're so close to.  ",4,7
"SCULLY: Yes, I am.  ",4,7
"SCULLY: By reputation. Um, he's an Oxford educated Psychologist, who wrote a monograph on serial killers and the occult, that helped to catch Monty Props in 1988. Generally thought of as the best analyst in the violent crimes section. He had a nickname at the academy... Spooky Mulder.  ",4,7
"SCULLY: Agent Mulder. I'm Dana Scully, I've been assigned to work with you.  ",4,7
"SCULLY: Actually, I'm looking forward to working with you. I've heard a lot about you.  ",4,7
SCULLY: Mulder...  ,4,8
SCULLY: You called for a forensic excavation at five A.M. on a Sunday? What are you looking for?  ,4,8
"SCULLY: Mulder, what are you doing out here?  ",4,8
SCULLY: You're saying that you're out here because of something you saw in a dream?  ,4,8
"SCULLY: So, tell me about this dream.  ",4,8
"SCULLY: Mulder, if you destroy evidence, we may never find out what happened here.  ",4,8
SCULLY: You're saying you got all these details from your dream?  ,4,8
SCULLY: Whose M.O.?  ,4,8
SCULLY: Did you?  ,4,8
SCULLY: But it was your profile that caught him.  ,4,8
"SCULLY: Well, if nothing else... I think I can at least help explain your dream.  ",4,8
"SCULLY: You said it yourself once. You said that a... a dream is an answer to a question we haven't learned how to ask. You did good work, Mulder. Let's identify this girl so we can put her to rest.  ",4,8
"SCULLY: I believe her name is Addie Sparks. She went missing from her home in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, in June of 1975. I contacted the Center For Missing and Exploited Children, ran a search through the database.  ",4,8
"SCULLY: The match is right, Mulder. The, the, the height is right, the description of the sleeper is right.  ",4,8
"SCULLY: Mulder, we're going to have to verify this. Are you up for that?  ",4,8
SCULLY: Frank Sparks?  ,4,8
"SCULLY: Yes, I'm Agent Scully, this is Agent Mulder. We're with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. May we speak with you?  ",4,8
"SCULLY: Where is your wife, sir?  ",4,8
"SCULLY: No, sir, not full-time.  ",4,8
SCULLY: What are you saying that means?  ,4,8
SCULLY: Maybe... you're saying the hearts might still be in his car?  ,4,8
SCULLY: Don't you think the car might have been searched at least once already?  ,4,8
SCULLY: Thank you.  ,4,8
SCULLY: Maybe it's underneath.  ,4,8
SCULLY: Addie Sparks.  ,4,8
SCULLY: We also found your cloth hearts. All sixteen of them.  ,4,8
"SCULLY: You're in here for life, you've got nothing to lose.  ",4,8
SCULLY: I did.  ,4,8
"SCULLY: In your dream, Mulder. It was a dream. Your mind made it up.  ",4,8
SCULLY: Is it a state secret you lived in Martha's Vineyard?  ,4,8
SCULLY: Through the prison library. The inmates have access to computers and the internet. I checked. Roche logged on just yesterday.  ,4,8
"SCULLY: The server records don't show, but on the Net, Mulder, he can find out practically anything about you. Look, he is playing with you, Mulder. He is committing emotional blackmail and you are letting him. You walked into that room with your heart on your sleeve. He saw vulnerability, and he took advantage of it. You had a dream... a nightmare... and you, and you had it because of all the emotions that this case is stirring up for you. But... it was nothing but a dream.  ",4,8
SCULLY: What are you saying you believe now?  ,4,8
"SCULLY: It is looking possible, sir. John Lee Roche apparently spent most of 1973 in Boston. He did take one sales trip up to Martha's Vineyard in October of that year. The timing is right.  ",4,8
"SCULLY: Sir, the fact remains that we still have two more victims that we need to find and identify, and no one has more insight into Roche than Agent Mulder and this is still Agent Mulder's case.  ",4,8
SCULLY: Prove it.  ,4,8
SCULLY: Mulder... let's get a team out here. Let somebody else do this.  ,4,8
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,4,8
"SCULLY: You're right, Mulder, it's not a match.  ",4,8
SCULLY: Tell us the name of that girl.  ,4,8
SCULLY: What year?  ,4,8
SCULLY: Drop the mind games.  ,4,8
"SCULLY: Oh, God...  ",4,8
SCULLY: Agent Mulder convinced the judge that it was an emergency situation.  ,4,8
"SCULLY: I had left Agent Mulder for the day. I suggested that he get some sleep. Sir, I have a clear idea of where he might have gone and I am sure that I can catch up with him.  ",4,8
SCULLY: Martha's Vineyard. And I would hope that you'd appreciate the uniqueness of this situation and it's effect on Agent Mulder.  ,4,8
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,4,8
SCULLY: He also took your badge and your phone.  ,4,8
SCULLY: Where?  ,4,8
SCULLY: What child?  ,4,8
"SCULLY: Mulder, what child?  ",4,8
SCULLY: You don't think he took Samantha?  ,4,8
"SCULLY: Well, where do you think he'd take this girl? Would he follow his M.O. and drive her out of state?  ",4,8
"SCULLY: Well, how much of a creature of habit is he? Do you think he'd want to take her someplace familiar?  ",4,8
"SCULLY: Well, he lived in Boston in the early '70s, right?  ",4,8
"SCULLY: Roche's old address in the area. Revere. Nine-eight-o-nine Alice Road, apartment number six...  ",4,8
SCULLY: I don't think he brought her here.  ,4,8
SCULLY: Come here.  ,4,8
"SCULLY: I got back some lab results. The dye analysis determined that the fabric of the last heart was manufactured between 1969 and 1974... but beyond that, there's nothing more they can tell us. Mulder, it's not Samantha... and whoever that little girl really is, we'll find her.  ",4,8
SCULLY: I don't know... but I do know you.  ,4,8
"SCULLY:  I, Dana Katherine Scully, swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me God.  (Gavel bangs, Scully sits down.)  I would like to read from a prepared statement.  ",4,9
"SCULLY: I left behind a career in medicine to become an FBI agent four years ago because I believed in this country.  Because I wanted to uphold its laws, to punish the guilty and to protect the innocent. I still believe in this country. But I believe that there are powerful men in the government who do not.  ",4,9
SCULLY:. . . men who have no respect for the law and who flout it with impunity.  ,4,9
SCULLY CONTINUES: I have come to the conclusion that it is no longer possible. . .  ,4,9
"SCULLY: With all due respect, Mr. Chairman, I would like to finish.  ",4,9
"SCULLY: Then why are we here, sir?  ",4,9
"SCULLY:  I respectfully decline to answer that question, sir.  ",4,9
SCULLY: Because I believe answering that question could endanger Agent Mulder's life.  ,4,9
SCULLY:  Then if I could please finish my statement. . . that it is no longer possible to carry out my duties as an FBI agent.  ,4,9
"SCULLY: No, sir. What I am saying is that there is a culture of lawlessness that has prevented me from doing my job. That the real target of this committee's investigation should be the men who are beyond prosecution and punishment. The men whose policies are behind the crimes that you are investigating.  ",4,9
SCULLY: What makes you so sure?  ,4,9
SCULLY: What makes you so sure that it's here -- that it's tonight?  ,4,9
"SCULLY: Well, so who do you think's leaking them, and why are they leaking them to you?  ",4,9
SCULLY: Driver's dead.  ,4,9
SCULLY: Mulder!  ,4,9
SCULLY:  How'd you get involved with these men?  ,4,9
"SCULLY: What do you want, Krycek?  ",4,9
SCULLY: You want this man brought to justice?  ,4,9
SCULLY: What flight is he on?  ,4,9
SCULLY: He still has to go through customs.  ,4,9
"SCULLY: Sir, federal agent. Don't be alarmed; I just need to speak with you.  ",4,9
SCULLY:  Stop! Stop right there! Sir!  (Doors close with Scully on the wrong side of them.  She looks to Mulder.)  Mulder!  ,4,9
"SCULLY: Mulder, look. (Points at pouch, which is lying on a pile of luggage, apparently dropped)  ",4,9
SCULLY:  Is this some kind of joke?  ,4,9
"SCULLY: Not its origin, no.  ",4,9
SCULLY: Are you saying. . .  ,4,9
"SCULLY: Does this rock contain fossilized remains, Dr. Sacks?  ",4,9
SCULLY: Got something?  ,4,9
SCULLY: Toxic?  ,4,9
"SCULLY: Mulder, that rock contains fossils of what is believed to be alien bacteria, and even that is under intense debate.  ",4,9
"SCULLY: What he's given us, Mulder, is a rock. Alex Krycek is a liar, and a murderer.  ",4,9
"SCULLY: What I'm worried about is you, Mulder and how far you'll go. And how far I can follow you.  ",4,9
SCULLY: What are you doing?  ,4,9
"SCULLY: Mulder, it's me. Listen to me: whatever's in that rock, it appears to be lethal.  ",4,9
"SCULLY: It's Dr. Sacks. He's. . . I don't know, Mulder. I've never seen this before. I don't know if he's dead or alive.  ",4,9
"SCULLY: Contamination is impossible unless there's a tear or a loss of pressurization. So whatever happened to him, it's unlikely it penetrated the suit.  ",4,9
"SCULLY: Look, there's a film over everything.  ",4,9
SCULLY: Oh my God! This man's alive!  ,4,9
"SCULLY: No, I think he is.  I think he's in some kind of coma state or some kind of somatic rigor.  ",4,9
"SCULLY: I don't know, I don't know, but we have to get him out of here.  ",4,9
SCULLY: Senator Sorenson wants to see us?  ,4,9
"SCULLY: Yes, but a summons for what??  ",4,9
SCULLY: It's hard to say.  ,4,9
"SCULLY: Agent Mulder is endeavoring to get his own answers, sir.  ",4,9
"SCULLY: Is that a rhetorical question, sir?  ",4,9
"SCULLY: We intend to file a complete report on this matter, sir, once we fully understand what it is that we're investigating.  ",4,9
"SCULLY: Agent Mulder is in the field, sir, seeking answers to the questions you are asking.  ",4,9
SCULLY: We havent been able to give him anything but fluids for over forty-eight hours. ,4,10
"SCULLY: Well, if he has been infected by some kind of organism we risk contamination...Are you seeing anything? ",4,10
SCULLY: What is it? ,4,10
SCULLY: It looks like a nest....some type of black vermiform organism attached to the pineal gland.  ,4,10
SCULLY: Sir...what are you... ,4,10
"SCULLY: Im sorry sir, my cell phone was turned off. ",4,10
"SCULLY: Yes Sir. Sir, if I might explain...the contents of that pouch...it contained some sort of a biohazardous organism that is, luckily, being contained in a contamination laboratory at NASA Goddard, where Ive been all day trying to determine its exact nature. ",4,10
"SCULLY: No sir, I dont. ",4,10
SCULLY: Who was it? ,4,10
"SCULLY: Yes sir, I am...Shes a well-know physician....and a...a virologist whos looked in on presidents. Shes also an authority on...on variola viruses. ",4,10
SCULLY:  Smallpox....Shes been a vocal proponent of eliminating the last remaining stores of the Smallpox virus....destroying the only remaining vials in facilities here in Atlanta and the former Soviet Union. ,4,10
SCULLY: Killed? ,4,10
"SCULLY: I Dana Katherine Scully swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help me so help me God. (a gavel falls and she takes a seat.) I would like to read from a prepared statement. ",4,10
"SCULLY: I left behind a career in medicine to become an FBI agent four years ago because I believed in this country. ( a messenger hands a note to Mr. Romine) because I wanted to uphold its laws, to punish the guilty and to protect the innocent.( Mr. Romine hands a reply to the messenger, who takes it to Senator Sorenson.) I still believe in this country, but I believe that there are powerful men in this government who do not . (Senator Sorenson reads the note.) ...men who have no respect for the law, and who flout it with impunity. ",4,10

"SCULLY: No, sir.

SCULLY: Ive got plenty to read. ,4,10
"SCULLY: Its not just Agent Mulder that I am protecting, sir. ",4,10
"SCULLY: We were called before this committee to answer questions about a murder- about an intercepted diplomatic pouch- a pouch that was to be delivered to a prominent doctor- a woman who is now dead, as is the man who was delivering said pouch- the contents of which have infected an exobiologist with a paralyzing toxin. Yet, what are we stuck on here? The whereabouts of Agent Mulder. ",4,10
SCULLY: Several of the men on this committee are lawyers. It is my experience that lawyers ask the wrong question only when they dont want the right answer. ,4,10
SCULLY: Or someone wants to make sure that he doesnt find out. ,4,10
"SCULLY: I know that, sir. And it is my natural inclination to believe that they are acting in the best interest of the truth...but I am not inclined to follow my own judgement in this case. ",4,10
"SCULLY: I cant answer that question, sir. ",4,10
SCULLY: Id be happy to answer you questions about the man carrying the diplomatic pouch... ,4,10
SCULLY: or about the biotoxin being transported within that pouch. ,4,10
"SCULLY: Yes, sir. If I may Id like to finish making my point. ",4,10
"SCULLY: That the death of Doctor Charne-Sayre, given her field of expertise, not only suggests that she knew something about the toxin, but also its origins, and that knowledge may be directly linked to the man in Assistant Director Skinners apartment building ( as she is talking, A.D. Skinner walks in. He does a double take when he sees Agent Mulder. He whispers something to Agent Scully.) ",4,10
"SCULLY: Yes, sir...uh...Assistant Director Skinner has just informed me that there has been an accident directly related... ",4,10
"SCULLY: A doctor, infected with the toxin, has died under suspicious circumstances involving a theft of evidence...of the contents of the diplomatic pouch... ",4,10
SCULLY: (pushes away from the desk and moves toward her partner) Mulder...(she hugs him). ,4,10
SCULLY: When did you get back here? ,4,10
"SCULLY: Mulder, Ive made several connections about this toxin- about what it might be... ",4,10
"SCULLY: Sir? I need your permission to book two airfares to Boca Raton, Florida. It shouldnt take more than twelve...fifteen hours...but in the even that it does, I need you to stall the committee tomorrow, for the purpose of... ",4,10
SCULLY: Dr. Bonita Charne-Sayre is a board member and a chief physician for a chain if elder-care convalescent hospitals across the country....guess what one of her patients died of in Boca Raton?  ,4,10
SCULLY: (brandishing creds) Agents Mulder and Scully. We need your permission to come onto the premises and speak with you or any of your patients. ,4,10
SCULLY: When was the last time these patients were checked. ,4,10
SCULLY: (checking a patients pulse) This man is dead. ,4,10
SCULLY: Who gave these patients their meds tonight? ,4,10
"SCULLY: Okay, I need you to call 911. Tell them you have an emergency quarantine of a biohazardous material. I need you to show us all of the entrances of the hospital. Weve got to seal this building immediately. (As the door closes, the camera moves in on the last bed. We see Vassily Peskow rise and sneak out).  ",4,10
SCULLY: I do not understand what it is you hope to learn here. ,4,10
SCULLY: But according to you that man is in Russia...possibly even dead. ,4,10
"SCULLY: This man Krycek, or Arntzen as you call him...How did he come into contact with you?...off the record. ",4,10
SCULLY: What did he say? ,4,10
SCULLY: You mean...used as bio-warfare? ,4,10
SCULLY: Lets go Mulder. ,4,10
SCULLY: Mulder! ,4,10
"SCULLY: What are you doing, Mulder? ",4,10
SCULLY: But whats in Canada? ,4,10
SCULLY: Back in the ground.  ,4,10
SCULLY:(goes to gate and climbs fence. The chopper takes off behind her. Peskow sees her and goes to hide. The sound of the closing door alerts Scully. ,4,10
SCULLY: (Goes to door marked Valve Room. She cannot open the door.) ,4,10
SCULLY: (glances at the oil blaze (caused by the explosion) and hurries off to find Mulder. She finds him lying on the ground near the fire.) Mulder! (she helps him to his feet and leads him away).  ,4,10
"SCULLY: Yes...Im ready here, sir. ",4,10
"SCULLY: Yes, Senator...evidence linking a number of deaths... a great number...to a biotoxin that was transported to US soil by a courier who was also killed. ",4,10
SCULLY: Yes. He has not been IDed. ,4,10
"SCULLY: Yes, sir. Alex Krycek...who is missing and, possibly , deceased. ",4,10
SCULLY: No sir. (The senators whisper among themselves) ,4,10
"SCULLY: Documents and interviews in support of a wide-ranging conspiracy to control a lethal bio-toxin that is, in fact, extra-terrestrial (as she speaks, Mulder comes to stand beside her, under the auspice of handing her a file)in origin. ",4,10
"SCULLY: No, sir. Not at all. ",4,10
"SCULLY: Mulder, this happened how long ago?  ",4,11
"SCULLY: Only the smell. Mulder, you brought me out here on the pretense of investigating an unexplained death. Can you tell me why were standing out here in the middle of a field looking at a dead goat?  ",4,11
SCULLY: A transient.  ,4,11
SCULLY: Purple rain?  ,4,11
"SCULLY: Mulder, this ""transient,"" as you call it, this bright flash in the sky - I assume you think it has some connection to -  ",4,11
"SCULLY: And the victim, Maria Dorantes, did she die in a similar fashion?  ",4,11
SCULLY: You assume? Nobodys examined the body?  ,4,11
"SCULLY: No La Migra, no La Migra.  ",4,11
"SCULLY: (showing badge) La FBI, no La Migra. (MULDER pushes her hand down to hide her badge.)  ",4,11
SCULLY: El Chupacabra?  ,4,11
"SCULLY: Who would that be, sir?  ",4,11
"SCULLY: (look to MULDER) Thank you, Mr. Buente. Youve been very helpful.  ",4,11
"SCULLY: (softly, only MULDER can hear) Maria ... Maria ... I just met a girl named Maria.  ",4,11
"SCULLY: It makes perfect sense, Mulder. Admit it. You fell for it. Your ""Fortean Event"" turned out to be nothing more than the oldest story in the world. Two men. One woman. Trouble.  ",4,11
"SCULLY: Mulder, what weve walked into here is a Mexican soap opera, and one for the local cops.  ",4,11
"SCULLY: Okay, I care, but what are we supposed to do about it?  ",4,11
SCULLY: While you do what?  ,4,11
SCULLY: Excuse me? Excuse me?  ,4,11
SCULLY: Im Agent Dana Scully with the FBI. (shows badge) Im investigating the death of a migrant worker.  ,4,11
SCULLY: Im sorry?  ,4,11
"SCULLY: Uh, a woman named Maria Dorantes. I need to determine a cause of death in order to close out an investigation.  ",4,11
"SCULLY: Well, Im a medical doctor. If you show me the body I can examine it myself.  ",4,11
SCULLY: (referring to the body being autopsied) I dont think hes going anywhere.  ,4,11
SCULLY: Did you find Eladio Buente?  ,4,11
SCULLY: Did he confess to the murder of Maria Dorantes?  ,4,11
SCULLY: Did he tell you what happened?  ,4,11
"SCULLY: He didnt kill her, Mulder. I examined the body of Maria Dorantes, and I believe that her cause of death was natural, albeit strange. She seems to have succumb to a massive fungal infection.  ",4,11
"SCULLY: Aspergillis, according to the coroner. Its a mold that's found in dead leaves, compost, even household dust.  ",4,11
SCULLY: Not normally. Its actually very common and quite harmless.  ,4,11
"SCULLY: Well, aspergillis can be lethal to people with immunodeficiencies like AIDS patients and ah, transplant recipients. And I found high levels of methyl bromide in her blood workup. Its a - a pesticide thats used for soil sterilization. Highly toxic. Now I think that her body was so ravaged by pesticides that a normally benign fungus may have compromised her whole immune system.  ",4,11
"SCULLY: Mulder, I know you dont want to hear this, but I think the aliens in this story are not the villains. Theyre the victims.  ",4,11
SCULLY: Look at that.  ,4,11
SCULLY: Mulder.  ,4,11
SCULLY: It appears this man died of systemic shock. Brought on by what appears to be another massive fungal infection  ,4,11
"SCULLY: No. It looks dissimilar. I dont know what this is. But its speed and its aggressiveness are frightening. The infections covered 90 percent of his body, Mulder, through both layers of skin.  ",4,11
SCULLY: No one knows where he ran?  ,4,11
SCULLY: Eladio Buente didnt kill this man. He didnt kill anybody.  ,4,11
"SCULLY: Mulder, this is the work of a pathogen of - of some kind of a highly virulent strain.  ",4,11
"SCULLY: Mulder, whatever you hope to learn by finding this man we have to first make a definitive classification of the fungi taken from the victims. I need to isolate it and I need to get a sample of it to a mycologist as quickly as possible.  ",4,11
SCULLY: Athletes foot?  ,4,11
"SCULLY: But our body has natural defenses against this kind of invasion. I mean, even in the absence of an immunoresponse a fungi like this one or like the aspergillis sample that I gave you, dont they need the right environment to multiply?  ",4,11
SCULLY: Whats this?  ,4,11
"SCULLY: So its not the fungi, but the enzyme that kills.  ",4,11
"SCULLY: Oh, my God.  ",4,11
SCULLY on cell phone to MULDER.)  ,4,11
"SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, its me.  ",4,11
"SCULLY: (on phone) Im at the state university bio department. Mulder, listen to me. I think youre right. I think Eladio Buente is responsible for those two deaths.  ",4,11
SCULLY: (on phone) By spreading an enzyme produced by what appears to be a new strain of conidial fungi.  ,4,11
SCULLY: (on phone) My guess is by touch.  ,4,11
"SCULLY: (on phone) He could be just a carrier, then  a kind of Typhoid Mary.  ",4,11
"SCULLY: (voice) Yes. Mulder, its extremely important that you not come into direct contact with this fungus. You must not inhale it, you must not touch it ...  ",4,11
SCULLY: (on phone) A bollide?  ,4,11
"SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, I think this is beside the point, right now.  ",4,11
"SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, let me work on the fungus, okay? What you need to do is to find the man who might be spreading it.  ",4,11
SCULLY: More goats.  ,4,11
SCULLY: Maybe you should check the back.  ,4,11
"SCULLY: There is no El Chupacabra, Gabrielle. Eladio is a very sick man. If he comes here, you must not let him in. If he comes to this door you must call the police. Do you understand?  ",4,11
SCULLY: For what?  ,4,11
SCULLY: Eladio Buente?  ,4,11
SCULLY: Drop your weapon!  ,4,11
SCULLY: Drop it!  ,4,11
SCULLY: Put it down! Now!  ,4,11
SCULLY: (seeing something) Mulder.  ,4,11
SCULLY: Gone where?  ,4,11
SCULLY: You gave him your money?  ,4,11
"SCULLY: You know, what she said about Eladio Buente, about his face ...  ",4,11
"SCULLY: Mulder, he could be anywhere right now. If - if he were to enter a metropolitan area with what hes carrying ...  ",4,11
SCULLY: If hes going to Mexico ...  ,4,11
SCULLY: Then where is he going?  ,4,11
SCULLY: I dont understand.  ,4,11
"SCULLY: Yes, sir.  ",4,11
"SCULLY: We cant exactly explain it ourselves, sir.  ",4,11
SCULLY: (voice) The Haz-mat team were able to contain the fungal infection within the migrant camp. No other casualties were reported. And we found no other traces of the accelerating enzyme.  ,4,11
SCULLY: They were nowhere to be found. Lozanos revolver turned up ten miles away near the car of a man known locally as El Barbera.  ,4,11
"SCULLY: Its not a fungus, sir. Actually, its an enzyme to which the brothers had an abnormal tolerance, and which came from what I believe to be an anti-enzyme gene.  ",4,11
"SCULLY: Well, sir, they, um...They have a way of being almost invisible.  ",4,11
"SCULLY: His name was Isaac Luria. He lived in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, home to a sect of Hasidic Jews who have lived there since the late 19th Century.  ",4,12
SCULLY: And now Isaac Luria. He was murdered two days ago in the market that he owned. Severely beaten and shot five times at point blank range. The police ruled out robbery because the only thing that was missing was a video tape from the surveillance camera. The police found it early this morning.  ,4,12
SCULLY: In the VCR of a 16 year old named Tony Oliver. That's him on the upper right.  ,4,12
"SCULLY: No, because he's dead. Apparently he was watching this tape when he was strangled to death.  ",4,12
SCULLY: Yeah. But with a new twist. The Brooklyn Homicide detectives contacted the FBI Civil Rights branch with an interesting set of fingerprints that they pulled off of the boy's body.  ,4,12
SCULLY: They belonged to Isaac Luria.  ,4,12
SCULLY: Some people might assume that. It's probably what someone would like us to think.  ,4,12
SCULLY: I think this is a crime of hatred like the crime that spawned it. A hatred that goes back 4000 years but masquerading as something else here. A callow attempt at murderous retribution disguised as spectral justice.  ,4,12
SCULLY: And not a very good one.  ,4,12
SCULLY: Somehow the killer got a hold of Isaac Luria's fingerprints and we have been asked to prove how.  ,4,12
"SCULLY: Excuse me, sir. We're with the FBI. We'd like to speak with Arial Luria.  ",4,12
SCULLY: Is she home?  ,4,12
SCULLY: We would like your permission to reopen Isaac's grave.  ,4,12
SCULLY: We're looking for evidence in the murder of this young man. His name is Tony Oliver.  ,4,12
SCULLY: He's one of three suspects in the murder of your husband. We believe it was an act of retaliation and that the other two suspects are targets.  ,4,12
"SCULLY: Because this is a homicide investigation, sir, and you are required by law to assist us.  ",4,12
"SCULLY: Sir, I'm afraid that even without your consent, we can get a court order to exhume Isaac's grave.  ",4,12
"SCULLY: I'm afraid he knows who killed Tony Oliver, Mulder, and he doesn't want us disturbing Isaac Luria's grave because he knows what we'll find.  ",4,12
SCULLY: Justice or revenge?  ,4,12
"SCULLY: Yes, but the right to free expression doesn't extend to murder.  ",4,12
"SCULLY: No, not directly, but these young men are and we have reason to believe that you know them. (She gives him two mug shots to look at.) Their names are Derrick Banks and Clinton Maguire.  ",4,12
"SCULLY: We work for the FBI, Sir.  ",4,12
SCULLY: You take a long look at these photos. It may be your last chance to save their lives.  ,4,12
"SCULLY: One of their accomplices, a man named Tony Oliver, was found murdered this morning.  ",4,12
SCULLY: You haven't heard the rumors?  ,4,12
SCULLY: That Luria is back from the dead? That he's risen from his grave?  ,4,12
"SCULLY: We're just relaying the evidence, sir. You can draw your own conclusions. But I'm sure you wouldn't want to be endangering these young men's lives.  ",4,12
SCULLY: Ligature marks on the victim's neck are consistent with the vigilante's MO. Forensics come up with anything?  ,4,12
SCULLY: I guess Clinton was here with Derek Banks.  ,4,12
SCULLY: Maybe they came to desecrate the corpse as retribution for Tony Oliver's death.  ,4,12
SCULLY: Afraid?  ,4,12
SCULLY: The body wasn't embalmed according to custom. Maybe it's postmortem lividity or some sort of tattooing. It's hard to tell with this stage of decomposition.  ,4,12
SCULLY: Is it ever buried with the dead?  ,4,12
"SCULLY: There may be a possibility that moisture leaked its way into the coffin, into the binding and pages of the book. If the ground water was contaminated with arsenic or arson gas could have created a combustible mixture.  ",4,12
SCULLY: A name?  ,4,12
SCULLY: Jacob Weiss.  ,4,12
SCULLY: There's been another murder. Another suspect in your husband's death has been found dead last night.  ,4,12
SCULLY: Yesterday he expressed strong feelings towards this latest victim.  ,4,12
SCULLY: And we found evidence placing him at the crime scene. This is escalating into something else Arial. Something that has to stop.  ,4,12
SCULLY: I'm sorry.  ,4,12
SCULLY: It's beautiful.  ,4,12
SCULLY: But your father survived.  ,4,12
"SCULLY: And through all this, he hid the ring?  ",4,12
SCULLY: Why?  ,4,12
"SCULLY: Arial, tell us where your father is.  ",4,12
SCULLY: What if you're wrong?  ,4,12
SCULLY: Do you see him?  ,4,12
SCULLY: I'm sorry. We don't mean any disrespect.  ,4,12
SCULLY: We're with the FBI. We're looking for Jacob Weiss.  ,4,12
SCULLY: Mulder...  ,4,12
SCULLY: Don't move! Federal agent!  ,4,12
"SCULLY: You okay, Mulder?  ",4,12
SCULLY: Put your hands in the air where I can see them. Turn around slowly.  ,4,12
"SCULLY: Mr. Weiss, we're placing you under arrest.  ",4,12
SCULLY: Come on. Let's go.  ,4,12
"SCULLY: We've arrested him, Arial, under suspicion of murder.  ",4,12
SCULLY: I think that's the direction it's going. Agent Mulder is in with him now.  ,4,12
"SCULLY: Arial, I think you'd better get him an attorney, he's refusing legal representation.  ",4,12
SCULLY: Okay. You ask Detective Barley down the hall. He'll give you a place to wait while your father is been processed.  ,4,12
SCULLY: Arial? (Arial turns to Scully.) I'm sorry.  ,4,12
"SCULLY: You want to see the background check I ran? He immigrated to Israel after World War II where he joined the Irgun, Jewish military underground. He was arrested in 1959 by the British for a bombing that killed 7 civilians. He's a terrorist, Mulder. A killer.  ",4,12
"SCULLY: What do you mean? He gave a confession, I just stood here and listened to him.  ",4,12
"SCULLY: Well, who? His daughter?  ",4,12
SCULLY: Who do you think it was?  ,4,12
SCULLY: Where are you going?  ,4,12
"SCULLY: Mulder, it's me. There's been another homicide.  ",4,12
SCULLY: Herb Bjunes. I'm on my way to the print shop right now.  ,4,12
"SCULLY: Well, he wasn't toiling in obscurity. This manifest lists hundreds of names, including our three murder victims.  ",4,12
"SCULLY: Yeah, I'll call the precinct and have him released.  ",4,12
"SCULLY: Oh, my God. It's Isaac Luria. He's still alive.  ",4,12
"SCULLY: No. That won't be necessary. (She hangs up.) Well, the coroner matched Luria's dental records.  ",4,12
SCULLY: It was definitely his corpse in the grave. This video tape... it must have been altered some how. Planted by whoever is staging this hoax.  ,4,12
"SCULLY: But if Luria is dead, Mulder...  ",4,12
"SCULLY: Well, who do you think it is? Some kind of a ghost?  ",4,12
SCULLY: A Golem?  ,4,12
"SCULLY: Mud! (She follows him.) Mulder, what are you talking about? And... for what purpose? Exacting revenge?  ",4,12
SCULLY: It's not locked.  ,4,12
SCULLY: Arial?  ,4,12
SCULLY: How do you know?  ,4,12
SCULLY: His pulse is thready.  ,4,12
SCULLY: If we get him to a hospital. (Mulder stands.) Where are you going?  ,4,12
SCULLY: Mulder...  ,4,12
SCULLY: Are you okay? I heard shots fired. (She helps him up. ) What happened?  ,4,12
SCULLY: What is she doing?  ,4,12
"SCULLY, alone, holding MULDERs nameplate.. MULER enters in casual clothes carrying a bag. He is in a hurry.)  ",4,13
SCULLY: Why dont I have a desk?  ,4,13
SCULLY: (wistfully) Back there.  ,4,13
SCULLY: So what is it you want me to keep an eye on?  ,4,13
SCULLY: And these reports are for sale?  ,4,13
SCULLY: Mmmhmm. Have you confirmed the identity of these individuals?  ,4,13
SCULLY: Im not going.  ,4,13
"SCULLY: Your contact, while interesting in the context of science fiction, was, at least in my memory, recounting a poorly veiled synopsis of an episode of Rocky and Bullwinkle.  ",4,13
"SCULLY: Rocky and Bullwinkle are looking for an upsidasium mine. Boris Badenov alters the road signs which causes them to walk onto a secret military base, where they are picked up by a car with no windows and no door locks, and there are silent explosions from a compound called ""Hushaboom.""  ",4,13
"SCULLY: ""Refusing an assignment?"" It makes it sound like youre my superior.  ",4,13
SCULLY: And its become mine.  ,4,13
"SCULLY: This isnt about you. Or maybe it is, indirectly. I dont know. I feel like Ive lost sight of myself, Mulder. Its hard to see, let alone find in the darkness of covert locations. I mean, I wish I could say that we were going in circles, but were not. Were going in an endless line - - two steps forwards and three steps back. While my own life is...standing still.  ",4,13
SCULLY: Where will you be?  ,4,13
"SCULLY: Wow. (At the tattoo, or the arms owner, were not sure.)  ",4,13
"SCULLY: The, uh, the color ... the red on the lips. Its extraordinary.  ",4,13
SCULLY: Mm-hmm. Thank you.  ,4,13
"SCULLY: What, you didnt get the tattoo you deserve?  ",4,13
"SCULLY: Never say never. Yeah, sometimes I wish I were that impulsive.  ",4,13
SCULLY: Im in town visiting my aunt in the neighborhood. How bout you.  ,4,13
"SCULLY: So it wasnt so much ""impulsive"" as it was ""hammered?""  ",4,13
SCULLY: No.  ,4,13
SCULLY: Id like that. But um.... Im ... um leaving tonight.  ,4,13
SCULLY: Hello?  ,4,13
SCULLY: Mulder. Whats wrong?  ,4,13
SCULLY: How did you know where I was?  ,4,13
SCULLY: Ive handed it over to the Philadelphia bureau.  ,4,13
"SCULLY: Mulder, there is no Xfile. Your contact is connected to the Vorofskoi Mir, extortion, credit fraud, cons, he is nothing but a swindler.  ",4,13
"SCULLY: What do you mean, how do I know? You assigned me the background check. I did as told, as always.  ",4,13
"SCULLY: What, you dont think Im capable?  ",4,13
"SCULLY: Its not just in this case, Mulder.  ",4,13
"SCULLY: It is over. Done. Pudovkin is out of our hands. Look Mulder, I have to go.  ",4,13
SCULLY: I have everything under control. I will talk to you later. (She hangs up)  ,4,13
"SCULLY: Uh, hi. Um, Ed Jerse, please.  ",4,13
"SCULLY: Its Dana. We met today. Um, my, uh, my flight was cancelled because of the storm and I was just wondering if I could take you up on dinner.  ",4,13
SCULLY: I could pick you up.  ,4,13
"SCULLY: Good. Well uh, Ill see you then.  ",4,13
SCULLY: Hi.  ,4,13
"SCULLY: Im, uh, early. The storms not so bad.  ",4,13
"SCULLY: Ed, I-I uh, I dont go out very much. I think the last time I went on a date was to see Glen Garry Glen Ross and the characters in the movie had a much better time. (Sees his sleeve) Ed, youre bleeding.  ",4,13
SCULLY: Im a doctor. Do you want me to take a look at it?  ,4,13
"SCULLY: Ed.... the, uh... the crummy bar you told me about. Take me there.  ",4,13
"SCULLY: So, what make this place a good place to go when youre feeling down?  ",4,13
"SCULLY: Yeah, but you cant tell whats going on in somebodys head just by looking at them. I mean, theyre probably thinking that were the ones that are screwed up. (Being very oral with her drink stirrer.)  ",4,13
"SCULLY: Who knows? I mean sometimes, I, uh... Ive always gone around in this, uh ... this circle. It usually starts when an authoritative or controlling figure comes into my life. And part of me likes it, needs it, wants the approval. But then at a certain point, along the way, I just, you know .... (makes a stop motion with her hand. JERSE looks at her questioningly) Okay, umm.... My father was a Navy Captain. I worshipped - - I worship - - the sea that he sailed on. And when I was 13 or so I went through this .... thing (hand gesture), where I would sneak out of my parents house and smoke my mothers cigarettes. And I did it because I knew that if he found out, he would kill me. And then... along the way, there are other ... fathers.  ",4,13
SCULLY: I want to see it.  ,4,13
SCULLY: (reaching for him) I want to see it.  ,4,13
SCULLY: Its okay.  ,4,13
"SCULLY and JERSE watch each other. Very sexual. Alcohol is swabbed, then the pattern of the snake eating its own tail is applied. SVO prepares the needle.)  ",4,13
"SCULLY: Yeah, um.... it feels weird. I, uh, I cant see it and..... but I feel different. Its like, um, I dont know how I feel about that.  ",4,13
"SCULLY: (seeing blood on JERSEs arm) Ed, youre bleeding again. Will you let me take a look at it? I am a doctor. (She pulls off his jacket and shirt)  ",4,13
"SCULLY: Ed, it looks burned.  ",4,13
"SCULLY: Uh, Im sorry. Hes not in. I dont know where he is.  ",4,13
SCULLY: No. Could I help you with something? Im with the Bureau.  ,4,13
"SCULLY: Such as? Look, I have a background in forensic medicine. I assure you that anything you divulge to me will be held in the strictest confidence.  ",4,13
SCULLY: May I? (Copies down substance information)  ,4,13
SCULLY: Okay.  ,4,13
"SCULLY: Yeah, Fox Mulder, please.  ",4,13
"SCULLY: Ed. Sit down. (Moves her coat. Her badge is on top) Some detectives were here. The woman in the apartment downstairs was reported missing. They found some blood in her apartment and I believe circumstantially, it may be yours.  ",4,13
"SCULLY: You need to tell that to the detectives. But what Im also afraid of - - and this concerns both of us - - is that an ergot alkaloid was found in the blood which is why I think it may have been yours. Now ergot is a parasite that lives off of rye and related grasses. Svo said that he used rye somehow in his ink. Now if this is true, we may be subject to hallucinogenic ergotism. Aural, visual hallucinations. Dangerous and unlikely behavior. We need to go to the hospital to be tested.  ",4,13
"SCULLY: We need to get help. Now, Im going to go into the other room and Im going to come back and we are going to go together. (Picks up her coat, her badge falls, but JERSE doesnt see it. She picks it up goes into the other room.)  ",4,13
"SCULLY: Okay, lets go. (doesnt see him at the desk)  ",4,13
"SCULLY: This isnt you, Ed.  ",4,13
SCULLY: Get control of yourself.  ,4,13
SCULLY: Take control!  ,4,13
"SCULLY: (Looking up at him) Not everything is about you, Mulder. This is my life.  ",4,13
"SCULLY: Well, whoever happened to get locked in here last night, I guess.  ",4,14
SCULLY: What about the morgue attendant?  ,4,14
"SCULLY: Mulder, what are we doing here?  ",4,14
"SCULLY: Yes. So? I mean, youre not suggesting that a headless body kicked his way out of a latched morgue freezer, are you? Are you? Because I think its obvious this is some kind of bizarre attempt at a cover-up.  ",4,14
"SCULLY: My guess would be body snatching for profit. Theres a shortage of - of teaching cadavers at medical schools. An unscrupulous medical supplier might pay top dollar, no questions asked.  ",4,14
SCULLY: Theres your perpetrator wearing a stolen uniform.  ,4,14
"SCULLY: Well, maybe he got spooked and was forced to abandon it.  ",4,14
SCULLY: Ill show you.  ,4,14
"SCULLY: All hospitals operate some form of medical waste processing. This unit disposes of surgical remains  amputations, excised tumors. Theyre ground up and heated with microwaves and the result is a uh, sterile soot thats used as road fill. (She is putting on a face shield and full arm gloves.)  ",4,14
"SCULLY: Well, that depends on how often they dispose of their waste. Hopefully, only once every few days. (Holds out hand. MULDER gives her flashlight. Opens door of unit. It is full of disgusting stuff.) Were in luck.  ",4,14
"SCULLY: (reaching in unit, squishing sounds) Mulder, I think Im going to need your help. Your arms are longer.  ",4,14
SCULLY: Leonard Betts.  ,4,14
SCULLY: Why did he take the time to dispose of the head?  ,4,14
"SCULLY: Well, we already know how he died. In an automobile accident. What more is there to know?  ",4,14
SCULLY: While you do what?  ,4,14
SCULLY: Lived.  ,4,14
SCULLY places BETTS head on a scale. It reads 10.9 pounds. She carries it to an autopsy table and picks up a tape recorder.)  ,4,14
"SCULLY: Case number 226897, Leonard Betts. As remains are incomplete all observations refer to a decapitated head. Weight:10.9 pounds. Remains show no signs of rigor mortis or fixed lividity. Nor do the corneas appear clouded which would seem inconsistent with the witnessed time of death now  (checks wall clock) 19 hours ago. Ill begin with the intermastoid incision and frontal craniotomy then make my examination of the brain.  ",4,14
"SCULLY: Oh, God!  ",4,14
SCULLY: Mmm.  ,4,14
"SCULLY: (on phone, voice) Its me. Um, Ive run into kind of a unique situation, here.  ",4,14
"SCULLY: (on phone) Uh, so far, not much. I uh, did a PET scan on Leonard Betts remains actually four times now, and each time the image has come out degraded uh, like its fogged somehow.  ",4,14
"SCULLY: (on phone) Well, this is cutting edge technology here, Mulder. The technicians say the machine is working perfectly. They also say the that only thing that could account for this kind of image distortion is some form of radiation, but I dont see how or-or where it could be emanating from.  ",4,14
"SCULLY: (on phone) Well, I  I havent exactly performed an examination yet.  ",4,14
"SCULLY: (on phone) Well. Because I, uh  I experienced an unusual degree of postmortem galvanic response.  ",4,14
"SCULLY: (on phone) It blinked at me. I mean, I - I know exactly what it is. Its residual electrical activity stored chemically in- in the dead cells.  ",4,14
"SCULLY: (on phone, sighs)  ",4,14
"SCULLY: (on phone) No, I am certainly not saying that at all.  ",4,14
SCULLY: (on phone) What do you mean?  ,4,14
SCULLY: (on phone) Leonard Betts?  ,4,14
SCULLY: (on phone) Without his head.  ,4,14
"SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, I dont even know how to respond to that.  ",4,14
SCULLY: This procedure is called biopolymerization. Its basically a high-tech mummification process. The remains are dipped in the epoxy and once its cured the specimen can be sliced for examination.  ,4,14
SCULLY: (NOT laughing) At any rate .. we should have some autopsy answers for you soon.  ,4,14
SCULLY: What?  ,4,14
"SCULLY: (looking at monitor) Oh, my God. His entire brain looks like one giant glioma.  ",4,14
"SCULLY: He was riddled with it  I mean every - every cell in this sample. Every cell, essentially, in his entire head and in his brain was  was all cancerous. Its completely pervasive.  ",4,14
SCULLY: What are you suggesting?  ,4,14
"SCULLY: Are you ever asked to defend this as a legitimate scientific process, Dr. Burks?  ",4,14
"SCULLY: (skeptical) ""Coronal discharge?""  ",4,14
"SCULLY: And the theoretical basis of holistic medicine, of acupuncture, but what is its application here?  ",4,14
SCULLY: I dont even know how to explain that photo or even what it proves.  ,4,14
SCULLY: Mulder   ,4,14
SCULLY: I dont know where youre going with this?  ,4,14
"SCULLY: Well, even if that were possible, hes been decapitated.  ",4,14
SCULLY: You think that Leonard Betts regrew his head?  ,4,14
"SCULLY: Salamanders ore one thing, but no mammal possesses that kind of regenerative power. I mean, there isnt a creature walking this earth that can regrow its head.  ",4,14
"SCULLY: Mulder, theyre worms.  ",4,14
"SCULLY: Well, unheard of or not, someone is going to great lengths to dispose of the evidence.  ",4,14
"SCULLY: (on phone) Scully  Yeah  Okay ..Great. Thanks. (hangs up) Well, apparently, Leonard Betts did have some secrets -- one of them being that he had an alter ego named Albert Tanner.  ",4,14
"SCULLY: I had Danny run the fingerprints. Two names came up. The second one was Albert Tanner. But, unlike Leonard Betts, Albert Tanner has a living relative  Elaine Tanner, his mother, who just happens to live here in Pittsburgh..  ",4,14
SCULLY: Elaine Tanner?  ,4,14
"SCULLY: Im Agent Scully. This is Agent Mulder, were with the FBI.  ",4,14
SCULLY: Is your son Albert Tanner? (ELAINE nods.) Wed like to ask you some questions. (They enter.)  ,4,14
"SCULLY: Mrs. Tanner, is this your son?  ",4,14
SCULLY: We know this man as Leonard Morris Betts. Are you familiar with that name?  ,4,14
"SCULLY: Mrs. Tanner, are you aware that your son has recently dies?  ",4,14
SCULLY: Would it be possible to get a copy of the death certificate or some form of verification?  ,4,14
SCULLY: (quietly) Yeah.  ,4,14
"SCULLY: Michelle Wilkes was murdered, but, uh, we wouldnt know that if the security guard hadnt witnessed it.  ",4,14
SCULLY: I found a spent autoinjector in the grass. She was given a lethal dose of potassium chloride. Its an electrolyte found naturally in the body and a coroner doesnt usually check for it.  ,4,14
"SCULLY: Well, the security guard did ID him as her attacker. He worked as an EMT, but his coworkers said his name was Truelove.  ",4,14
"SCULLY: Mulder, it just doesnt work that way.  ",4,14
"SCULLY: But, but language, evolution  I - its a process of steps, not leaps.  ",4,14
SCULLY: What youre describing is someone so radically evolved that you wouldnt even call him human.  ,4,14
"SCULLY: Oh, my God. Myeloid Sarcoma, Epithelial Carcinoma  these are all cancerous tumors. This is surgical waste thats been tagged for disposal. What do you think he wanted with them?  ",4,14
SCULLY: But that he needs it for survival? (MULDER nods) So youre saying that this is ?  ,4,14
SCULLY: Why do I think that Charles Darwin is rolling in his grave right now.  ,4,14
SCULLY: Betts mom.  ,4,14
SCULLY: Elaine Tanner? We have a warrant to search the premises.  ,4,14
"SCULLY: Mrs. Tanner, We know that your son is alive and that youre in contact with him. You need to tell us where we can find him. Last night, he murdered a woman in cold blood. By lying to protect him, you are considered an accessory to murder.  ",4,14
"SCULLY: What reasons, Mrs. Tanner?  ",4,14
SCULLY: Did you find something?  ,4,14
SCULLY: Receipt for a storage locker.  ,4,14
SCULLY: Lets check it out.  ,4,14
SCULLY: Mr. John Gilnitz. Death from massive blood loss due to what I can only describe as a skillful removal of his left lung.  ,4,14
SCULLY: Doing what?  ,4,14
SCULLY: How would he have known that?  ,4,14
"SCULLY: Well, what ever he was doing he is taking the secret to his grave.  ",4,14
"SCULLY: Mulder, Leonard Betts is dead. Of that I am absolutely certain. And he is not coming back.  ",4,14
SCULLY: I dont understand.  ,4,14
"SCULLY: Obviously, someone is lying. Maybe the first death was staged.  ",4,14
"SCULLY: Mulder, these men may be no more than monozygotic twins.  ",4,14
"SCULLY: Mulder, I dont know what youre getting at here. Regeneration of an entire body?. I dont know why Im standing here listening to this.  ",4,14
"SCULLY: If this man really exists, what make you think hed come back here?  ",4,14
SCULLY: Federal agents!  ,4,14
SCULLY: What are you doing here?  ,4,14
SCULLY: Stay here.  ,4,14
"SCULLY: Mulder, get the EMTs up here.  ",4,14
"SCULLY: She has an open wound, a surgical cut.  ",4,14
"SCULLY: Judging by the response time, he might still be here. (MULDER leaves.)  ",4,14
"SCULLY: Shes gonna be okay, Mulder. Shes not out of the woods, but I think we might be able to get where he went out of her.  ",4,14
SCULLY: Okay. (She gets in the ambulance and it leaves.)  ,4,14
"SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, its me. Weve got Mrs. Tanner going into the ER, but she took a downturn en route. They defibrillated her to try and get her to try and get her heart back, but theres no chance of getting anything cogent from her. Not tonight, anyway. What about on your end?  ",4,14
"SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, get over here right now.  ",4,14
SCULLY: (on phone) Get over here now.  ,4,14
SCULLY: Ahh!  ,4,14
SCULLY: Hes dead?  ,4,14
SCULLY: (quietly) Cancer?  ,4,14
SCULLY: (no answer)  ,4,14
SCULLY: I want to go home.  ,4,14
"SCULLY: I feel time like a heartbeat, the seconds pumping in my breast like a reckoning. The luminous mysteries that once seemed so distant and unreal, threatening clarity in the presence of a truth entertained not in youth, but only in it's passage. I feel these words as if their meaning were weight being lifted from me, knowing that you will read them and share my burden, as I have come to trust no other. That you should know my heart, look into it, finding there the memory and experience that belong to you, that are you, is a comfort to me now as I feel the tethers loose and the prospects darken for the continuance of a journey that began not so long ago, and which began again with a faith shakened and strengthened by your convictions, if not for which I might never have been so strong now. As I cross to face you and look at you incomplete, hoping that you will forgive me for not making the rest of the journey with you.  ",4,15
SCULLY: I guess that's the question. Actually I feel fine. (pause) ,4,15
SCULLY: It's what's called nasopharengeal mass. It's a small growth between the superior conchea and the sinoidal sinus. ,4,15
SCULLY: A tumor. You're the only one I've called. ,4,15
SCULLY: No. ,4,15
"SCULLY: The truth is that the type and placement of the tumor make it difficult, to the extreme. ",4,15
SCULLY: For all times I have said that to you I am as certain of this as you have ever been. I have cancer. It is a mass on the wall between my sinus and cerebrum. If it pushes into my brain statistically there is about zero chance of survival. ,4,15
SCULLY: Yes there are.  ,4,15
SCULLY: Thank you sir. I don't mean for this to be awkward and I would appreciate if we could keep this matter confidential. ,4,15
"SCULLY: No sir, actually I've asked my doctors to hold onto my medical records until Agent Mulder and I can exhaust a possible avenue of investigation. ",4,15
"SCULLY: Yes sir, but for my own reasons I'd like to like to pursue this through the justice department rather than a personal matter.  ",4,15
SCULLY: We're not here for the garage sale. We're looking for Betsy Higopian. No one's returning our messages. ,4,15
SCULLY: Someone's sending a fax or computer modem. ,4,15
SCULLY: And downloading data. ,4,15
SCULLY: Apartment 234 is listed under Kurt Crawford. (rings bell) ,4,15
"SCULLY: (yelling, aiming gun) Stop! Federal agent! Hold it! Put your hands where we can see them. Is your name Kurt Crawford? (Mulder knocks him down) ",4,15
SCULLY: What? (Scully dabs at blood on her nose) ,4,15
"SCULLY: I'm fine Mulder, quit staring at me I'm fine.  ",4,15
"SCULLY: Ya I'm just washing up. (cleaning blood off her nose, she leaves bathroom, sees K freed) ",4,15
SCULLY: You took his cuffs off. ,4,15
SCULLY: Then why did he run? ,4,15
SCULLY: You think he's credible? ,4,15
"SCULLY: Well, that will have to be cross-checked. ",4,15
"SCULLY: Why not? (pause while Mulder and Scully look at eachother, S walks toward K, arms crossed) ",4,15
SCULLY: How did they die? ,4,15
SCULLY: All of them? ,4,15
"SCULLY: What makes you think this is a conspiracy, that the government's involved? ",4,15
SCULLY: About what? ,4,15
SCULLY: What am I denying? ,4,15
SCULLY: Mulder it doesn't matter. ,4,15
SCULLY: (sharp) I don't know what happened to me. I have no clear recollection and I don't think these abductions are even abductions. ,4,15
SCULLY: No they are not. One woman isn't. There's Penny Northern. ,4,15
SCULLY: (angered) About what? What it feels like to be dying of cancer? What it's like to know that there's absolutely nothing you can do about it? ,4,15
SCULLY: I'm..I'm sorry did someone tell you I was coming here to see you? ,4,15
SCULLY: Then how did you know it was me? ,4,15
"SCULLY: I'm sorry I don't mean to be insensitive, but uh, I don't share those memories. ",4,15
SCULLY: I've come to ask you some questions. ,4,15
SCULLY: No. Who's Dr. Scanlon? ,4,15
SCULLY: His name's Scanlon? ,4,15
"SCULLY: Mulder, it's me. ",4,15
SCULLY: I'm at the hospital with Penny Northern. Where are you? ,4,15
SCULLY: Mulder that's.. ,4,15
SCULLY: Mulder I need you to come up here. ,4,15
SCULLY: I need you to bring the overnight bag from the trunk of the car and I need you to call my mother and ask her to bring up some things at the hospital. ,4,15
"SCULLY: Mulder, whatever you found or whatever you might find I think that we both know that right now the truth is in me, and that's where I need to pursue it, as soon as possible. ",4,15
"SCULLY: (waking) Ya hi, sorry sleeping. ",4,15
"SCULLY: Oh you know. I don, I don't feel sick at all. ",4,15
SCULLY: I know that the chemotherapy is going to make me sick. ,4,15
SCULLY: Hi mom. ,4,15
"SCULLY: This is uh, this is Dr. Scanlon. ",4,15
"SCULLY: Mom, I'm fine. I'm going to be fine, I'm just here for treatment ",4,15
"SCULLY: Thank you. (pause) Mom, I know what you're gonna say, but I don't have any experience being sick. I promise you, I feel fine, I feel..(sighs) ",4,15
SCULLY: I wanted to get all the answers first. ,4,15
"SCULLY: I have found some clarity, and maybe a way to fight back. ",4,15
SCULLY: You'll know mom. (Margaret Scully holds Scully) ,4,15
SCULLY: I know mom. ,4,15
"SCULLY: In med school I learned that cancer arrives in the body unannounced, a dark stranger who takes up residence, turning it's new home against itself. This is the evil of cancer, that is starts as an invader, but soon becomes one with the invaded, forcing you to destroy it, but only at the risk of destroying yourself. It is science's demon possession. My treatment, science has attempted exorcism. Mulder I hope that in these terms you might know it and know me, and accept this stranger that so many recognize but cannot ever completely cast out. And if the darkness should have swallowed me as you read this, you must never think there was the possibility of some secret intervention, something you might have done. And though we've traveled far together, this last distance must necessarily be traveled alone.  ",4,15
SCULLY: (sleepily) Where am I? ,4,15
SCULLY: I feel nauseous. ,4,15
SCULLY: I had a bad dream. Some..someone was doing something bad to me. You were there. I heard your voice. ,4,15
SCULLY: I'm sorry Penny. I ca..can't hear this right now. ,4,15
"SCULLY: I have not written to you in the last 24 hours because the treatment has weakened my spirit as well as my body. Mulder, it's difficult to describe to you the fear of facing and enemy which I can neither conquer nor escape. Penny Northern has taken a downturn. I now look at her with a respect that can only come from one who is about to walk the same dark path. Seeing her I can't help but see myself in a month or a year. I pray that I have her courage to face this journey. Mulder, I feel you close though I know you are now pursuing your own path. For that I am grateful, more than I could ever express. I need to know you're out there if I am ever to see through this.  ",4,15
"SCULLY: No, I don't think so Penny. ",4,15
SCULLY: I haven't. I won't (Mulder closes the door leaving Penny and Scully alone)  ,4,15
"SCULLY: I didn't want you to read that. I had decided to throw it out. I decided tonight that um..that I'm not going to let this thing beat me. I came into this hospital able to work, and that's how I'm leaving.(M nods) ",4,15
SCULLY: Yes. ,4,15
"SCULLY: That will have to be proven, if we find him. ",4,15
"SCULLY: Mulder I can't kid myself. People live with cancer. They carry on, and so will I. You know I've got things to finish, to prove to myself, to my family, but for my own reasons. (they smile, then hug) ",4,15
SCULLY: No sign of him in four.  ,4,16
SCULLY: Hold on. I think I have him in section four.  ,4,16
"SCULLY: Positive ID. He's heading toward you, three.  ",4,16
"SCULLY: Mulder, he saw me. He's heading towards the sound booth.  ",4,16
SCULLY: I'm closing on him.  ,4,16
"SCULLY: I lost him. You got him, three?  ",4,16
"SCULLY: He must be headed your way. You got him, Mulder?  ",4,16
"SCULLY: Was that for the benefit of the general, or have you been able to develop a real strategy?  ",4,16
SCULLY: I interviewed him and convinced him to take a polygraph test.  ,4,16
SCULLY: The nature of his claims would suggest a false positive. The tester admitted that the results are hightly interpretive.  ,4,16
SCULLY: The man who heads The Right Hand - Markham. Do you have a warrant for him?  ,4,16
SCULLY: Let Mulder and I serve it.  ,4,16
SCULLY: Agents Mulder and Scully with the FBI.  ,4,16
SCULLY: Mr. Markham?  ,4,16
SCULLY: The murder of General Peter MacDougal.  ,4,16
"SCULLY: No, but your group is. And Private First Class Gus Burkholder.  ",4,16
SCULLY: He's on the mailing list for The Right Hand.  ,4,16
"SCULLY: Well, we'd like to go over that list with you, sir.  ",4,16
"SCULLY: We already have a copy, if you'll just come with us.  ",4,16
"SCULLY: Sir, we have a warrant for your arrest if you don't cooperate. (she flashes the warrant) Under the new anti-terrorism law, we can and will hold you until we get the information we want.  ",4,16
"SCULLY: You can make this as easy or as hard as you wish, sir.  ",4,16
"SCULLY: Would you take a polygraph, Mr. Markham?  ",4,16
SCULLY: This guy's a one-man threat to national security. I bet he's got more weapons and ammo than most third-world armies.  ,4,16
SCULLY: Who's this?  ,4,16
"SCULLY: Mr. Markham, I'm sure that you're aware that in 1973 the Defense Department determined that there were no more POW's in Vietnam.  ",4,16
SCULLY: The government kidnapped a US prisoner of war?  ,4,16
SCULLY: I think I've heard enough.  ,4,16
"SCULLY: You don't believe him, do you?  ",4,16
SCULLY: A phantom POW left for dead comes back to avenge the injustices?  ,4,16
SCULLY: Or maybe not Denny Markham's war.  ,4,16
SCULLY: Or it's just a clever story being proffered as a cover-up for what is actually an elaborately orchestrated conspiracy.  ,4,16
SCULLY: Let Markham take the polygraph.  ,4,16
SCULLY: He won't.  ,4,16
SCULLY: (to Skinner) Is it true she made a positive ID from the photo?  ,4,16
"SCULLY: Markham may have staged this whole thing, finding somebody vulnerable like her to pass off his lies.  ",4,16
"SCULLY: To create a decoy, to divert our attention. It seems to be working.  ",4,16
SCULLY: Are you sure?  ,4,16
"SCULLY: Oh, your eye.  ",4,16
SCULLY: I think you just burst a capillary.  ,4,16
SCULLY: (to Mrs. Davenport) Hold a tissue there.  ,4,16
SCULLY: An eye exam? For what?  ,4,16
"SCULLY: Mulder, what she has is a simple sub-conjunctival hemorrhage. It's probably brought on by her emotional state.  ",4,16
SCULLY: What about you? What are you gonna do?  ,4,16
"SCULLY: Mulder, I'm at a Georgetown medical center.  ",4,16
"SCULLY: No, but the opthamologist discovered something. Something called a transient scotoma.  ",4,16
SCULLY: A floating blind spot.  ,4,16
"SCULLY: Well, any number of diseases can scar the retina. Diabetes, glaucoma, macular degeneration. In turn, they, they create a visual field deficit.  ",4,16
"SCULLY: Well, does she have any of those diseases?  ",4,16
SCULLY: It doesn't appear so.  ,4,16
"SCULLY: Well, not necessarily. Uh, the processes of the brain fill in and the visual cortex compensates conceptually.  ",4,16
"SCULLY: I asked the doctor that, and he laughed at me.  ",4,16
"SCULLY: Well, from my cursory exam, nothing about the general can explain your narrative.  ",4,16
"SCULLY: Not necessarily. He could have turned and been surprised. There's far too little forensic evidence yet to know, Mulder.  ",4,16
SCULLY: It's beyond my capabilities here to make that kind of analysis.  ,4,16
SCULLY: Sir?  ,4,16
"SCULLY: Neither of us has a clear explanation, sir.  ",4,16
"SCULLY: That is conjecture, sir.  ",4,16
SCULLY: Call it off.  ,4,16
SCULLY: General Bloch?  ,4,16
"SCULLY: We need you to get out of the car, sir, for your own safety.  ",4,16
SCULLY: Shooter! Get down!  ,4,16
"SCULLY: He was there! I saw him, I ... It was him, sir! It was the man in the photo!  ",4,16
"SCULLY: I saw him, sir. It was him.  ",4,16
SCULLY: He's doing all right. He's over there.  ,4,16
SCULLY: I'm not really sure.  ,4,16
"SCULLY: I told you. I'm not sure, Mulder.  ",4,16
SCULLY: How are you so convinced that General Bloch was his next target?  ,4,16
"SCULLY: Well, that doesn't prove that he was set up.  ",4,16
SCULLY: You're saying they wanted Skinner to fail?  ,4,16
"SCULLY: Mulder, the government is not about to sacrifice the lives of ranking military officers just to discredit us.  ",4,16
SCULLY: Secondary to what?  ,4,16
"SCULLY: I think Denny Markham's story is having its intended effect. I think you're buying into the lie, Mulder.  ",4,16
SCULLY: No sign of him in four.  ,4,16
SCULLY: Hold on. I think I have him in section four.  ,4,16
"SCULLY: Positive ID. He's heading toward you, three.  ",4,16
"SCULLY: Mulder, he saw me. He's heading towards the sound booth.  ",4,16
SCULLY: I'm closing on him.  ,4,16
"SCULLY: I lost him. You got him, three?  ",4,16
"SCULLY: He must be headed your way. You got him, Mulder?  ",4,16
SCULLY: Mulder ...  ,4,16
"SCULLY: Mulder, he's gone. He's gone.  ",4,16
SCULLY: He's with Skinner.  ,4,16
"SCULLY: What's going on here, Mulder?  ",4,16
SCULLY: When you're looking directly at him?  ,4,16
SCULLY: Mulder... you have never remembered my birthday in the four years I've known you.  ,4,17
SCULLY: Dog years? Thank you.  ,4,17
"SCULLY: Oh, you've got to be kidding me.  ",4,17
"SCULLY: What, an alien implant?  ",4,17
SCULLY: Hmmm... Apollo eleven.  ,4,17
"SCULLY: ""Commemorating Apollo Eleven and the mission to the moon, July 1969.""  ",4,17
"SCULLY: Oh, promise me this isn't leading to something really embarrassing.  ",4,17
SCULLY: Excuse me?  ,4,17
"SCULLY: Excuse me, who are you talking about?  ",4,17
SCULLY: You sure know how to make a girl feel special on her birthday.  ,4,17
SCULLY: You ever seen anything like this?  ,4,17
SCULLY: They think it hit the ground at over three-hundred miles an hour on an almost vertical descent. Meteorological data is being collected and analyzed and so far they are attributing the cause to... a weather phenomenon...  ,4,17
"SCULLY: Mulder, even if he was on this flight, looking at this, he'd be in a hundred pieces. I mean, they're going to be lucky if they can I.D. half the bodies they find here.  ",4,17
"SCULLY: Well, say we do find him. What's that going to prove?  ",4,17
SCULLY: Yeah.  ,4,17
SCULLY: Eight-oh-one.  ,4,17
"SCULLY: Uh, seven-fifty-two P.M.  ",4,17
SCULLY: It must be a mistake.  ,4,17
"SCULLY: Mulder, no one even reported the plane on radar. These guys are just going off of estimates until they can recover the data recorder.  ",4,17
SCULLY: What?  ,4,17
"SCULLY: Just a few minutes ago, you were absolutely certain he was on this flight.  ",4,17
SCULLY: We need an airlift to a burn unit as soon as possible! This man needs oxygen and a saline I.V.!  ,4,17
SCULLY: All of those are from Max?  ,4,17
"SCULLY: Sharon, we believe that there are things that you haven't told us. We need to know everything that you know.  ",4,17
"SCULLY: About Max. About where he's been, about where he's traveled, about exactly what it was he was carrying on that flight.  ",4,17
"SCULLY: No, but we found a passenger with severe burns, severe cellular damage. Burns that we wouldn't see unless the victim was exposed to a high level of radiation.  ",4,17
"SCULLY: We need to know what that was, Sharon. If you're withholding any information, there could be severe consequences.  ",4,17
SCULLY: Mulder...  ,4,17
"SCULLY: Paul Gidney. It's an alias that Max Fenig used in his letters when he went underground. He had many aliases, in fact, one of which he used to get a job at the Rocky Flats Environment Energy Site in Colorado where they handle and store Uranium two-three-five and weapons grade plutonium.  ",4,17
"SCULLY: Mulder, the burns on that passenger's face were deep tissue radiation burns. I don't know how else he might have gotten them.  ",4,17
"SCULLY: I don't know. I mean, he, he wrote hundreds, maybe even a thousand letters describing his abduction experiences, but beginning in January, he started making vague references to a theft. Now, it seems to me from reading it that he'd started to get the idea that he'd come onto something that was very dangerous.  ",4,17
"SCULLY: If he was carrying fissile plutonium, Mulder, and it became exposed in the cabin, it very conceivably could have caused the crash.  ",4,17
SCULLY: Mulder...  ,4,17
SCULLY: Mulder.  ,4,17
"SCULLY: Mulder, Max is returned. I found out a few minutes ago. They found his body a short way from the wreckage earlier today.  ",4,17
"SCULLY: Traveling under the name of Paul Gidney, seat thirteen-F, with the same burns as his seat mate.  ",4,17
SCULLY: Did you make a positive I.D. on Max Fenig?  ,4,17
"SCULLY: And the I.I.C. is making a statement to the press, saying that there was a complete systems malfunction on the plane.  ",4,17
"SCULLY: No, not yet, but they are taking a careful look at the emergency exit door, and while they cannot explain the radiation readings, they are not ready to attribute it as the direct cause.  ",4,17
"SCULLY: Mulder, why can't you just accept the facts?  ",4,17
SCULLY: What would you like them to report?  ,4,17
SCULLY: Are you accusing these men of covering evidence?  ,4,17
SCULLY: They were already out here?  ,4,17
SCULLY: Then what did you do?  ,4,17
SCULLY: We've been traveling a long way.  ,4,17
"SCULLY: Yeah, that must have come after our briefing.  ",4,17
SCULLY: Excuse me?  ,4,17
SCULLY: We'll take care of it.  ,4,17
SCULLY: I haven't a clue.  ,4,17
SCULLY: You think Max's sister was...  ,4,17
SCULLY: About what caused the crash?  ,4,17
SCULLY: From what?  ,4,17
SCULLY: Sounds like what you're describing is physically impossible.  ,4,17
SCULLY: Scully.  ,4,17
"SCULLY: Mulder, we've been up for over thirty-six hours, can't it wait...  ",4,17
SCULLY: I'm on my way.  ,4,17
"SCULLY: This is Louis Frish, Sergeant Frish. He's the air-traffic controller you heard on the recording that you played for us the other night.  ",4,17
SCULLY: Somebody would have spotted it.  ,4,17
SCULLY: Then somebody has to get him someplace safe.  ,4,17
SCULLY: Mulder.  ,4,17
SCULLY: Mulder...  ,4,17
SCULLY: In Great Sacandaga Lake?  ,4,17
SCULLY: By myself?  ,4,17
"SCULLY: You just let me know what's going on, Mulder.  ",4,17
SCULLY: I'm just going to get some things.  ,4,17
SCULLY: I'm going to ask for some kind of protective arrangement.  ,4,17
SCULLY: For what?  ,4,17
"SCULLY: You didn't bring that plane down, Louis.  ",4,17
SCULLY: It wasn't your fault.  ,4,17
"SCULLY: Look, I can't tell you how to feel, Louis, but I can tell you that I will do everything I can to make sure you tell your story to somebody who will do the right thing.  ",4,17
"SCULLY: Yeah, um... just tell her you're okay.  ",4,17
SCULLY: We're going to be met here by a federal marshall. You're probably going to end up sleeping in somebody's office.  ,4,17
"SCULLY: Agent Pendrell, how are you doing?  ",4,17
"SCULLY: I've been, uh, gone.  ",4,17
"SCULLY: No, you know what? That's okay, I'm with somebody.  ",4,17
"SCULLY: No, you know what? It's okay.  ",4,17
SCULLY: Get down!  ,4,17
"SCULLY: Get down, stay down!  ",4,18
SCULLY: I'll be right back.  ,4,18
SCULLY: Excuse me.  ,4,18
SCULLY: We've got paramedics on the way.  ,4,18
SCULLY: This man has a puncture wound to his right lung. He needs to be intubated immediately.  ,4,18
"SCULLY: When you talked to your girlfriend, what did you say?  ",4,18
SCULLY: Then there's someone inside.  ,4,18
SCULLY: I don't know.  ,4,18
"SCULLY: That's Sergeant Louis Frish, he was the intended target.  ",4,18
SCULLY: By whom?  ,4,18
SCULLY: Military arrest?  ,4,18
SCULLY: He has testimony that is damaging to the military. His life is in danger. He is not going anywhere.  ,4,18
SCULLY: For what?  ,4,18
"SCULLY: Sir, the military is responsible for the downing of that plane.  ",4,18
SCULLY: What is their story?  ,4,18
SCULLY: I'm fine.  ,4,18
SCULLY: Mulder.  ,4,18
SCULLY: I came to talk to you.  ,4,18
"SCULLY: According to the military, there was no misunderstanding.  ",4,18
"SCULLY: They had no choice, not in light of all the facts that have come out.  ",4,18
SCULLY: They allowed me to listen to their recordings.  ,4,18
"SCULLY: Yes, and that they were the only two aircraft on the radar screen.  ",4,18
"SCULLY: According to the Air Force, Sergeant Frish lied to save himself. When he found out that his, his fellow officer committed suicide, he came to us to blame the military. That's why they pursued him, to bring him to justice.  ",4,18
SCULLY: Yes.  ,4,18
"SCULLY: It was an F-Fifteen Eagle, according to an Air Force spokesman.  ",4,18
SCULLY: I don't know what to believe.  ,4,18
SCULLY: Those look like radiation burns. Where did you get that?  ,4,18
SCULLY: You found it?  ,4,18
SCULLY: What was it?  ,4,18
SCULLY: Except it can't be proven.  ,4,18
SCULLY: Because they haven't been able to find any physical evidence whatsoever that Flight five-forty-nine was involved in a collision.  ,4,18
"SCULLY: Mike Millar, the I.I.C.... the man running the investigation.  ",4,18
"SCULLY: I don't, except he seems to be the one man that truly wants to figure out what downed that plane and who came to me with information he had no reason to share.  ",4,18
"SCULLY: He found Sharon Graffia wandering in a daze at the crash site the night we left, after seeing lights over the area.  ",4,18
"SCULLY: That's another thing, Mulder. She's not Max Fenig's sister.  ",4,18
SCULLY: She's an unemployed aeronautical engineer who spent time in-and-out of mental institutions. That's where she met Max.  ,4,18
SCULLY: I don't know. All I know is that this plane seems to be killing people as it sits there on the ground.  ,4,18
SCULLY: Shot in an attempt on Sergeant Frish on Washington.  ,4,18
SCULLY: What are these people dying for? Is it for the truth or for the lies?  ,4,18
SCULLY: I remember being amazed at what some people will call home.  ,4,18
SCULLY: Only Max Fenig and you would appreciate living like this.  ,4,18
"SCULLY: Men with Spartan lives, simple in their creature comforts if only to allow for the complexity of their passions.  ",4,18
"SCULLY: What exactly are we looking for here, Mulder?  ",4,18
SCULLY: What makes you think he was coming to see you?  ,4,18
SCULLY: The military's public claim of fault for the collision and their covert actions to promote that claim have raised some suspicions.  ,4,18
SCULLY: That the story the military is now promoting is a convenient deflection and cover-up.  ,4,18
"SCULLY: Look, I, I had the same reaction to the story as you, but there is one logical area that has yet to be explained and that is that the, the seats and the door did show traces of, of radioactivity. Now, now you found nothing in the wreckage? No source of any emitter?  ",4,18
SCULLY: But not as a causal factor.  ,4,18
"SCULLY: Mulder, I don't know what else you expect him to do.  ",4,18
"SCULLY: Look, it is a good story, but it's, it's a house of cards built on a shaky foundation. We may never know what Max was carrying.  ",4,18
"SCULLY: Well, where do we even start?  ",4,18
"SCULLY: She's a disturbed person, Mulder. She wasn't even who she claimed to be.  ",4,18
SCULLY: In a mental institution.  ,4,18
SCULLY: Me too.  ,4,18
SCULLY: Sharon?  ,4,18
SCULLY: How are you feeling?  ,4,18
SCULLY: I know.  ,4,18
"SCULLY: Yes, it does. If you know something, if you know anything about what Max was doing, about what he was carrying on that plane... it could matter a lot.  ",4,18
SCULLY: To Max.  ,4,18
SCULLY: Why not?  ,4,18
"SCULLY: Max had those same blisters. You both were exposed to something, Sharon. What was it?  ",4,18
SCULLY: From whom?  ,4,18
SCULLY: What was it?  ,4,18
SCULLY: There was a third part. What happened to it?  ,4,18
"SCULLY: Mulder, it's me. Where are you?  ",4,18
SCULLY: How did you find it?  ,4,18
SCULLY: Mulder...  ,4,18
SCULLY: I don't know.  ,4,18
SCULLY: Mulder...  ,4,18
"SCULLY: Mulder, did you hear what I said?  ",4,18
"SCULLY: No, no, no, Mulder, listen to me. Do not handle it. Whatever it is...  ",4,18
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,4,18
"SCULLY: I think that what we've got here, Mulder, is a case of high-tech industrial espionage.  ",4,18
SCULLY: What flight number?  ,4,18
"SCULLY: I don't think that'll to be a problem, Mulder.  ",4,18
SCULLY: Scully.  ,4,18
"SCULLY: Mulder, where are you?  ",4,18
SCULLY: What?  ,4,18
"SCULLY: Mulder, did you get on that flight...  ",4,18
SCULLY: Right.  ,4,18
SCULLY: Yeah?  ,4,18
SCULLY: What? Mulder? Mulder?  ,4,18
SCULLY: Mulder. Where is he?  ,4,18
"SCULLY: What do you mean? You said you had him on this plane. You said you had what Max Fenig had, the stolen part.  ",4,18
SCULLY: I don't think you want to know the answer.  ,4,18
SCULLY: Max would have wanted it that way. You lost somebody very close to you.  ,4,18
SCULLY: I realized I didn't even know his first name.  ,4,18
"SCULLY: I actually was thinking about, uh...  ",4,18
"SCULLY: Cause of death was massive head trauma, pronounced on site. But according to the bus driver, it was no accident?  ",4,19
"SCULLY: Says here in the police report they'd been seen arguing earlier that evening, but Jason Nichols has refused to tell police about what.  ",4,19
"SCULLY: Between that and the bus driver's statement, why am I looking at this?  ",4,19
"SCULLY: That's his alibi, that some old man came and warned him that his colleague was gonna die?  ",4,19
"SCULLY: What was he wearing, a long black robe and carrying a scythe?  ",4,19
SCULLY: He was arrested?  ,4,19
SCULLY: Has anybody talked to him?  ,4,19
SCULLY: Has anybody talked to the campus security officer?  ,4,19
SCULLY: Why not?  ,4,19
SCULLY: Of what?  ,4,19
"SCULLY: You mean, with the autopsy?  ",4,19
"SCULLY: Hypothermic? Mulder, this man's an icicle. Did you see this? (points to the ear) His ear. It looks like something's been inserted in it.  ",4,19
"SCULLY: And now, his body temperature is 8 degrees.  ",4,19
SCULLY: I think we're gonna need some time ourselves.  ,4,19
"SCULLY: Well, my best guess would be that he's been exposed to some kind of chemical refrigerant, like liquid nitrogen, possibly even ingested it.  ",4,19
"SCULLY: I don't know what else to say, Mulder, except that what this doesn't do is add any credence whatsoever to the suspect's alibi that the old man was on the scene.  ",4,19
SCULLY: What if he can't?  ,4,19
SCULLY: Has Nichols said anything?  ,4,19
"SCULLY: Well, I think we may be filing a second murder charge against him.  ",4,19
"SCULLY: I found Nichols' right thumbprint on his uniform, and forensics also matched his with the prints they lifted off the interior of the patrol car. I think the old man in this story is gonna be Jason Nichols serving 25 to life in a federal prison.  ",4,19
SCULLY: What did he say?  ,4,19
SCULLY: Sounds like Jason Nichols has an accomplice.  ,4,19
"SCULLY: More than that, Mulder, it makes sense. Science is a high-stakes game. Jason Nichols is trying to eliminate his competitors and he's succeeding.  ",4,19
SCULLY: He's a cryobiologist. He freezes things for a living. How many people can do that?  ,4,19
"SCULLY: I want to show you something. (she hands him a folder with a specra analysis) This is what's called a nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. Dr. Yonechi had a spot of blood on the heel of his hand - a pin prick, something that might have been caused by a small gauge hypodermic needle. Now, I found the same thing on the security officer. This is the analysis.  ",4,19
"SCULLY: Well, no one at the lab would even hazard a guess, but we think it's some kind of unidentifiable chemical compound.  ",4,19
SCULLY: You'll have to ask Jason Nichols.  ,4,19
SCULLY: I'm Agent Scully. May I show you something?  ,4,19
"SCULLY: You recognize it? (Lisa doesn't respond) Lisa, you can tell us now or we can subpoena your testimony in court. Either way, we'll find out what you know about it.  ",4,19
SCULLY: A catalyst for what?  ,4,19
SCULLY: This compound ... has Jason actually tested it yet?  ,4,19
SCULLY: Is it possible that he could have synthesized the compound without you knowing about it?  ,4,19
SCULLY: Traces of the compound were detected in a man who was found dead last night - frozen solid.  ,4,19
"SCULLY: And a, uh, a Dr. Yonechi was also found frozen to death.  ",4,19
SCULLY: Just over two hours ago. Why is that relevant?  ,4,19
SCULLY: This isn't gonna work.  ,4,19
SCULLY: His body temperature was 8 degrees. The lowest reported body temperature ever survived by a human being was 70.  ,4,19
SCULLY: Don't try and talk right now. We've inserted a tube down your throat to help you breathe. Try not to fight the machine. Let it breathe for you.  ,4,19
SCULLY: Oh my God. He's on fire. He's having febrile siezures.  ,4,19
"SCULLY: Lisa, what happened? What, what could have happened to create such a violent cellular reaction?  ",4,19
"SCULLY: So raising his body temperature may have catalyzed an opposite reaction, heating him internally.  ",4,19
SCULLY: What did he say?  ,4,19
"SCULLY: But he just let you go? (she nods) Lisa, if you're leaving anything out, if you're hedging the truth, you could be held accountable if Jason committed a crime.  ",4,19
"SCULLY: But there are people who could have figured it out - Lucas Menand, Dr. Yonechi. These people are now dead.  ",4,19
"SCULLY: You know who this old man is, don't you?  ",4,19
"SCULLY: But Jason does. He has to, because this man is doing what Jason can't, he's protecting your secret.  ",4,19
"SCULLY: If he'd lie for you, what makes you think he wouldn't lie to you.  ",4,19
"SCULLY: Because it's not just her secret. It's Jason's secret, too, and the old man is protecting Jason.  ",4,19
SCULLY: (sighs) I suppose it is an unlikely choice as a murder weapon.  ,4,19
SCULLY: Are you sure this is the room?  ,4,19
SCULLY: I'm not sure if 'living' is a word I'd use on this place.  ,4,19
SCULLY: Yonechi's flight information was taken down on this pad.  ,4,19
SCULLY: When was this taken?  ,4,19
"SCULLY: It's a celebration, but of what?  ",4,19
"SCULLY: What? (she catches up to him at the hall elevator) Mulder, this is a photograph. It is a documented moment in time.  ",4,19
SCULLY: What?  ,4,19
"SCULLY: And if your sister is your aunt and your mother marries your uncle, you'd be your own grandpa.  ",4,19
"SCULLY: OK, so this photo that was never taken, when was it never taken.  ",4,19
"SCULLY: Mulder, the compound already exists. We have physical evidence.  ",4,19
SCULLY: Back from where?  ,4,19
SCULLY: You're seriously suggesting that this old man is back from the future?  ,4,19
SCULLY: So what you're saying here is the old man is ...  ,4,19
"SCULLY: I know what I wrote, Mulder. I also know that the laws of physics would permit the theoretical possibility of time travel, but the limits of human endurance would prevent such a trip from ever happening.  ",4,19
SCULLY: How?  ,4,19
SCULLY: Get her back in the tub. Now.  ,4,19
SCULLY: How hot's the reading now?  ,4,19
"SCULLY: We've resuscitated her, Mulder. Her body temperature is still high but it seems to have stabilized.  ",4,19
SCULLY: He's not here.  ,4,19
SCULLY: Where are you?  ,4,19
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,4,19
"SCULLY: Lisa? It's Dana Scully, can you hear me? (Lisa nods) You're going to be fine. We knew to keep you submerged in order to maintain your body temperature. After what happened to Dr. Yonechi, your theory about the compound's instability, well, you proved it yourself.  ",4,19
"SCULLY: The old man? (Lisa nods) Look, there's been some incongruous evidence. I've had difficulty explaining myself.  ",4,19
"SCULLY: Lisa, Jason's dead. There was a fire in the mainframe room. I'm sorry. (Scully gives her a comforting look) I'll see you at the hospital.  ",4,19
SCULLY: You find the second corpse?  ,4,19
SCULLY: We should put out an APB on the old man.  ,4,19
SCULLY: Even if it can never be proven?  ,4,19
SCULLY: I was 23 when I wrote that.  ,4,19
"SCULLY: No, seriously.  ",4,20
"SCULLY: Caudal appendages. Fetuses have them. Their coccyx enlargens to contain the spinal fluid and then it shrinks as the child develops. Occasionally, it doesn't. It's extremely rare, but it has been known to happen.  ",4,20
"SCULLY: So would I. No, Mulder I think you're right, I think that something about this definitely warrants investigation. Only not by us. I'd say that it's a job for the local health department.  ",4,20
"SCULLY: So uh, so what else about this interests you? Could it be uh...(looking at the sub-headline below the monkey baby: ""Did West Virginia Women Mate with Visitors from Space?"") ... visitors from space?  ",4,20
"SCULLY: Did you experience any unusual complications during your pregnancy, Amanda? Did you undergo any kind of fertility treatment?  ",4,20
SCULLY: Did he have a light saber?  ,4,20
"SCULLY: (interrupts Amanda) How many times have you seen Star Wars, Amanda?  ",4,20
SCULLY: Okay. Thank you.  ,4,20
SCULLY: Uh huh.  ,4,20
"SCULLY: (to phone) Okay. All right, I got it. Thank you. (she hangs up)  ",4,20
"SCULLY: I think you're right, Mulder. (she opens the door. Mulder stands in the hall, surprised by her response) Coming?  ",4,20
SCULLY: Good.  ,4,20
"SCULLY: (Points to the charts) You see here, these identical band trait matches all showing a small loss of a part of chromosome number eight? Each of these five children, born to five different women, all share the same father.  ",4,20
SCULLY: I should have thought of it sooner. This kind of appended birth defect is often passed on within a family.  ,4,20
SCULLY: Though he most likely had it surgically removed somewhere along the way.  ,4,20
"SCULLY: Birds and the bees and the monkey babies, Mulder.  ",4,20
"SCULLY: Well yeah, he's the only one in town.  ",4,20
SCULLY: So you're thinking that the doctor might have something to do with it.  ,4,20
"SCULLY: Settle down, nobody's going to be arrested.  ",4,20
SCULLY: Five out of five.  ,4,20
SCULLY: No. There's a few things we have to clear up first.  ,4,20
SCULLY: You're the father of five children Mr Van Blundht. Is that not news to you? (Eddie shrugs) Do you have any insight into how five women came to be inseminated with your sperm?  ,4,20
SCULLY: You had sex with these women? How is it that none of them have any recollection whatsoever of that happening?  ,4,20
"SCULLY: I do. (crosses her hands over her chest) On, uh, on behalf of all the women in the world, I seriously doubt this is anything to do with consensual sex. I think it involved some form of Rohypnol rape.  ",4,20
"SCULLY: It's been called the date rape drug. High doses of it cause a loosening of inhibitions, memory loss. Now if Van Blundht was somehow able to slip the drug to these women especially in conjunction with alcohol...  ",4,20
"SCULLY: Well he identified these women through his janitorial job at the medical park. He could have followed them anywhere, to a club, to a bar.  ",4,20
SCULLY: I think it's enough to keep him in custody while we check it out.  ,4,20
"SCULLY: Deputy, are you sure you don't remember what happened last night?  ",4,20
SCULLY: After hitting him over the head.  ,4,20
SCULLY: Van Blundht somehow physically transformed into his captor then walked out the door leaving no one the wiser?  ,4,20
"SCULLY: Mulder, why can't you just go for the simple answer? With that blow to the head the deputy might just as well have identified McGruff the crime dog as his attacker.  ",4,20
"SCULLY: Two men, roughly the same build, same coloring. The addition of a uniform goes a long way to explain how one person can mistake one man for another at 3 o'clock in the morning.  ",4,20
"SCULLY: But what are you saying, that that Van Blundht is an alien?  ",4,20
SCULLY: Hopefully myself.  ,4,20
"SCULLY: Looking like someone else, Mulder, and being someone else are completely different things.  ",4,20
"SCULLY: All right, then. Eleanor Roosevelt.  ",4,20
SCULLY: Why the hell not?  ,4,20
"SCULLY: Yes. He, uh, attacked a sheriff's deputy during his escape from custody.  ",4,20
SCULLY: Fortunately not.  ,4,20
"SCULLY: Sir, do you have any idea where your son might be?  ",4,20
SCULLY: No! (she looks at Mulder) No. No thank you.  ,4,20
"SCULLY: Uh no, actually I didn't.  ",4,20
"SCULLY: Eddie junior, not senior.  ",4,20
SCULLY: (from downstairs) What?  ,4,20
"SCULLY: It's difficult to say. The quicklime burned the tissue even as it preserved it, so what killed him is one of two things I haven't figured out yet.  ",4,20
SCULLY: That would be this. It's striated muscle tissue.  ,4,20
"SCULLY: In and of itself, nothing. Where I found it however -  ",4,20
"SCULLY: Everywhere. His entire body. As far as I can tell, this man has a thin stratum of voluntary muscle tissue underpinning the entire dermal layer of his skin. That's not normal. This man's body is quite a scientific specimen, and thankfully it's preserved and intact.  ",4,20
"SCULLY: In other words, there are six hundred and fifty four muscles in the human body, and this man essentially has six hundred and fifty five.  ",4,20
SCULLY: Possibly. It could be a linked gene birth defect.  ,4,20
"SCULLY: You got me, Mulder. Maybe none. It appears to be atrophied, although it may look that way as a result of the mummification.  ",4,20
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,4,20
SCULLY: Maybe. What are you suggesting?  ,4,20
"SCULLY: Isn't it much more likely, Mulder, that this man simply has an identical twin?  ",4,20
SCULLY: Where are you going?  ,4,20
SCULLY: ... and one single woman who didn't.  ,4,20
SCULLY: (on phone) Scully.  ,4,20
SCULLY: I'm on my way.  ,4,20
SCULLY: What's going on?  ,4,20
SCULLY: What the hell happened?  ,4,20
SCULLY: You got a lead on him?  ,4,20
SCULLY: So what? That's it for us?  ,4,20
SCULLY: Now you think there's no X-File here?  ,4,20
"SCULLY: Yes, sir. The subject, Edward Van Blundht senior, died of natural causes ... specifically heart disease and advanced age.  ",4,20
SCULLY: Most likely.  ,4,20
SCULLY: I entered him into the national sex offenders database. The West Virginia state police have a photo and a description and they will coordinate with local authorities. There should be an arrest soon.  ,4,20
"SCULLY: Well, seeing as how it's Friday, I was thinking I could get some work in on that monograph I'm writing for the penology review.  ",4,20
"SCULLY: ""Diminished Acetylcholine Production in Recidivist Offenders"".  ",4,20
SCULLY: Though actually I might bag that though.  ,4,20
"SCULLY: Yeah, I have to say, Mulder, the anomalous musculature in the corpse we found really has me intrigued. In fact, I think I'm gonna go to Quantico and have some tissue samples run. I'll see you Monday.  ",4,20
"SCULLY: (looking alarmed) Mulder, what's up?  ",4,20
SCULLY: No. No uh...come on in. (she sees that he's carrying a wine bottle) Who's that for?  ,4,20
SCULLY: Okay. Have a seat.  ,4,20
"SCULLY: More autopsy data. You know, everyone at the lab found Mr Van Blundht pretty fascinating. (he makes a sour expression) We discovered an additional anomaly related to the hair follicles in his scalp. I can't even begin to guess at the nature of it until we can run it through the transmission electron microscope.  ",4,20
"SCULLY: Yes, it is. So seriously Mulder, what's going on? You okay?  ",4,20
"SCULLY: What do you mean like...really talk? No, no we don't, Mulder.  ",4,20
"SCULLY: So there we are at two o'clock in the morning, me and my moire taffeta dress and Marcus in whatever the hell it was he was wearing - (he pounds the bottle to get the last drop out) thank you very much. It had a um... a kelly green cummerbund on it. Anyway, so, I know that Marcus is thinking that it's now or never, (he nods) and I'm thinking...  ",4,20
"SCULLY: I'm thinking ""what is that siren I hear getting louder?""  ",4,20
SCULLY: It wasn't the cops it was the fire department. My friend Sylvia and her idiot prom date ...  ,4,20
"SCULLY: ... had built this campfire that went totally out of control and so we all had to ride back on the um... what do you call it? The um, the pumper truck. Yeah. Marcus was the twelfth grade love of my life. (she laughs into her glass) I can't believe I'm telling you this!  ",4,20
"SCULLY: No, I'm seeing a whole new side of you, Mulder.  ",4,20
SCULLY: I like it.  ,4,20
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,4,20
SCULLY: Career wise? Miles off target.  ,4,20
SCULLY: Do you? (Eddie nods sadly)  ,4,20
"SCULLY: I don't imagine you need to be told this Mulder, but you're not a loser.  ",4,20
SCULLY: What am I looking at?  ,4,22
SCULLY: Yep.  ,4,22
SCULLY: (to Angie) This is where you saw the body?  ,4,22
SCULLY: And the blood from the victim was pooling where?  ,4,22
SCULLY: But both the body and the blood were gone when you returned?  ,4,22
SCULLY: Was the same woman that you saw caught up here in the machinery?  ,4,22
SCULLY: I would have thought that after three years you'd know exactly what that look was.  ,4,22
SCULLY: You're saying that what this man saw was the victim's ghost?  ,4,22
SCULLY: Which is just another name for a ghost.  ,4,22
SCULLY: A death omen?  ,4,22
SCULLY: Communicate what?  ,4,22
SCULLY: What?  ,4,22
"SCULLY: (holding up a TV Guide with Jay Leno's picture on the cover) And, does anybody recognize this man?  ",4,22
"SCULLY: Yeah, I found something here Mulder ... in these photos taken by the forensics team. The third victim, her left hand, that band of pale skin. It looks like she wore a ring on that hand.  ",4,22
SCULLY: Yeah. But she wasn't married.  ,4,22
"SCULLY: No, not at all.  ",4,22
"SCULLY: (shuffling through some other photos) And in all the other murders he repeated the same ritual, changing the ring on each of the victims.  ",4,22
"SCULLY: Well, there's something called ego dystonia. It's a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder where a person has the persistent and inescapable impulses to change things, to organize, to reorganize. But it's not ordinarily something that escalates to a murderous impulse.  ",4,22
SCULLY: You really think that the killer is a patient here?  ,4,22
SCULLY: Did he cop to making the call?  ,4,22
"SCULLY: Well ... when you're right, you're right.  ",4,22
"SCULLY: Harold Spuller suffers from pervasive developmental disorder, which is sometimes called atypical autism. He's spent his entire life in and out of facilities just like this one. He has been medicated, he has received shock therapy and, aside from his other disabilites, he has been diagnosed with severe ego dystonic obsessive-compulsive disorder ... which would explain the switching of the victims rings.  ",4,22
"SCULLY: You mean what made him snap? Why, I think his outburst clearly showed a frustrated impulse towards violence when he was put in a challenging situation.  ",4,22
"SCULLY: Mulder, the man is disturbed. You could see the pressure building in him from the moment the interview began.  ",4,22
SCULLY: Why are you now so unconvinced that Harold Spuller is the man we came here looking for?  ,4,22
"SCULLY: ""She is me.""  ",4,22
"SCULLY: Well, I think I have an idea about that if not an explanation. Howard Spuller is at this facility voluntarily, which means he can come and go as he pleases, to kill those women or to hold down a job or both.  ",4,22
SCULLY: Yeah. It's ok.  ,4,22
"SCULLY: Yeah, it's just, um, I'm fine. I just need to find a washroom.  ",4,22
SCULLY: (in a shaky voice) Yeah.  ,4,22
"SCULLY: That would rule out Harold Spuller as the killer, huh?  ",4,22
SCULLY: I don't imagine he'd be too hard to find.  ,4,22
SCULLY: Mulder ... I ...  ,4,22
"SCULLY: I think I'm going to let you take care of that. I, uh, I think I'm gonna get this checked out just, you know, just to be safe.  ",4,22
"SCULLY: No, no, I'm fine really. I've had the doctors keep a close watch and it's just, just precaution.  ",4,22
SCULLY: I'm fine.  ,4,22
SCULLY: This is different.  ,4,22
"SCULLY: Several months ago, I was diagnosed with a cancerous mass - a nasal pharyngeal tumor that can not be operated on and, uh, cannot be treated by conventional medicine.  ",4,22
SCULLY: I don't mean for this to sound too dire. My health has been good. I have been checked up on a weekly basis.  ,4,22
SCULLY: Yes. It's been important to me.  ,4,22
SCULLY: Why? Um ...Agent Mulder has been concerned. He's been supportive through this time.  ,4,22
SCULLY: (quickly) No. (pauses) I guess I never realized how much I rely on him before this ... his passion ... he's been a great source of strength that I've drawn on.  ,4,22
"SCULLY: I saw something. I, I don't know what to trust. If I saw it because of the stress, because the image had been suggested to me or if it was a suggestion of my own fears.  ",4,22
SCULLY: (exhales emotionally) Maybe.  ,4,22
SCULLY: I saw a woman who had recently been murdered. I saw her. It appeared as if she was trying to tell me something.  ,4,22
SCULLY: No.  ,4,22
SCULLY: No. What are you doing Mulder?  ,4,22
SCULLY: On what?  ,4,22
SCULLY: I'm fine.  ,4,22
"SCULLY: What's up, Mulder?  ",4,22
SCULLY: How?  ,4,22
SCULLY: That's what you need my medical opinion on?  ,4,22
SCULLY: I don't understand.  ,4,22
SCULLY: How do you know?  ,4,22
SCULLY: But you didn't see it yourself?  ,4,22
SCULLY: Why?  ,4,22
SCULLY: What's Harold Spuller's connection?  ,4,22
"SCULLY: Oh, wait a minute, so Harold knew the people that were killed?  ",4,22
"SCULLY: Even if what you're saying is true, Harold wasn't the only one who claims to have seen these apparitions.  ",4,22
SCULLY: Which is what?  ,4,22
SCULLY: Harold Spuller is dying too?  ,4,22
"SCULLY: Well, what if he isn't?  ",4,22
SCULLY: I'll meet you there.  ,4,22
SCULLY: Maybe you were wrong.  ,4,22
SCULLY: Then why would he do it?  ,4,22
SCULLY: Maybe. We won't know until we can examine him.  ,4,22
SCULLY: Is your name Chuck?  ,4,22
"SCULLY: Do you, uh, do you share this room with Harold?  ",4,22
SCULLY: Do you know where he is?  ,4,22
SCULLY: Why do you say that?  ,4,22
SCULLY: Who told you that?  ,4,22
SCULLY: Harold hasn't been taking his medication?  ,4,22
SCULLY: Who?  ,4,22
"SCULLY: Does anybody else know about these pictures, Chuck?  ",4,22
SCULLY: How are you feeling?  ,4,22
SCULLY: Understandable.  ,4,22
SCULLY: Will your family be a comfort?  ,4,22
SCULLY: No children?  ,4,22
"SCULLY: Nurse Innes, I'm afraid I'm gonna to have to ask you to step out into the hallway.  ",4,22
SCULLY: Stay where you are! Drop it! Let it go!  ,4,22
SCULLY: She's alive. Let's get a paramedic in here.  ,4,22
"SCULLY: Yeah, she attacked me. (Mulder starts to pick up the scalpel). You might want to bag that. I'm pretty sure it's the murder weapon.  ",4,22
SCULLY: She had been taking Harold's meds ... clonazepam and clozapine ... the unregulated effects of which are violence and unpredictable behaviour.  ,4,22
"SCULLY: Well, I went in to talk to Harold's roommate and he said that Harold thought that she'd been poisoning him. So I went in to confront her and she just went off.  ",4,22
"SCULLY: I don't know. I mean, maybe in some drug-addled way, she was trying to kill happiness, Harold's happiness, his love for those women, maybe trying to destroy something she thought she'd never have again.  ",4,22
SCULLY: I don't know. Have they found Harold?  ,4,22
SCULLY: What happened?  ,4,22
SCULLY: As a result of what?  ,4,22
"SCULLY: Well, Harold Spuller wasn't dying, Mulder. He, he was killed as a result of what that woman took away from him.  ",4,22
SCULLY: I saw something Mulder.  ,4,22
SCULLY: The fourth victim. I saw her in the bathroom before you came to tell me.  ,4,22
SCULLY: Because I didn't want to believe it. Because I don't want to believe it.  ,4,22
"SCULLY: No, I came down here because you asked me to.  ",4,22
"SCULLY: (defensively) What do you want me to say? That you're right, that, that I believe it even if I don't. I mean, is that what you want?  ",4,22
SCULLY: (softly) No.  ,4,22
SCULLY: The doctor said I was fine.  ,4,22
SCULLY: (whispers) I'm going home.  ,4,22
SCULLY: Hello? ,4,23
"SCULLY: Mulder, what time is it? ",4,23
SCULLY: It'S ALMOST 5:00 AM. Is something wrong? ,4,23
SCULLY: Where are you? ,4,23
SCULLY: Where? ,4,23
SCULLY: What are you doing there? ,4,23
"SCULLY: Are you hurt, Mulder? ",4,23
SCULLY: Mulder? Mulder? Mulder? ,4,23
SCULLY: You okay? ,4,23
SCULLY: You're in shock. Dry yourself off. I'll get you a blanket. Do you feel sick? Nauseous or dizzy? ,4,23
SCULLY: Were you here alone? ,4,23
SCULLY: Track my finger. Do you know what day it is? ,4,23
SCULLY: It's Sunday. What's the last thing that you remember? ,4,23
SCULLY: That was Friday. ,4,23
"SCULLY: I don't know, but you packed a bag. There's a change of clothes in there. Do you feel any pain? Did you receive a blow to your head? ",4,23
"SCULLY: Did you take anything, Mulder? ",4,23
SCULLY: Are you sure you didn't cut yourself? ,4,23
SCULLY: Where's your weapon? ,4,23
SCULLY: Two rounds have been fired. ,4,23
"SCULLY: Mulder, I need to get you to a hospital. You have to be examined by a neurologist. You have had a serious cerebral event. It could be a viral infection, or possibly the early stages of encephalitis. ",4,23
"SCULLY: Mulder, the first thing that you need to do, is to take care of yourself. Mulder, listen to me. We are going to figure this out, but first, we have to determine the cause. You cannot take something like this lightly. If this is an aneurysm, it could drop you in a second. ",4,23
SCULLY: No. ,4,23
SCULLY: You checked in alone around noon on Saturday. The manager's got no record of any phone calls made from the room. No visitors. ,4,23
SCULLY: You drove. He's got a license number of a car registered. Do you have those keys you found in your room? ,4,23
"SCULLY: There's blood on the steering wheel, Mulder. Car's registered under a David Cassandra. The address is right here in Providence. ",4,23
"SCULLY: That's what I'm gonna find out, Mulder, but first, I'm checking you out, because you have no business even walking around here. ",4,23
"SCULLY: You are taking a big risk, Mulder. I feel strongly about this. ",4,23
SCULLY: Is this David Cassandra's house? ,4,23
SCULLY: We're with the FBI. ,4,23
SCULLY: Possibly. Is Amy or David reachable in anyway? ,4,23
"SCULLY: Mulder, what's up? ",4,23
SCULLY: How? ,4,23
SCULLY: When? ,4,23
SCULLY: Do you know anything else about this house? ,4,23
SCULLY: Where's that? ,4,23
"SCULLY: If you've been here, Mulder I don't think it was any time recently. The place looks abandoned and completely overgrown. Mulder? Mulder?! Do you hear me? Mulder? Mulder?  ",4,23
"SCULLY: Mulder? Mulder, can you hear me? What happened? ",4,23
"SCULLY: You fell to your knees and you grabbed your head, like you were in terrible pain. You were completely non-responsive. Do you remember any of that? ",4,23
"SCULLY: What do you mean, what you saw? ",4,23
SCULLY: Do you remember anything else? ,4,23
SCULLY: Your heart is racing. ,4,23
"SCULLY: It was some kind of a seizure. Some kind of acute physiological disturbance. I couldn't tell if you lost consciousness but, it was definitely some kind of clonic event. Kind of an electrical storm in the brain. ",4,23
"SCULLY: That's what a specialist is going to have to tell you, Mulder. ",4,23
"SCULLY: Mulder, you are not really good. ",4,23
"SCULLY: What, in your childhood? ",4,23
SCULLY: I don't think anybody's lived here in a long time. ,4,23
SCULLY: Mulder. There's a gunshot wound to her heart. This must be Amy Cassandra. And her husband. ,4,23
SCULLY: They'd like to ask you some questions. I told them about your condition. You don't have to speak to them if you don't want to. ,4,23
"SCULLY: Mulder, I refuse to believe that you had any part in this. ",4,23
SCULLY: Agent Mulder's not going anywhere but to a hospital. ,4,23
"SCULLY: Mulder, I'd advise you not to say anything more--not until I take a look at those bodies and the forensics reports.  ",4,23
SCULLY: Did you see this? ,4,23
SCULLY: Do you mind? ,4,23
"SCULLY: I'm not sure. Do you have a magnifying glass? Thanks. I just want to make sure that in addition to the autopsy, you also do a craniotomy and a histological examination. ",4,23
"SCULLY: Yeah. I think it is, too, but what I'm more interested in right now is why they died.  ",4,23
SCULLY: Mulder. I'm going to get you out of here. ,4,23
SCULLY: Did you make a confession? ,4,23
"SCULLY: Detective Curtis, before you go through all that trouble, I need you to consider evidence that I think casts doubt on agent Mulder's involvement in this crime. ",4,23
SCULLY: Medical evidence. The toxicology report on Amy Cassandra indicates there was a rapid-acting anesthetic called Ketamine in her system. ,4,23
"SCULLY: Typically, but when ingested by a person, it can cause hallucinations. ",4,23
"SCULLY: So, I went down to the hospital to go over agent Mulder's medical charts and his blood work, and there are traces of the same drug in his system. ",4,23
"SCULLY: Probably injected--there was a bruise from an injection on Amy Cassandra's right hip. Now, I think if you were examined again--that we would find a corresponding puncture. ",4,23
"SCULLY: I don't know, but the presence of such a powerful drug could explain his memory loss or the blackouts. ",4,23
"SCULLY: Mulder, you have to help me out. There is nothing here that points directly to your guilt. I mean, unless somebody can show me with absolute certainty that you were holding the weapon ",4,23
SCULLY: You're jailing an innocent man. ,4,23
SCULLY: I'm a doctor. Somebody call the paramedics. He's dead. I need to speak with detective Curtis right now. ,4,23
SCULLY: Did this officer have a history of depression or mental illness? ,4,23
SCULLY: How do you mean? ,4,23
SCULLY: Do you see these photos? ,4,23
SCULLY: Does this mean anything to you? ,4,23
"SCULLY: Well, I think that it speaks to a pronounced mental illness. The compulsive and repetitive act of removing his own image from these photos leads me to believe that he not only believed these stories, but was traumatized by them. ",4,23
"SCULLY: Amy Cassandra. Both your officer and Amy Cassandra had identical puncture wounds at the top of the frontal lobe. Now, in her autopsy, Amy Cassandra's was a deep puncture through the cranium to the dura matter. ",4,23
"SCULLY: Yes. I think your officer knew of Amy Cassandra, and somehow his suicide is linked to her death, which leads me to believe that what we're dealing with here is not murder. It's something else. It's possibly even a suicide pact. ",4,23
SCULLY: Did he say about what? ,4,23
"SCULLY: I need to talk to him alone, if you don't mind. [to Mulder] I heard you didn't get much sleep. ",4,23
"SCULLY: I know that, and I think I've gathered enough proof and evidence of your innocence to get you out of here. ",4,23
"SCULLY: The forensics reports. The, uh, the shirt that you were wearing did have the victims' blood on it, but the blood-spatter pattern doesn't match the point-of-entry detail. In fact, detective Curtis and his team have been able to put together enough contradictory evidence to make a statement to the press saying that the Cassandras' death was as a result of a murder-suicide. ",4,23
SCULLY: Yes. ,4,23
"SCULLY: I think I have an idea about that, too. Amy Cassandra believed that she was an alien abductee. ",4,23
"SCULLY: Yes... apparently. According to an article I read on Amy, she had begun psychiatric treatment that was effectively recovering her past. The repetitive behavior exhibited in those paintings that we saw, was an expression of that treatment. ",4,23
"SCULLY: I can't say definitively, but judging from an almost identical suicide of a police officer who was receiving the same psychiatric care, I believe that the victims were suffering from something called Waxman-Geschwind syndrome, the symptoms of which are trance-like states, leading to vivid dreams about the past-- dreams that are more detailed than the conscious mind can recall. It's also called Dostoyevsky syndrome because the Russian novelist was suffering from it, too. ",4,23
"SCULLY: I can't explain that. I've arranged for your arraignment in one hour. I think that by then, detective Curtis and I will have gathered enough forensics data that you'll be released. ",4,23
SCULLY: This is the office of the psychologist that treated Amy Cassandra. Have you been here before? ,4,23
SCULLY: It's been here for a few days. ,4,23
SCULLY: Yes. We're investigating the deaths of Amy and David Cassandra. We understand that Amy was a patient of yours. ,4,23
SCULLY: Are you referring to her belief that she was an abductee? ,4,23
SCULLY: Did you also use this treatment on a police officer named Michael Fazekas? ,4,23
SCULLY: Mr. Fazekas shot himself in the head last night. ,4,23
SCULLY: Are you familiar with Waxman-Geschwind syndrome? ,4,23
SCULLY: Did you know Amy Cassandra suffered from it? ,4,23
SCULLY: I know what you do. ,4,23
"SCULLY: This man is lying about more than that. I think that he administered the Ketamine to Amy and to you. I think that you were treated by him, and I think that your blackouts--these seizures--are a result of that. ",4,23
"SCULLY: Why would you do that, Mulder? Why would you undergo something as crazy and dangerous as this? Mulder? Mulder! Mulder?  ",4,23
SCULLY: Mulder? ,4,23
"SCULLY: No, I am not going to take that for an answer. You do not belong at work. You need to be somewhere where you can be monitored. You are a danger to yourself, and a danger to me. Are you hearing me? ",4,23
"SCULLY: No, you're not driving. You're not doing anything until these symptoms go away. ",4,23
SCULLY: To go where? ,4,23
SCULLY: Okay... but I'm driving.  ,4,23
SCULLY: He's undergone a treatment. He believes it's helped him to remember things. ,4,23
SCULLY: Where's Mulder? ,4,23
SCULLY: Did you ask Dr. Goldstein? ,4,23
"SCULLY: Stop that car! Hey! Open the back door. What did you do to him? Look, I know he came back here. This is the only place he would have gone. Did you treat him? Damn it! Answer me! ",4,23
SCULLY: Where is he now? ,4,23
SCULLY: What was the last thing he said to you? ,4,23
SCULLY: Yeah. ,4,23
SCULLY: Is he in there? ,4,23
"SCULLY: All right... that man in there is armed. He is a federal officer in dire need of medical attention. He is not himself. Now, I'm going in there. If at any time he should flee that house, you need to tell your officers not to shoot.  ",4,23
SCULLY: Mulder? ,4,23
"SCULLY: Mulder, it's me. ",4,23
"SCULLY: Mulder, Put down the gun. ",4,23
"SCULLY: Please, Mulder...  ",4,23
"SCULLY: Are you going to shoot me, Mulder? Is that how much this means to you? Mulder, listen to me. You have been given a powerful hallucinogen. You don't know that these memories are yours. This is not the way to the truth, Mulder. You've got to trust me. ",4,23
SCULLY: Put down the gun. Let it go.  ,4,23
"SCULLY: Although cleared of any wrongdoing in the deaths of Amy and David Cassandra, agent Mulder still has no recollection of the events that led to their deaths. His seizures have subsided, with no evidence of permanent cerebral damage, but I'm concerned that this experience will have a lasting effect. Agent Mulder undertook this treatment hoping to lay claim to his past--that by retrieving memories lost to him, he might finally understand the path he's on, but if that knowledge remains elusive, and if it's only by knowing where he's been that he can hope to understand where he's going, then I fear agent Mulder may lose his course, and the truths he's seeking, from his childhood, will continue to evade him...driving him more dangerously forward in impossible pursuit.  ",4,23
SCULLY: Excuse me. (The people part and let her into the room)  ,4,24
SCULLY: Yeah. (She looks away and leaves the room.)  ,4,24
"SCULLY: Yes sir. Four years ago, Section Chief Blevins assigned me to a project you all know as the X Files. As I am a medical doctor with a background in hard science, my job was to provide an analytical prospective on the work of Special Agent Fox Mulder, who's investigations into the paranormal were fueled by a personal belief that his sister had been abducted by aliens when he was 12. I come here today, four years later, to report on the illegitimacy of Agent Mulder's work. That it is my scientific opinion that he became over the course of these years a victim. A victim of his own false hopes and of his beliefs in the biggest of lies.  ",4,24
"SCULLY: Yes Sir. Recent events have shed new light on the factual and physical evidence that would serve to prove the existence of extra terrestrial life, which was the foundation of Agent Mulder's consuming devotion to his work.  ",4,24
"SCULLY: Agent Mulder was recently contacted by man who's pursuit of this evidence seemed to coincide with his own. In his intense desire to believe, Agent Mulder was duped by this man. He was fooled by an act of scientific slight of hand calculated to perpetuate false truths, a larger lie. I am here today to expose this lie. To show the mechanism of deception that drew him and me into it. And to expose Agent Mulder's work for what it is.  ",4,24
SCULLY: So he toppled over me and down the stairs.  ,4,24
"SCULLY: Speaking of Bill, is he coming? (The maid opens the door and it's Bill.)  ",4,24
"SCULLY: Look at you, my big brother. (They hug)  ",4,24
"SCULLY: Yes, I did. Thanks for remembering this year.  ",4,24
"SCULLY: I'm fine. Let's get some dinner, huh?  ",4,24
"SCULLY: No, I'm sorry.  ",4,24
"SCULLY: Father McCue, I...  ",4,24
"SCULLY: Father McCue.. I appreciate my mother's concern, and yours. But I'm being treated for my cancer and taking every precaution.  ",4,24
"SCULLY: I haven't felt the need. I have strength and I...(the phone rings) I'm not going to come running back now. It's just not who I am. I'd be lying to myself, and to you.  ",4,24
SCULLY: Excuse me. (She gets up and takes the phone from Bill in the kitchen.) Hello? (Cut to Mulder at the office)  ,4,24
"SCULLY: No, is something the matter?  ",4,24
SCULLY: Contacted you about what?  ,4,24
SCULLY: What? (Bill's peeved)  ,4,24
SCULLY: When?  ,4,24
SCULLY: I'm on my way.  ,4,24
SCULLY: It's okay. Who's this... Arlinsky?  ,4,24
SCULLY: What am I coming to see?  ,4,24
SCULLY: Who found him?  ,4,24
SCULLY: You have the ice core samples here?  ,4,24
"SCULLY: I have no opinion, actually.  ",4,24
"SCULLY: This is your holy grail, Mulder. Not mine.  ",4,24
SCULLY: It just means proving to the world the existence of alien life is not my last dying wish.  ,4,24
"SCULLY: You already believe, Mulder. What difference would it make? I mean, what would proof change for you?  ",4,24
SCULLY: Only if it were disproven.  ,4,24
"SCULLY: I don't think about it, actually, and I don't think it can be proven.  ",4,24
"SCULLY: I can't go with you, Mulder.  ",4,24
"SCULLY: What I couldn't tell Agent Mulder, what I had only learned myself, was that the cancer which had been diagnosed in me several months earlier had metastasized. And the doctors told me, sort of a miracle, it would continue to aggressively invade my body, advancing faster each day toward the inevitable.  ",4,24
SCULLY: But not in old ice.  ,4,24
SCULLY: So it hasn't been tampered with?  ,4,24
SCULLY: Another agent asked me to.  ,4,24
"SCULLY: From a site in the Yukon Territory, why?  ",4,24
SCULLY: Plant or animal?  ,4,24
SCULLY: From what?  ,4,24
SCULLY: Is it capable of cell division?  ,4,24
SCULLY: Yes. Please.  ,4,24
"SCULLY: Excuse me, I'm looking for Dr. Vitagliano. (No response) Dr. Vitagliano, is he here?  ",4,24
"SCULLY: I'm supposed to meet him here. Actually, I a little late.  ",4,24
SCULLY: Bill. What are you doing here?  ,4,24
SCULLY: Thank you. Um. Where's Mom?  ,4,24
"SCULLY: I was ... ahhh ... knocked down a flight of stairs, but I'm okay, luckily.  ",4,24
SCULLY: I told Mom not to tell you.  ,4,24
SCULLY: Because it's very personal... Because I don't want sympathy.  ,4,24
"SCULLY: Oh, now come on, Bill...  ",4,24
SCULLY: What should I be doing?!  ,4,24
"SCULLY: Hey, look, just because I haven't bared my soul to you, or to Father McCue, or to God, it doesn't mean that I'm not responsible to what's important to me!  ",4,24
SCULLY: Thank you for coming. (She goes into another room)  ,4,24
SCULLY: Have you run it through the NCIC?  ,4,24
SCULLY: Try the federal data base. (She hits some keys. A match is found)  ,4,24
SCULLY: Where does he work? (She hits some more keys)  ,4,24
"SCULLY: STOP! FEDERAL AGENT! HOLD IT! (She runs after him. She runs around the bend and she doesn't see him. She raises her gun as she quickly looks between cars) MICHAEL KRITSCHGAU?! YOU ARE UNDER ARREST! Identify your location! (She hears a car start. She runs to it. Kritschgau is about to get away. She runs in front of the car. Gun raised. He screeches to a stop just in time, good thing, cuz she wasn't moving) GET OUT OF THE CAR! NOW! (He parks the car and raises his hands) MOVE! (He gets out of the car with his hands raised. She moves to the side to meet him)  ",4,24
SCULLY: Put your hands on the car. (She slams him onto the side of the car. His hands go to the roof. She starts frisking him)  ,4,24
SCULLY: I don't know what you're talking about.  ,4,24
"SCULLY: I had reached agent Mulder at a warehouse just outside of Washington in Sethburg, Virginia. They had managed the frozen corpse by helicopter down the side of the mountain and across the Canadian border in a refrigerated truck. After conducting a limited physical examination Agent Mulder was ready to believe that the body was that of an extraterrestrial biological entity. That he had finally found the proof which had eluded him. Which would confirm not only the existence of alien life but of his sister Samantha's abduction.  ",4,24
"SCULLY: He told me a story which detailed, point by point, the systematic way in which Agent Mulder had been deceived and used and how I as his partner I had been led down the same path. Losing a family member due to my allegiance and contracting a fatal disease which I was told was engineered by the men who responsible for Agent Mulder's deception.  ",4,24
SCULLY: I was only able to convince him to meet me so that he might hear the story the way I had.  ,4,24
SCULLY: Mulder... (Mulder almost trips over Arlinsky's body)  ,4,24
SCULLY: What?  ,4,24
SCULLY: So is this man. (She motions to the hot water bath. Mulder walks over and sees Babcock's body floating in the bloody water)  ,4,24
"SCULLY: Who did this, Mulder? Mulder? (He starts to angrily walk away)  ",4,24
"SCULLY: You said it yourself, Mulder. More tests needed to be run.  ",4,24
"SCULLY: Cellular material found in the ice core samples were a direct match for what this man Kritschgau described. Hybrid cells, chimeras within the matrix.  ",4,24
"SCULLY: Mulder, everything this man described. You can't just guess at these details. I'm sorry, but the facts here completely overwhelm any argument against them!  ",4,24
"SCULLY: Mulder, the only lie here is the one that you continue to believe.  ",4,24
SCULLY: Because it's easier to believe the lie. Isn't it?  ,4,24
SCULLY: He said that the men behind this hoax... behind these lies... gave me this disease to make you believe. (Mulder walks off and leaves her alone)  ,4,24
"SCULLY: Earlier this morning, I got a call from the police, asking me to come to Agent Mulder's apartment. The detective asked me ... he needed me to identify a body...  ",4,24
SCULLY: Agent Mulder died late last night from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.  ,4,24
SCULLY: Mulder? What are you doing? Why are you sitting in my bedroom in the dark?  ,5,2
"SCULLY: I'm not kidding, Mulder.  ",5,2
"SCULLY: What are you talking about, Mulder? What's going on? (Mulder stands from his chair in the corner and walks to the window, looks outside, shuts the blinds and turns on a lamp)  ",5,2
SCULLY: That's the dead man in your apartment?  ,5,2
"SCULLY: How did he die, Mulder?  ",5,2
SCULLY: Have you contacted anybody at the Bureau?  ,5,2
SCULLY: What are you talking about?  ,5,2
"SCULLY: That the hoax is connected to the military, just like Kritschgau said it was.  ",5,2
SCULLY: What?  ,5,2
SCULLY: This is a PBX operator at the Bureau.  ,5,2
SCULLY: Who would he be calling at the FBI?  ,5,2
"SCULLY: Mulder, how long has this been going on?  ",5,2
"SCULLY: That would mean that for 4 years we've been nothing more than pawns in a game, that it was a lie from the beginning. Mulder, these men... You give them your faith and you're supposed to trust them with your life. (He kneels down beside her)  ",5,2
"SCULLY: Mulder, we can't go to the Bureau making these accusations.  ",5,2
"SCULLY: Yes, sir. (She can't look at his face.)  ",5,2
SCULLY: I'm um.... I don't know what to say. They asked me to come down and identify the body.  ,5,2
SCULLY: I saw Mulder earlier this morning. He was wearing the same clothes. (Skinner takes a minute to size her up. He's not sure it's the truth.)  ,5,2
"SCULLY: Yes, sir. Four years.  ",5,2
"SCULLY: Yes, sir.  ",5,2
SCULLY: But that's not why I'm here.  ,5,2
"SCULLY: Yes, that's right.  ",5,2
SCULLY: He had information about the discovery of what Agent Mulder believed to be alien corpse. He said the body was part of a hoax.  ,5,2
"SCULLY: No... hard... evidence, no.  ",5,2
SCULLY: What knowledge?  ,5,2
SCULLY: Yes.  ,5,2
"SCULLY: Communications center, please. (She takes the phone log out of her pocket)  ",5,2
"SCULLY: Holly, this is Dana Scully.  ",5,2
"SCULLY: Holly, I need your help on something. I was hoping you could help me with some information.  ",5,2
"SCULLY: I have some calls placed to the Bureau on consecutive dates. On the sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth. They came into the pbx operator. The first was at 11:21, the next was at 11:14, 03:07, (Holly is typing in on her computer as Scully rattles them off.) 02:02, and 05:12. They would have all been transferred to the same extension.  ",5,2
SCULLY: Yes.  ,5,2
SCULLY: Whose?  ,5,2
SCULLY: Would Assistant Director Skinner be at that extension? (Holly types again)  ,5,2
SCULLY: (Scully is wounded.) Thank you.  ,5,2
SCULLY: Yes?  ,5,2
SCULLY: Yes.  ,5,2
SCULLY: Right. I...ah... I'm sorry I haven't gotten back to you.  ,5,2
SCULLY: Well then they were animal cells that you found.  ,5,2
SCULLY: What do you mean? You said there was mitotic cell division.  ,5,2
SCULLY: They began somatic development?  ,5,2
"SCULLY'S VOICE OVER: I had no way to reach Agent Mulder to tell him what I had discovered - an unidentified microscopic life form whose very existence held the possibility of revelation. Was this organism extracted from the ice which had entombed the alien corpse, the germ cell that might give proof of extraterrestrial life, or was it just the opposite? The scientifically engineered creation of a chimera, an unclassified biological product designed to set up a hoax manufactured to create a false set of beliefs that have long driven Agent Mulder? (Mulder reaches another door with a window and he sees women on tables with big stomachs and grid pattern lights shining on them) I now begin to realize that the answer to this question might exist within the life form itself, biological proof of this connection to the cancer invading my body to a virus living inside this organism to which I had been exposed during my abduction three years ago.  ",5,2
SCULLY: I need to do a Southern Blot to run a culture of what you showed me against my own DNA. You said that the unclassified cells you looked at under the EM were full of virus.  ,5,2
SCULLY: A match. And I need it before seven.  ,5,2
SCULLY: It's got to happen. Everything in my life depends on it. (Vitagliano leaves her with her blood. She look at the window on the door and sees Skinner looking at her and leaving. She gets up and goes after him)  ,5,2
SCULLY: What are you doing here?  ,5,2
"SCULLY: No, you weren't. You followed me here. Why are you following me? Is this more dirty work you're doing for the DOD?  ",5,2
SCULLY: I want an answer from you.  ,5,2
SCULLY: This isn't your job!  ,5,2
SCULLY: And what about yours?  ,5,2
"SCULLY: All lies lead to the truth, isn't that right?  ",5,2
"SCULLY: The truth. About the men behind what happened to me, about my abduction and the tests, about being exposed to something against my will, about being put on a table and having something implanted in me, and then having my memory stolen, only to have it return along with a disease that I was given.  ",5,2
SCULLY: Are you afraid of that?  ,5,2
"SCULLY: You're going to use that against me, aren't you. You're going to use me as I've been used all along. To preserve the lies.  ",5,2
SCULLY: Except proof.  ,5,2
"SCULLY: The cruelest ironies are those consecrated by the passage of time, chanced and occasioned by shocking discovery. I had joined Agent Mulder because of my background in the medical sciences. My assignment was to question his work, to debunk his investigations, and rein him back into the FBI mainstream. Now, as fate would have it, I am calling on these very same skills to prove that he has been the target of a scheme orchestrated by someone close to us in the FBI. Someone we have trusted above all others. Involved in a highly organized plot to keep a dangerous secret from the light of day. (We see Mulder going through Level 4, in a hallway, lower ceilings, air ducts and pipes exposed) I could only guess at what Agent Mulder may have uncovered on his own, what he may have found to confirm or deny what he has long held to be a conspiracy to control the public inquiry into government's knowledge and contact with an alien race or races. (Back to Scully) If he had hoped, as I do, to learn the identity of those who sought to destroy us, I had, with the discovery of this unidentified microorganism, what could amount to forensic evidence. Hard and undeniable genetic evidence of the connection between the conspirators and the cancer which has now metastasized in my bloodstream. (Mulder gets to the door Cancerman used in the Pilot! The vast room of shelves of files and evidence in the Pentagon. He uses the code card. It opens. He goes inside. He walks through the rows of shelves) I have few short hours to conduct these tests before I must appear before an FBI panel to explain myself. And as I am ready to lie to them about Agent Mulder, I am also ready to confront them with proof. (Back to Scully) Proof extracted from this tiny organism that could blow open a conspiracy of global consequence. (Mulder's turn for voice over as he walks through the room)  ",5,2
"SCULLY'S VOICE OVER: If my work with Agent Mulder has tested the foundation of my beliefs, science has been and continues to be my guiding light. Now I'm again relying on its familiar and systematic methods to arrive at a truth, a fact that might explain the fate that has befallen me. An investigation that began without, now turning within. Taking cellular material from the unidentified life form and isolating a virus contained within it, then matching the DNA from this virus with that which I believe has caused my cancer. I hope a picture will develop. A picture that might confirm my darkest suspicions about the source of this disease invading my body in hope of obtaining evidence that its cause is not without blame, even though its cure remains unknown. If science serves me to these ends... it is not lost on me that the tool which I've come to depend on absolutely cannot save or protect me... but only bring into focus the darkness that lies ahead.  ",5,2
SCULLY: There it is.  ,5,2
SCULLY: My DNA hybridized with the viral DNA from the cell culture.  ,5,2
SCULLY: I know.  ,5,2
SCULLY: I believe that I was exposed to this material and that it is responsible for giving me a serious illness.  ,5,2
SCULLY: One which cannot be cured.  ,5,2
"SCULLY: Yes sir. Four years ago, Section Chief Blevins assigned me to a project you all know as the X-Files. (A flash of Scully sitting in a chair in Blevins office in the Pilot) As I am a medical doctor with a background in hard science, my job was to provide an analytical perspective (Scully entering the X Files office for the first time in the Pilot) on the work of Agent Fox Mulder, whose investigations into the paranormal (Flash of Mulder looking for the file in Paper Clip, the Strughold Mining Company) were fueled by a personal belief that his sister (A flash of Samantha's file in Paper Clip) had been abducted by aliens when he was twelve. I come here today, four years later, to report on the illegitimacy of Agent Mulder's work. That it is my scientific opinion that he became through the course of these years, a victim. A victim of his own false hopes, and of his belief in the biggest of lies.  ",5,2
"SCULLY: Yes, sir. (Mulder comes out of the door he ducked through earlier to get away from the security guys) He told me a story which detailed point by point the systematic way in which Agent Mulder had been deceived and used. (Mulder walks quickly down the hallway) And how I as his partner had been led down the same path, losing a family member due to my allegiance (Mulder reaches the code card slide thing) and contracting a fatal disease, which I was being told was engineered by the men who were responsible for Agent Mulder's deception. (Mulder slides the card through and waits)  ",5,2
"SCULLY: What I couldn't tell Agent Mulder what I had only just learned myself, was that the cancer which had been diagnosed in me several months earlier had metastasized. And the doctors told me short of a miracle it would continue to aggressively invade my body, advancing faster each day towards the inevitable. (Mulder looks down the hall. Two security men enter and walk down the long hallway toward him. He tries the card again. It refuses it again. Mulder winces and looks at the two coming closer. He tries it again. No good. The two are closer. Mulder slides the card through again, fast. He waits. It works. He goes out the door and away. Cancerman is standing by the door in the security booth. Mulder didn't see him)  ",5,2
"SCULLY: Early this morning, I got a call from the police... asking me to come to Agent Mulder's apartment. The detective asked me... He needed me to identify a body.  ",5,2
"SCULLY: Agent Mulder died late last night from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. (There, she's said it. She sniffs. The door opens. She turns to see Skinner enter with the autopsy results)  ",5,2
"SCULLY: Yes, sir.  ",5,2
"SCULLY: Yes, sir. But I have proof against the men behind this... of the lies that I believed. What I have here is proof undeniable... that the men who gave me this disease were also behind the hoax. A plot designed to lead to Agent Mulder's demise and to my own. Planned and executed by someone in this room.. (She opens her file on the table and it's the result of the Blot) What I have here is scientific evidence-- (Blood drips on the result. She looks at Blevins. She has a bloody nose. She feels woozy. She falls back into the chair, helped by Skinner. She looks at Skinner) You...  ",5,2
SCULLY'S ROOM  ,5,3
"SCULLY: Mulder, what are you doing here?  ",5,3
"SCULLY: Mulder, somebody's going to see you here.  ",5,3
SCULLY: What happened?  ,5,3
"SCULLY: Mulder, don't try and protect me. I need to know.  ",5,3
SCULLY: Did you find out who in the FBI is involved?  ,5,3
SCULLY: Yes it does.  ,5,3
"SCULLY: Mulder, Skinner has evidence against you. He knows that you killed that man they found in your apartment.  ",5,3
"SCULLY: Mulder, Skinner's dirty. He's not your friend. I'm almost certain that he's the man inside on this.  ",5,3
"SCULLY: If you testify, he will use it to ruin you. (He puts his hand to her face)  ",5,3
"SCULLY: He's been in a position to know everything from the beginning, everything that we've done over the past four years.  ",5,3
"SCULLY: Well then, you have to lay it on me. You have to tell them that I was the one who killed that man.  ",5,3
"SCULLY: Yes, you can. Mulder, if I can save you, let me. Let me at least give some meaning to what's happened to me.  ",5,3
"SCULLY: Hi, Mom.  ",5,3
SCULLY'S ROOM  ,5,3
SCULLY: I think ... that everybody here has their heart in the right place. But I need it to be my decision.  ,5,3
"SCULLY: I know you're only looking out for me, Bill. But I don't think you have all the facts.  ",5,3
SCULLY: Yes. I am.  ,5,3
SCULLY: I'd like to try this.  ,5,3
SCULLY: Um... either it's my head or I'm a long way from med school but I can't remember what you're injecting me with.  ,5,3
SCULLY: You're not holding your breath are you?  ,5,3
"SCULLY: Have you ever witnessed a miracle, Dr. Zuckerman?  ",5,3
SCULLY: Isn't that a miracle?  ,5,3
SCULLY: Thank you.  ,5,3
SCULLY'S ROOM  ,5,3
SCULLY: I'm so sorry... I fight and I fight and I fight... But I'm so stupid.  ,5,3
"SCULLY: I've come so far in my life on simple faith, and now when I need it the most I just push it away. I mean, why ... why do I wear this? (Scully holds up the cross necklace) Why do I wear this, Mom? I put something that I don't even know or understand under the skin of my neck. I will subject myself to these crazy treatments, and I keep telling myself that I'm doing everything I can, but it's a lie!  ",5,3
SCULLY: But I have. In a way. And when you asked Father McCue to dinner to administer to my faith... I just closed off to him.  ,5,3
"SCULLY: I'm not getting better, Mom.  ",5,3
SCULLY: Yeah. The PET scan shows no improvement.  ,5,3
SCULLY'S ROOM - NIGHT  ,5,3
SCULLY: What are you doing here? You have a hearing.  ,5,3
"SCULLY: Came by for what? Mulder, what is it?  ",5,3
SCULLY: A deal with who?  ,5,3
SCULLY: What happened this morning?  ,5,3
SCULLY: Are you going to name him?  ,5,3
SCULLY: Then they'll prosecute you.  ,5,3
"SCULLY: Mulder, even with the ballistics evidence, I can still be the shoot...  ",5,3
SCULLY: Then why'd you come here if you'd already made up your mind?  ,5,3
SCULLY: You'll be in my prayers. (Mulder leans in to her ear)  ,5,3
SCULLY: Ummm.... I think I went to a constructive problem solving course when I first joined the Bureau.  ,5,4
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,5,4
SCULLY: Mulder? Weve got this conference. Theyre waiting.  ,5,4
SCULLY: You want me to tell them that youre not going to make it to this years teamwork seminar.  ,5,4
SCULLY: Since you wont be making it to the conference ....  ,5,4
"SCULLY: However, I must remind you this goes against the Bureaus policy of male and female agents consorting in the same motel room while on assignment. (opens wine)  ",5,4
"SCULLY: Well, what does that have to do with anything?  ",5,4
SCULLY: I thought this was just a ploy to get out of the conference.  ,5,4
"SCULLY: Mulder, were in Western Florida. The closest thing to primitive down here is living in a beachfront retirement condo.  ",5,4
SCULLY: Where are you going?  ,5,4
"SCULLY: You know, Mulder, sometimes I think some work on your communication skills wouldnt be such a bad idea.  ",5,4
SCULLY: Hows the boy?  ,5,4
SCULLY: I think I might have some insight into this invisible creature he said was chasing him. (Shows MULDER the video tape.)  ,5,4
SCULLY: Right.  ,5,4
SCULLY: (Rolls eyes)  ,5,4
SCULLY: Mm hmm.  ,5,4
SCULLY: And?  ,5,4
SCULLY: Where?  ,5,4
SCULLY: That could have been brought in by the dog.  ,5,4
SCULLY: Wait a minute. I thought you said it wasnt human.  ,5,4
SCULLY: (pause) Youre putting me on.  ,5,4
"SCULLY: So, if its not man and its not animal, what the hell is it?  ",5,4
SCULLY: Where was that?  ,5,4
"SCULLY: (on phone) Okay. I get you. Thank you. All right. (Hangs up) (To MULDER) Local PD has all their resources looking out for a transient, a drifter whos wanted for a double homicide in Gasden, Alabama. They were amused when I told them what we were doing.  ",5,4
SCULLY: Why do you say that?  ,5,4
SCULLY: But for what purpose?  ,5,4
SCULLY: What enemy would that be?  ,5,4
SCULLY: You think this is about a housing tract?  ,5,4
SCULLY: Anything?  ,5,4
SCULLY: Isnt that a little strange?  ,5,4
"SCULLY: Well, it sure is beautiful, though.  ",5,4
SCULLY: What do you think killed those men?  ,5,4
SCULLY: Walt Whitman?  ,5,4
SCULLY: What is it?  ,5,4
SCULLY: Theyre trying to separate us  pull us away from the others. Lets go back.  ,5,4
"SCULLY: Michelle? Michelle?! (whisper)Jeez. (yells) Mulder, I need help! Mulder!  ",5,4
SCULLY: (voice) Over here!  ,5,4
SCULLY: Over here!  ,5,4
SCULLY: I dont know.  ,5,4
"SCULLY: She was walking right ahead of me. She was right here, and then she was just gone.  ",5,4
SCULLY: What the hells happening here?  ,5,4
"SCULLY: Mulder, hes right. We werent prepared for this. We have no way of telling them where we are. We dont have any food. Michelle had our only water. Look, Id like to find her, too, but I think the risks of that are just way too foolish.  ",5,4
SCULLY: (to MULDER) I dont have much faith that this device will do us any good.  ,5,4
SCULLY: Whatever it is that we were chasing did show up on the screen at first.  ,5,4
SCULLY: Nothing.  ,5,4
SCULLY: Except that were going in the right direction.  ,5,4
"SCULLY: Ticks. Ive heard that they can halt their metabolism for up to 18 years, essentially going into suspended animation until something warm-blooded comes along.  ",5,4
SCULLY: Why is that interesting?  ,5,4
"SCULLY: What would that be filed next to - - ""The Cockroach That Ate Cincinnati?""  ",5,4
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,5,4
SCULLY: (seeing movement in the trees) Everybody stand still. Theres something out there.  ,5,4
SCULLY: About 40 or 50 yards out.  ,5,4
SCULLY: I saw it. The woods have gone silent again.  ,5,4
SCULLY: Talk to him.  ,5,4
"SCULLY: Talk to him, Jeff!  ",5,4
"SCULLY: Mulder, its not on the screen.  ",5,4
SCULLY: I got it. (Fires 6 times.)  ,5,4
SCULLY: I dont know. It just stopped.  ,5,4
"SCULLY: Six, maybe seven.  ",5,4
SCULLY: Yep.  ,5,4
"SCULLY: What the hell is it, Mulder?  ",5,4
SCULLY: Mulder? Mulder!! (Runs toward where he was.)  ,5,4
SCULLY: Mulder!!  ,5,4
SCULLY: You okay?  ,5,4
SCULLY: You were an Indian Guide. Help me out here.  ,5,4
"SCULLY: I would, but I left my wallet in the car.  ",5,4
SCULLY: Trying to open my gun. (Her clip pops out.) If I can separate the shell from the casing maybe I can get the powder to ignite.  ,5,4
SCULLY: Do I detect a hint of negativity?  ,5,4
"SCULLY: Mulder, you need to keep warm. Your bodys still in shock.  ",5,4
"SCULLY: Well, maybe if it rains sleeping bags, youll get lucky.  ",5,4
SCULLY: Have you thought seriously about dying?  ,5,4
"SCULLY: When I was fighting my cancer, I was angry at the injustice of it and its meaninglessness. And then I realized that that was the struggle  to give it meaning. To make sense of it. Its like life.  ",5,4
SCULLY: (chuckle) I guess its like Las Vegas. The house always wins. (She breaks the bullet open.) Oh! Ta-da.  ,5,4
SCULLY: I identified with Bettys bustline.  ,5,4
"SCULLY: Could never have been married to Barney, though. The kids were cute.  ",5,4
SCULLY: Moth Men? Really?  ,5,4
SCULLY: (suppressing a laugh) Get over here. Im going to try and keep you warm. ( MULDER lies in her lap. She accidentally rubs his wounded shoulder. It hurts him.) Sorry.  ,5,4
"SCULLY: You sleep, Mulder.  ",5,4
SCULLY: Im not going to get tired.  ,5,4
SCULLY: No ... Mulder.  ,5,4
"SCULLY: Mulder, you dont want me to sing. I cant carry a tune.  ",5,4
"SCULLY: (slightly off key, no enthusiasm) Jeremiah was a bull frog ---  ",5,4
SCULLY: ... was a good friend of mine. Never understood a single word he said...  ,5,4
SCULLY: ... but I helped him drink his wine.  ,5,4
SCULLY: Joy .... to the world. All the boys and girls. Joy to the fishes in the deep blue sea. Joy to you and me.  ,5,4
"SCULLY: (about 20 yards away, holds up her gun. She is eating.) Mmmm....over here.  ",5,4
SCULLY: Im looking for food. I found some wild berries.  ,5,4
"SCULLY: Mulder, you never left my sight. (SCULLY disappears.)  ",5,4
SCULLY: (voice) Im down here.  ,5,4
SCULLY: (voice) I fell down a hole. (howel)  ,5,4
"SCULLY: Yeah, I landed on soft dirt .. kind of.  ",5,4
SCULLY: I dont know. Its pretty dark. ( She bumps into one of many hanging bodies.) Oh!  ,5,4
SCULLY: (Sees MICHELLE hanging.) I found Michelle.  ,5,4
"SCULLY: (Checking MICHELLE) Not for much longer. Mulder, we have to get her out of here.  ",5,4
SCULLY: I dont know. I .. Im in some kind of a chamber. Theres .. theres like some kind of network. (She sees CREATURE at one end of chamber.) Mulder...  ,5,4
SCULLY: Im not alone. (Checks her back.) I dont have my weapon. Mulder!?  ,5,4
"SCULLY: Jeez!! Mulder, are you okay?  ",5,4
"SCULLY: Mulder, look. There has to be a scientific explanation for this.  ",5,4
SCULLY: If they could see us now.  ,5,4
SCULLY: Were down here!  ,5,4
SCULLY: We need a ladder.  ,5,4
"SCULLY: Mulder, whats going on?  ",5,4
SCULLY: Kay.  ,5,4
SCULLY: Yeah.  ,5,4
SCULLY: Hello? Merry Christmas!  ,5,5
SCULLY: You're huge.  (They hug.)  ,5,5
SCULLY: This is the exact same layout as our old house.  ,5,5
SCULLY: Mom?  You okay?  ,5,5
"SCULLY: Bill? (No answer, the phone rings again.  She answers it.)  Scully residence...  ",5,5
"SCULLY: Yes, sorry, who is this?  ",5,5
SCULLY: Who... who is this?  (She hangs up.  Dana hangs up and calls a number.)  ,5,5
"SCULLY: This is Special Agent, Dana Scully.  My badge number is 2317616. Can you transfer me to your sound agent, please? I would like to trace the last number that was dialed into this phone.  ",5,5
"SCULLY: Scully, FBI.  Can you tell me what's going on here?  ",5,5
SCULLY: I received a phone call from this address.  It was a woman's voice.  She said that somebody here needed help.  ,5,5
SCULLY: About 20 minutes ago.  ,5,5
"SCULLY: Please, can you tell me what happened here?  ",5,5
"SCULLY: I thought it was a dead woman, just not the one in there.  ",5,5
"SCULLY: I know it's not possible, Bill, but it sounded just like her.  ",5,5
SCULLY: Our sister... Melissa.  ,5,5
SCULLY: What was their explanation?  ,5,5
SCULLY: Excuse me.  (She gets up and goes to the hallway.  She dials the phone.)  ,5,5
"SCULLY: Nothing.  Mom, I'm very happy for Bill and Tara.  ",5,5
"SCULLY: Oh, Mom. Several months ago, I learned that as a result of my abduction, of what they did to me, that I can not conceive a child.  (Margaret is sorry and hugs Dana)  ",5,5
SCULLY: It's okay.  I just never realized how much I wanted it until I couldn't have it.  ,5,5
SCULLY: Who is this?  Why are you doing this?  ,5,5
"SCULLY: Mr. Sim, my name is Dana Scully.  I'm sorry for your loss and I'm sorry to disturb you at this hour.  ",5,5
SCULLY: I received a phone call less than an hour ago.  I was addressed by name and told that I needed to help someone... a woman.  I traced the call and it came from your house.  ,5,5
"SCULLY: This is the second time this has happened, and I'd really like to get to the bottom of it.  ",5,5
SCULLY: Yes.  ,5,5
SCULLY: I understand.  ,5,5
SCULLY: I'd like everything you have on the Roberta Sim case.  ,5,5
"SCULLY: Whatever you call it, I'd appreciate seeing everything that you have.  (Pause) In the spirit of the season?  ",5,5
SCULLY: It says here that your precinct visited the Sims before.  Two weeks ago.  A domestic disturbance call?  ,5,5
SCULLY: They ran a tox screen?  ,5,5
SCULLY: It says they turned up high levels of doritriptan.  ,5,5
SCULLY: I'd like to borrow this. (Kresge nods okay.)  ,5,5
"SCULLY: She's adopted.  (Scully sighs and makes a cell phone call.) Danny, it's me, Dana... Yeah, Merry Christmas to you, too... I, ah, I'm wondering if you can do me a favor... I need the complete case files on my sister, Melissa Scully.  Yeah, crime scene and autopsy along with the PCR's that we ran.  Right, but I need you to send them to the San Diego field office.  As soon as possible. Ok.  Thanks, Danny.  ",5,5
SCULLY: What?  (Scully looks behind her and sees Bill)  ,5,5
SCULLY: Some of it.  (She closes the cover of the laptop.)  ,5,5
SCULLY: Just some unfinished business.  ,5,5
SCULLY: I've got a little work to do.  Can I join you guys later?  ,5,5
SCULLY: I'll... I'll rent a car.  ,5,5
SCULLY: I'd like to order an autopsy on Roberta Sim.  There's a possibility she was murdered.  ,5,5
SCULLY: I think that it may have been the husband.  ,5,5
SCULLY: No.  Thanks.  ,5,5
SCULLY: I took another look at the police photos this morning.  There were no hesitation cuts on Roberta Sim's wrists.  Suicide victims seldom make the fatal cut the first time.  ,5,5
SCULLY: No.  Why was the phone off the hook when you got to the Sim's house?  ,5,5
SCULLY: Your report says the husband called the police after he discovered his wife dead.  ,5,5
"SCULLY: But if the phone was off the hook when you arrived, how did he call you? Did he find the phone off the hook, call you, then have the presence of mind to return it to the way that he'd found it? Does that make sense to you?  ",5,5
SCULLY: I am suggesting that there are questions that beg for further investigation.  Order an autopsy.  ,5,5
"SCULLY: Stomach contents appear to include coffee, whole wheat toast and cantaloupe. No medicine tablets.  Empty sample packets of doritriptan succina were found but I find no evidence that any of the pills were ingested.  ",5,5
SCULLY: Then why didn't it show up in her stomach?  ,5,5
"SCULLY: No. I don't believe absorption would be that complete, not that close to her death.  ",5,5
"SCULLY: On the heel of her right foot.  Extremely tiny and easy to miss. It was meant to be overlooked. (The medical examiner is also there.) I believe that this woman was injected, anesthetized so he wouldn't fight back. Then her suicide was staged.  ",5,5
SCULLY: I say it justifies opening a murder investigation.  ,5,5
"SCULLY: Mr. Sim, where is your daughter now?  ",5,5
SCULLY: We'll check that out. (Scully and the female cop walk away.) I want you to analyze this.  Get a PCR on the blood. We need to identify whose it is. (The female cop takes it and leaves. Scully turns back to them. She sees out the window two men sitting in a car looking at the house. They drive away.)  ,5,5
"SCULLY: Mom... sit down. (She does) The woman who committed suicide has an adopted daughter, a three year old named Emily. I got a sample of Emily's blood and I had the lab run a test on her DNA. It's called a PCR test.  This... (she hands her one of the screens) is Emily's. (She hands over the other one.) And this, is Melissa's which we ran during her murder investigation. They match.  ",5,5
"SCULLY: It means, that this little girl Emily... is Melissa's daughter.  ",5,5
SCULLY: You can't deny that there is a remarkable resemblance.  ,5,5
"SCULLY: Mom, it's uncanny.  Emily looked exactly like Melissa. That's why I ordered the PCR test. Because her face may change, but her DNA can't.  ",5,5
"SCULLY: There's a 60% chance that Melissa is Emily's mother. I'll order a more comprehensive test, a RFLP. It'll take a couple of days, then we'll be sure.  ",5,5
"SCULLY: Mom, remember about four years ago and Melissa took off? She traveled up and down the west coast, we didn't know where she was half the time.  ",5,5
SCULLY: That was 1994.  Emily was born that November. She could have given it for adoption and none of us would have ever known.  ,5,5
"SCULLY: Mom, this has nothing to do with what I'm going through.  ",5,5
SCULLY: I'll be right down.  ,5,5
SCULLY: Not a problem.  ,5,5
SCULLY: What?  ,5,5
SCULLY: From where?  ,5,5
SCULLY: Dr. Calderon?  ,5,5
"SCULLY: (extending her hand to him) I'm Agent Dana Scully with the FBI, this is Detective Kresge with the San Diego Police Department.  ",5,5
SCULLY: You knew Mrs. Sim?  ,5,5
SCULLY: What were you treating her for?  ,5,5
SCULLY: What's her prognosis?  ,5,5
SCULLY: Then why were the checks made out to her mother?  ,5,5
SCULLY: She wanted to pull Emily from the program?  ,5,5
"SCULLY: Dr. Calderon, did you ever prescribe doritriptan injections to Emily during her treatment?  ",5,5
SCULLY: Where's Emily?  ,5,5
"SCULLY: Lets get you right in there. (She locks the car seat.) Lets get you buckled in here nice and safe, ok? (Emily sees her cross necklace. Emily touches it as Scully touched Emily's head.) You like that, huh? (Emily smiles. Scully takes it off and puts it around Emily's neck. The woman puts her hand on Scully's shoulder. It's time to go. Scully looks at Emily again.) I'll see you again soon, ok? (Emily nods. Scully gets out of the van and the woman shouts the door. Scully and Emily connect with each other are the woman gets in the driver's seat, starts the van and pulls away.  ",5,5
SCULLY: What's up?  ,5,5
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,5,5
SCULLY: I did.  ,5,5
SCULLY: We did.  ,5,5
"SCULLY: Yes, I do.  ",5,5
SCULLY: It does not matter where that phone call came from.  What matters is that there is a little girl who needs my help.  ,5,5
"SCULLY: Bill, I don't expect you to understand but I am not going to stand here and justify my motive. (Mrs. Scully interrupts.)  ",5,5
SCULLY: Hello?  ,5,5
SCULLY: He admitted to being in the house that morning?  ,5,5
SCULLY: What about the witnesses who said they saw him in the doctor's office at the time of the murder?  ,5,5
SCULLY: Maybe they weren't. Where is he now?  ,5,5
SCULLY: Did they identify themselves?  ,5,5
SCULLY: How long were they here?  ,5,5
SCULLY: Just now.  ,5,5
"SCULLY: Marshall Sim, Emily's adoptive father is dead. They made it look like a suicide, just like his wife.  ",5,5
SCULLY: No.  ,5,5
SCULLY: I think it might.  ,5,5
"SCULLY: Bill, that doesn't prove anything.  Melissa didn't have to be pregnant to have a baby. There's... there's in vitro fertilization, there's surrogate motherhood.  ",5,5
SCULLY: What dream?  ,5,5
SCULLY: Hi. Thanks for coming in on Christmas Eve.  ,5,5
"SCULLY: I don't understand. I mean, I think I have a right to know why you're rejecting my application.  ",5,5
"SCULLY: Well, it's one I've given a great deal of thought to. I mean, to be honest, I've started to question my priorities since I was first diagnosed with cancer. (Scully starts crying.) I feel like I was given a second chance. Ever since I was a child, I've never allowed to let myself get too close to people.  I've avoided emotional attachment. Perhaps I've been so afraid of death and dying that any connection just seemed like a bad thing... something that wouldn't last. But I don't feel that anymore.  ",5,5
SCULLY: I realize that.  And I feel like I'm ready.  ,5,5
SCULLY: Merry Christmas. (They shake hands.)  ,5,5
SCULLY: Melissa?  ,5,5
SCULLY: I couldn't sleep. (Melissa walks around and sits on the end of the couch with Dana.)  ,5,5
SCULLY: I guess I'm afraid of making a big mistake.  I could tell Dad sure thinks I am.  ,5,5
"SCULLY: (Her hair is longer, like when the show first started) I know that. You know, when I first started med school, it felt so right. It seemed like that was where I was supposed to be. And then by the time I graduated, I just knew it was wrong. But now the FBI feels right. And... what if that's wrong too?  ",5,5
SCULLY: God! You sound like a greeting card. I don't believe in fate. I think we have to choose our own path.  ,5,5
SCULLY: Which is what?  ,5,5
SCULLY: Merry Christmas.  (She opens the package and stumbles to the living room. The others look at her.)  ,5,5
SCULLY: It's the DNA test on Emily Sim's blood.  ,5,5
"SCULLY: It says, definitely, that Melissa is not Emily's mother, but that they found striking genetic similarities between Emily and Melissa, so many that they ran a test against another sample that they already had.  ",5,5
SCULLY: According to this... I am Emily's mother.  ,5,5
"SCULLY: ""Dear Special Agent Mulder: Im writing to you for help. Several years ago I had an experience I could not explain. I was lying in my bed when I felt a presence in the room. Though I was awake. I felt that something had taken control over my body. I dont remember much else but I woke up three days later pregnant with my son, Izzy. (MULDER and SCULLY look at each other.) That was 18 years ago, but now it happened again. I was in bed and could swear I heard Cher singing  The one who was married to Sonny. (Another look.) Then the room got all smoky, and I saw some kind of monster. He had a really gross face with lumps all over his head. I was too scared to scream. Then I got all groggy and conked out for three days. Guess what happened when I woke up? I got your name off the TV. Some lady on the Jerry Springer show who had a werewolf baby said you came to her house. (SCULLY looks at MULDER accusingly. He looks guilty.) Well, I got her story beat by a mile so maybe youll want to come see me, too. Sincerely, Shaineh Berkowitz.""  ",5,6
"SCULLY: Uh, Mrs. Berkowitz? You said that you also had a son?  ",5,6
SCULLY: And Izzy is the product of your union with some kind of intruder?  ,5,6
SCULLY: Did you report this to the police?  ,5,6
SCULLY: Was there an investigation?  ,5,6
SCULLY: And now youre pregnant again?  ,5,6
"SCULLY: You were gone for three days, but nobody missed you?  ",5,6
"SCULLY: Do you drink, Mrs. Berkowitz?  ",5,6
SCULLY: Is there no chance that your son could have put it there?  ,5,6
SCULLY: Mrs. Berkowitz? You gave a description of the intruder. You said that he had a gross face and lumps on his head?  ,5,6
SCULLY: Funny. Sounds just like this. (MULDER comes to her side and looks at the comic book. SCULLY holds it up for SHAINEH.)  ,5,6
SCULLY: We were wondering how this suspect in your mothers case looks exactly like this?  ,5,6
SCULLY: Youve seen the Great Mutato?  ,5,6
SCULLY: Has it crossed neither of your minds that what you say you saw that night fits perfectly with this creature that your son created?  ,5,6
SCULLY: (to MULDER) Peanut butter sandwiches?  ,5,6
"SCULLY: Why are you humoring them, Mulder?  ",5,6
SCULLY: So is perjury. So is calling out FBI agents under false pretenses.  ,5,6
SCULLY: Isnt it obvious? (MULDER shakes his head.) I think that what were seeing here is an example of the culture for whom daytime talk shows and tabloid headlines have - have become a reality against which they measure their lives  a culture so obsessed with the media and a chance for self-dramatization that theyll do anything in order to gain a spotlight.  ,5,6
"SCULLY: Psychologists often speak of the denial of an unthinkable evil or a misplacement of shared fears. (MULDER leans against the hood of their car, SCULLY stands in front of him.) Anxieties taking the form of a hideous monster for whom the most horrific human attributes can be ascribed. What we cant possibly imagine ourselves capable of we can blame on the ogre, on the hunchback, on the lowly half-breed. (TD NOTE: Perfect opportunity for Cher's song, ""Half-Breed"", don'tcha think?!)  ",5,6
"SCULLY: But common sense alone will tell you that these legends, these unverified rumors are ridiculous.  ",5,6
"SCULLY: Is there anything that you dont believe in, Mulder?  ",5,6
SCULLY: Whats that sound?  ,5,6
SCULLY: Whered it go?  ,5,6
SCULLY: We were just chasing what they told us was a monster.  ,5,6
SCULLY: What achievements are those?  ,5,6
"SCULLY: Well, Im a scientist, for one.  ",5,6
"SCULLY: (on the spot) I, uh  I believe it has something to do with, um  growth and development.  ",5,6
"SCULLY: Sir, unless you want your scientific achievements to end up as a footnote on the Jerry Springer Show, I suggest that you make the time.  ",5,6
SCULLY: . Growing out of his mouth.  ,5,6
"SCULLY: Despite what you might think, Mulder, designer mutations like these are virtually impossible in humans.  ",5,6
"SCULLY: Mulder, even if they could, no scientist would even dare to perform this kind of experiment on a human.  ",5,6
"SCULLY: To unlock the mysteries of genetics, to understand how it is that even though we share the same genes we develop arms instead of wings. We become humans instead of flies or monsters.  ",5,6
"SCULLY: We already have that ability, Mulder. Its called ""procreation."" And first thing tomorrow morning, Im going to verify the pregnancy of Shaineh Berkowitz.  ",5,6
SCULLY: Weve been had. Ill save you the trouble of reading the article. It has everything we talked about last night word for word.  ,5,6
SCULLY: We have reason to believe that you or one of your friends recorded our conversation last night and gave it to a newspaper reporter.  ,5,6
SCULLY: In order to promote you comic book monster that you created.  ,5,6
SCULLY: (recorded voice)  in the form of a hideous monster given the most horrific human attributes   ,5,6
SCULLY: (recorded voice)  What we cant possibly imagine  ,5,6
SCULLY: Who the hell is that?  ,5,6
SCULLY: Where are we going now?  ,5,6
"SCULLY: Mulder, this is just a dopey hoax.  ",5,6
SCULLY: And you think that Dr. Pollidori has something to do with it?  ,5,6
"SCULLY: Mulder, Im alarmed that you would reduce this man to a literary stereotype, a mad scientist.  ",5,6
"SCULLY: I have to admit, Mulder. Everything looks in order. Mrs. Berkowitz had a tubal ligation in 1993 and two months ago she had two pregnancy tests both with positive results.  ",5,6
SCULLY: What are you doing?  ,5,6
SCULLY: Yeah. So?  ,5,6
SCULLY: (coughing) Come on  Get up! Move!  ,5,6
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,5,6
"SCULLY: Sir, with all due respect I think that this is all part of a hoax.  ",5,6
SCULLY: A shameless publicity stunt.  ,5,6
SCULLY: Mulder . You may have been right. That these people can be reduced to cultural stereotypes?  ,5,6
SCULLY: I may have found something that says otherwise. The residue in the frying pan was an agricultural product used to anesthetize herds of animals.  ,5,6
SCULLY: Farmers  who have to register with the FDA even to have it in their possession.  ,5,6
SCULLY: Mm - hmm.  ,5,6
SCULLY: (has found the disturbed earth over the grave) Mulder.  ,5,6
"SCULLY: If youre armed, drop your weapon and walk out slowly!  ",5,6
SCULLY: By whom?  ,5,6
SCULLY: What makes you think hes here?  ,5,6
SCULLY: Theres only one way Pollidori could have seen that monster  If he was out here himself.  ,5,6
SCULLY: Mulder.  ,5,6
"SCULLY: Federal agents, and were armed! Come on out!  ",5,6
SCULLY: Oh...  ,5,6
"SCULLY: Oh, my God.  ",5,6
SCULLY: Were not going to hurt you. (to MULDER) Do you think he understands?  ,5,6
SCULLY: He looks frightened.  ,5,6
"SCULLY: We should go, Mulder. The prisoners in the car.  ",5,6
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,5,6
"SCULLY: Theres not going to be any bride, Mulder. Not in this story.  ",5,6
SCULLY'S VOICE OVER: ,5,7
"SCULLY: Emily? I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.  His name is Mulder. Remember, I told you about him?  ",5,7
SCULLY: She's a little shy.  ,5,7
"SCULLY: I'll be right back. (Scully and Mulder rise and walk away from her as they talk) Thank you for coming. Something's wrong, isn't it?  ",5,7
SCULLY: You got a name?  ,5,7
SCULLY: Fugazzi?  ,5,7
SCULLY: I don't understand. Why create a false record?  ,5,7
SCULLY: How did she come into this world?  ,5,7
"SCULLY: Well, she was born to someone, she... she has to belong to someone.  ",5,7
SCULLY: I can protect her too.  ,5,7
"SCULLY: I know... I've considered that, but I've also considered that there's only one right thing to do. (A woman approaches Emily.)  ",5,7
SCULLY: Because I couldn't believe it. But I need you now to be a witness on my behalf in this hearing.  ,5,7
SCULLY: Then why are you here?  ,5,7
SCULLY: It takes two of us just to get my sister-in-law into bed these days.  ,5,7
"SCULLY: Two weeks ago. (Long pause) Why didn't you tell me, Mulder?  ",5,7
SCULLY: Why would they do this to me?  ,5,7
SCULLY: Children being created for who?  ,5,7
"SCULLY: Hello? Hello? (She looks at Mulder who gets out his cell phone.) Hello, is anybody there?  ",5,7
"SCULLY: Mulder, it's ...  ",5,7
SCULLY: She's burning up.  ,5,7
"SCULLY: Oh, my God. (There's a patch of green)  ",5,7
SCULLY: How is she?  ,5,7
SCULLY: Do you know what's causing it?  ,5,7
SCULLY: I'm her mother.  ,5,7
SCULLY: I know that she was being treated for anemia.  ,5,7
SCULLY: I was told that it was some kind of auto immune hemolytic anemia. Her treatment was experimental.  ,5,7
SCULLY: His name is Calderon.  ,5,7
SCULLY: They have her under a mild sedative.  ,5,7
SCULLY: How did you know?  ,5,7
"SCULLY: So what now? She's still just a little girl. You say I can't protect her, but I can't let this be her life. Just a few days ago she was fine.  ",5,7
SCULLY: He can't do that. He's endangering her life.  ,5,7
SCULLY: It's an ethical violation .  ,5,7
"SCULLY: Well, authority or not, I'm not leaving her side.  ",5,7
SCULLY: Can you give me a minute with her?  (The woman nods.  Scully adjusts her mask and goes into the room.)  ,5,7
SCULLY: We just want you to get better.  That's what these tests are for.  ,5,7
SCULLY: I hope you know what this is.  ,5,7
SCULLY: Is it cancer?  ,5,7
SCULLY: Can you put her on antivirals?  ,5,7
"SCULLY: No, you can't do that.  Her immune system's too weak.  ",5,7
"SCULLY: Dr. Calderon? (She rushes to Emily's room and sees Emily laying on her side-stomach away from her.  She goes to the hallway and tells a nurse) Get Dr. Vinet in there and call the police.  (She sees Calderon clone down the hallway. She runs after him.) Dr. Calderon? (He walks through the hall without turning back.  There are a lot of people around. Scully takes out her gun and points it at him, people collapse against the wall.) Halt! Dr. Calderon! FBI! (A burly orderly is walking toward Calderon. Scully yells to him) Stop that man! (He tackles him.  Scully runs up the him, grabs his shoulder and turns him around.  It's another older gentleman.)  ",5,7
SCULLY (on phone): Mulder where are you?  ,5,7
"SCULLY: What do you mean, you've been following him.  I just saw him.  There was a scare here. (Scully is at the hospital and looks over at Emily.  She's being tended by the doctor) He was here, he came into Emily's room.  It appears he injected her with something.  ",5,7
"SCULLY: She seems to be, but we're running a tox screen anyway. (She walks down the hall as she talks and she sees men come down a perpendicular hallway.  She raises her hand to them.)  ",5,7
SCULLY: What are you talking about? (The men are two cops and Detective Kresge)  ,5,7
"SCULLY: Mulder, that doesn't make any sense.  Why would he endanger her before only to protect her now?  ",5,7
SCULLY: Detective.  ,5,7
SCULLY: Thanks for coming down.  ,5,7
SCULLY: That might not be necessary.  ,5,7
SCULLY: There seems to be some indication that he came here to help her.  ,5,7
"SCULLY: Because Emily's mother wanted to stop the tests, just like I did, and I guess that's why he came here because as much as they want to remove anything that gets in their way, it seems they need Emily to continue the tests.  ",5,7
SCULLY: I don't understand.  Just an hour ago you said she was getting better.  ,5,7
SCULLY: It's killing her.  ,5,7
"SCULLY: Ms. Chambliss, I am a medical doctor.  And the decisions that I make are reasonable and right.  ",5,7
SCULLY:  No.  That is not true.  The injection that Dr. Calderon gave her is actually making her worse.  ,5,7
SCULLY: Do you think I don't want what's best for this child? Do you think that I'm not trying to save her life?  ,5,7
"SCULLY: You can get a court order and you can try to enforce it, but I suggest that if you're going to do what's best for this child, then you do everything in your power to tell the authorities that if they take Emily out of this hospital, they are going to hasten her illness.  And I'll let it be known that all of you are responsible. (She walks to the door.)  ",5,7
"SCULLY: I don't know yet, but I will.  (Scully leaves)  ",5,7
"SCULLY: You okay in there, Emily. (She nods) Good. I'm going to be right here the whole time, okay? (She nods again.) Now we're just going to put some extra air in there, so you tell me if your ears start to hurt.  (Scully nods to a tech. He turns the air up. A dial shows the pressure building. They put it up to 200. Emily starts to get uncomfortable) You okay, Sweetie? (Emily shakes her head no and is starting to cry.) Turn it off! (Scully looks in the chamber.  Emily's arm looks like every vein is popped to the surface) Turn it off, NOW!  ",5,7
SCULLY: Hold on Sweetie. Settle down.  We'll get you out of there as fact as we can.  ,5,7
"SCULLY: She's gone into a coma. (Mulder looks around at where to turn, what to say. He looks at Scully.) I'm okay, Mulder. It's what's meant to be.  ",5,7
SCULLY: I wouldn't. I wouldn't do it to her.  ,5,7
"SCULLY: Mulder, whoever brought this child into this world... didn't intend to love her.  ",5,7
SCULLY: I have a chance to stop that. You were right. This child... was not meant to be.  ,5,7
SCULLY: I think I'd like to be alone. (Mulder leaves.)  ,5,7
"SCULLY: I think I'll ride back with Mulder. (Scully stands and hugs her mother. She hugs Bill. She looks to see Tara standing behind him in the aisle holding her new born baby. Scully smiles to Tara and kisses the baby's forehead.) Bye, bye Matthew. (She caresses his forehead and kisses Tara goodbye.)  ",5,7
SCULLY: Who are the men who would create a life whose only hope was to die?  ,5,7
SCULLY: She found me.  ,5,7
SCULLY: How's Detective Kresge?  ,5,7
SCULLY: And the men who did this to him?  ,5,7
SCULLY: There is evidence of what they did.  ,5,7
"SCULLY: To win makes him feel important. He likes to think of himself as a ronan - a warrior without a master, adhering to the budo, the Japanese way of war. In truth, he's a highly intelligent sociopath who has no fear of dying. In keeping with his game archetype, he likes to leave clues. This is why we expect to be contacted by him, hopefully sooner rather than later.  ",5,8
SCULLY: Extremely weakened. The doctors here say that he can barely even walk.  ,5,8
"SCULLY: Yeah, Mulder, I'm amazed he's even alive ... the condition that we last saw him in, comatose with a bullet in the head.  ",5,8
"SCULLY: Well, apparently one day about six months ago, he simply woke up. It's unusual, but it's not unheard of.  ",5,8
SCULLY: It still is.  ,5,8
SCULLY: He has a physical therapist. Mulder ... what if Modell plans to pick up where he left off? Where does that leave you? You were his prime target. Should you even be heading this investigation?  ,5,8
SCULLY: That it's exactly what he wants. That once again you're playing his game.  ,5,8
SCULLY: (reading the visitors log) It says here that Modell had a visitor yesterday afternoon.  ,5,8
SCULLY: It's marked LSC.  ,5,8
"SCULLY: (softly, as he reaches for the phone) Mulder?  ",5,8
SCULLY: (to agent monitoring the trace) Time?  ,5,8
SCULLY: (to Mulder) Don't let him rope you in.  ,5,8
"SCULLY: Mulder, hang up the phone.  ",5,8
SCULLY: There's nothing back there.  ,5,8
SCULLY: Appears as if he died from ingesting paint. I imagine that he did all of this and then drank what was left.  ,5,8
SCULLY: (looking toward the paint can on the floor) Cerulean blue.  ,5,8
SCULLY: Maybe his choice of victim. This is Nathan Bowman with the Loudoun County attorney's office. He's the prosecutor that tried Modell in 1996.  ,5,8
SCULLY: Fox Mulder.  ,5,8
SCULLY: (checking the body's ring finger and finding a wedding band) Yep.  ,5,8
SCULLY: It's him.  ,5,8
SCULLY: Why Bowman's wife? What would he want with her?  ,5,8
SCULLY: Mrs. Bowman? Did your husband ever discuss his work as a prosecutor with you?  ,5,8
SCULLY: Did he ever mention the name Robert Patrick Modell?  ,5,8
"SCULLY: Yes, sir.  ",5,8
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,5,8
"SCULLY: Well, hopefully, he wasn't capable.  ",5,8
"SCULLY: Well, we've seen that before.  ",5,8
"SCULLY: (on radio) Where are you, Mulder?  ",5,8
"SCULLY: Mulder, what happened? Where's Modell?  ",5,8
SCULLY: (on her cell phone) About 10 minutes ago. He can't have gotten far. (to a marshall coming out of the building) Anything?  ,5,8
"SCULLY: (to phone) Yes, Agent Mulder's fine. Yes, sir.  ",5,8
SCULLY: How are you feeling?  ,5,8
"SCULLY: It could have happened to anyone, Mulder.  ",5,8
SCULLY: Which was what?  ,5,8
SCULLY: Whose game? His?  ,5,8
SCULLY: What are you talking about? Of course he is. You said yourself that he was gonna pick up where he left off.  ,5,8
SCULLY: He killed Nathan Bowman.  ,5,8
"SCULLY: Mulder, this man's affected you. He's influenced your thinking.  ",5,8
SCULLY: A man is made to drink a gallon of cerulean blue paint. Kitsunegari - fox hunt. You're saying now that's not Modell?  ,5,8
SCULLY: That's your opinion?  ,5,8
SCULLY: How can you be sure it's your own?  ,5,8
SCULLY: Your husband talked with you a lot about it.  ,5,8
SCULLY: Is it possible that he could have mentioned you to Robert Modell?  ,5,8
SCULLY: What?  ,5,8
SCULLY: You tell me.  ,5,8
"SCULLY: Mulder, no. I'm sorry. You said it yourself, you said ""don't listen to Modell, don't trust him"". But you've done both.  ",5,8
"SCULLY: Mulder, I think you should do what he says.  ",5,8
SCULLY: (to phone) Scully.  ,5,8
SCULLY: Where are you?  ,5,8
"SCULLY: Mulder, you were told to lay off.  ",5,8
SCULLY: It was Modell.  ,5,8
SCULLY: Mulder ...  ,5,8
SCULLY: Would have? You don't know that.  ,5,8
"SCULLY: Mulder, I'm not at the safe house.  ",5,8
"SCULLY: We're at the Chain Bridge Mall, investigating a suicide.  ",5,8
SCULLY: (hangs up) (to marshall) Back in the trucks ...  ,5,8
SCULLY: (to Skinner) Did he try to speak to you?  ,5,8
SCULLY: We haven't found the gun yet.  ,5,8
SCULLY: For what possible reason?  ,5,8
SCULLY: Linda Bowman?  ,5,8
"SCULLY: That's one hell of a plan, Mulder. A serial killer makes us believe that he's guilty, in turn diverting the suspicion away from the real estate lady. Well, he had me going.  ",5,8
"SCULLY: They've taken her home. There is no reason to keep her in protective custody, Mulder. It is over.  ",5,8
SCULLY: Where are you going?  ,5,8
"SCULLY: Mulder, talking to him has already done you enough harm.  ",5,8
SCULLY: Mulder ...  ,5,8
"SCULLY: (to phone) Yes, we'd like an ambulance to 214 Channel Avenue.  ",5,8
"SCULLY: She has an advanced temporal lobe tumor, just like Modell's. It seems to run in the family.  ",5,8
SCULLY: Fraternal twins.  ,5,8
"SCULLY: Apparently, she only found out about his existence six months ago. They were separated when they were two weeks ago, raised apart. Her ""fox hunt"" ... I'm guessing that she wanted revenge for what she feels we did to her brother.  ",5,8
"SCULLY: 12 pounds, 9 ounces.  ",5,9
SCULLY: Most of it. The small amount in his lungs is what killed him.  ,5,9
"SCULLY: Well, Im sure if Mr. Rich were alive he would find some humor in that. According to his police report, Mr. Rich was a man who could tell a joke. He grew up here. Worked the same fields for 20 years. Well liked around town. Funny he should turn up murdered.  ",5,9
SCULLY: I have concluded is that this mans head was held forcibly down in the Michigan mud just a little too long. Most likely by his stepson who was named in the report as Bobby Rich. Age 16.  ,5,9
SCULLY: There is some indication that his stepson may have dug the hole and that a recent rainstorm may have helped turn it into a muddy trap.  ,5,9
SCULLY: They say it rained 400 inches a day.  ,5,9
SCULLY: Would you like me to show you how he may have done it?  ,5,9
SCULLY: (showing bruise on PHILs ankle) He may have had an accomplice.  ,5,9
SCULLY: And it came to a head last night?  ,5,9
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,5,9
SCULLY: Did Phil instigate what happened?  ,5,9
SCULLY: Could you tell that he was definitely trying to help him?  ,5,9
"SCULLY: You know, theres a strong chance the police are going to arrest your son for murder.  ",5,9
"SCULLY: But if they do, and if theres evidence of abuse that youre not coming forward with, it could hurt his chances.  ",5,9
"SCULLY: (coming out of house) Theyre all dying. According to Bobbys mother, thats a big reason why her husband blew up. His hazelnut orchard was hit with a blight.  ",5,9
"SCULLY: Well not in so many words. Actually, she wont admit to any abuse in the house. I suspect shes just trying to move on and protect what family shes got left.  ",5,9
SCULLY: Thats his excuse?  ,5,9
SCULLY: What do you think?  ,5,9
"SCULLY: Well, even if he didnt dig this hole, the disease could have killed root systems creating weakened soil.  ",5,9
"SCULLY: Well, when you fight for air a vacuum is created. And maybe once he sucked down a mouthful of mud it turned his esophagus into a siphon. With his head pushed down, it filled all of his passages like a gas can.  ",5,9
SCULLY: Well  you asked me for answers. Those are the best ones Ive got.  ,5,9
SCULLY: His mother says that Bobby cant make friends. Hes been in therapy for his anger since 1995.  ,5,9
SCULLY: Someones watching us. Sir? Hello.  ,5,9
SCULLY: I dont know. Hes gone.  ,5,9
SCULLY: Were Agents Mulder and Scully with the FBI.  ,5,9
SCULLY: In what way?  ,5,9
"SCULLY: If you know that Bobby committed a crime, youre under legal obligation to tell us.  ",5,9
"SCULLY: The victims name was  Eugene Baiocchi, forties. He was a foreman for one of the local growers. Single parent.  ",5,9
"SCULLY: It had already been removed. I think its pretty clear what killed him, though. From what theyve put together, theyve all but concluded he was pushed out the window.  ",5,9
SCULLY: His daughter Lisa made the 911 call at 8:08 p.m. She says she and her father had a fight.  ,5,9
SCULLY: Bobby.  ,5,9
SCULLY: Can I have a moment  with Lisa?  ,5,9
SCULLY: Three guesses who followed Lisa home last night and was sitting out front in his fathers truck just minutes before this happened.  ,5,9
SCULLY: She thinks hes quite capable.  ,5,9
"SCULLY: Well, she says that he also threatened to kill a boy in school yesterday.  ",5,9
SCULLY: I dont understand.  ,5,9
SCULLY: How?  ,5,9
"SCULLY: Well, theres nowhere to stand. Even if he did use a ladder thered be no leverage. I mean, especially for a scrawny 16-year-old kid.  ",5,9
"SCULLY: Sorry to interrupt. (to BOBBY) I need to ask you to come with us, please.  ",5,9
SCULLY: To answer some questions.  ,5,9
SCULLY: I dont want to have to embarrass you in front of your class.  ,5,9
"SCULLY: No, Im not.  ",5,9
SCULLY: (quietly) You just trying to scare him?  ,5,9
SCULLY: (quietly) Of what?  ,5,9
SCULLY: What are you looking for?  ,5,9
SCULLY: Where did it come from?  ,5,9
SCULLY: What?  ,5,9
SCULLY: What? You think that Bobby climbed this tree to pull Lisas father out of that window?  ,5,9
SCULLY: Who are you?  ,5,9
SCULLY: I didnt expect you to be standing right there behind me. You were watching us the other day in the orchard.  ,5,9
"SCULLY: Maybe you should come down here, Mulder. (to OLD MAN, holding out wood splinter) You, uh, know what kind of tree this came from?  ",5,9
"SCULLY: You, uh  you said these trees were dying. This, this splinters live wood.  ",5,9
SCULLY: Is Lisa still staying with you?  ,5,9
"SCULLY: Mulder, whatever youre hoping we find here  without a court order, it wont be admissible.  ",5,9
SCULLY: Mulder  Wheres the body?  ,5,9
"SCULLY: Mulder, you still havent answered my question. What happened to Karins father? Why would anybody steal his body?  ",5,9
SCULLY: No. Thats what we were doing.  ,5,9
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,5,9
SCULLY: Im a little afraid to ask what kind of connection.  ,5,9
"SCULLY: Bobbys father, Lisas father   ",5,9
"SCULLY: Mulder, there is a connection between these deaths  one that provides a clear motive and intent: These were abused children   ",5,9
SCULLY: What? So nature did it for them?  ,5,9
SCULLY: I called Lisa at her aunts house 20 minutes ago and there was no answer.  ,5,9
"SCULLY: Mulder, weve already questioned him twice.  ",5,9
SCULLY: Mulder   ,5,9
SCULLY: What the hell is going on here?  ,5,9
SCULLY: But how did he get here?  ,5,9
"SCULLY: Mulder, I   ",5,9
SCULLY: You think Karin is the killer?  ,5,9
SCULLY: Youre going to be okay.  ,5,9
SCULLY: (on phone) Scully.  ,5,10
"SCULLY: (on phone, voice) Mulder, I thought we had an agreement. We were both going to take the weekend off.  ",5,10
"SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, Im on vacation. The weather is clear. Im looking forward to hitting the road and breathing in some of this fine New England air.  ",5,10
SCULLY: (on phone) Why?  ,5,10
"SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, Im hanging up. Im turning off my cell phone. Im back in the office on Monday.  ",5,10
"SCULLY: Sir  Sir, what happened?  ",5,10
SCULLY: Im .. my name is Scully. Im an FBI agent. What happened to you?  ,5,10
"SCULLY: (on phone, voice) Mulder, its me.  ",5,10
"SCULLY: (on phone, voice) I am. Im up in Maine.  ",5,10
"SCULLY: (on phone, voice) I dont  I mean, I do. I . (moaning from TV is loud) What are you watching, Mulder?  ",5,10
"SCULLY: (on phone) I, uh  Im at a market here. Im just trying to give the local PD a handle here.  ",5,10
"SCULLY: (on phone) Well, Im not quite sure how to describe it, Mulder. I didnt witness it myself but there seems to be some kind of an outbreak of people acting in a violent, involuntary way.  ",5,10
"SCULLY: (on phone, voice) Toward themselves.  ",5,10
"SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah. Beating at their faces, clawing at their eyes. One man is dead.  ",5,10
"SCULLY: (on phone) Self-inflicted, it appears.  ",5,10
"SCULLY: (on phone) No, I dont think its witchcraft, Mulder, or sorcery. Ive had a look around and I dont see any evidence that warrants that kind of suspicion.  ",5,10
"SCULLY: (on phone) Like evidence of conjury or the black arts or shamanism, divination, Wicca or any kind of pagan or neo-Pagan practice. Charms, cards .  ",5,10
"SCULLY: (on phone)  familiars, bloodstones, or hex signs or any of the ritual tableaux associated with the occult, Santeria, Voudoun, Macumba, or any high or low magic?  ",5,10
SCULLY: (on phone) Yes?  ,5,10
SCULLY: (on phone) I was hoping for something a little more helpful.  ,5,10
"SCULLY: (on phone) Thanks anyway. (hangs up, looks at tape again)  ",5,10
SCULLY: (to OFFICER BUDDY RIGGS) Whos that woman right there?  ,5,10
SCULLY: Shes the only one Ive seen who looks unaffected.  ,5,10
SCULLY: You might want to talk to her.  ,5,10
SCULLY: Yes. Im on vacation. Why?  ,5,10
SCULLY: Hows that?  ,5,10
"SCULLY: Well, thats not the first time for that accusation in these parts.  ",5,10
"SCULLY: Look, to be honest with you, Captain Bonsaint, um, Im not much of a believer in witchcraft.  ",5,10
SCULLY: But now youre not convinced?  ,5,10
SCULLY: What one thing is that?  ,5,10
SCULLY: Who shes been carrying on with?  ,5,10
SCULLY: Back doors wide open.  ,5,10
SCULLY: Chief? Take a look at this.  ,5,10
SCULLY: It looks like she was afraid of something.  ,5,10
SCULLY: You know her?  ,5,10
SCULLY: Mm-hmm.  ,5,10
SCULLY: The daughters autistic?  ,5,10
SCULLY: Slapped her? What for?  ,5,10
SCULLY: The little girl did?  ,5,10
"SCULLY: This ah, this affair that the mother was having with the butcher ?  ",5,10
"SCULLY: So, it was unrequited.  ",5,10
SCULLY: To the extent that shed have to nail her windows shut?  ,5,10
SCULLY: Like what?  ,5,10
"SCULLY: Miss Froelich, my names Dana Scully. Im with the FBI. I just happen to be here on vacation , and uh   ",5,10
"SCULLY: So, I just am helping out the chief here.  ",5,10
SCULLY: Who?  ,5,10
SCULLY: New England hospitality. Heard about it my whole life. Finally got a chance to experience it for myself.  ,5,10
SCULLY: This family tree of Melissa Turners...  ,5,10
"SCULLY: Its all talk, isnt it?  ",5,10
"SCULLY: Well, I think you need to bring her in to straighten this out.  ",5,10
SCULLY: That she might know something.  ,5,10
"SCULLY: Well, about what Im sure is a perfectly reasonable explanation for all of this.  ",5,10
"SCULLY: Well, I wish I could help you out. You know, Im just  on vacation.  ",5,10
SCULLY: With what?  ,5,10
SCULLY: (on phone) Hello?  ,5,10
SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder?  ,5,10
SCULLY: (on phone) Needed your help on what?  ,5,10
SCULLY: (on phone) I was up and out this morning. Mulder?  ,5,10
SCULLY: (on phone) Whats that noise? Where are you?  ,5,10
"SCULLY: (on phone) A scientific explanation?  MULDER: (on phone) Yeah, a medical cause. Something called chorea.  ",5,10
SCULLY: (on phone) Dancing sickness.  ,5,10
"SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah, and hasnt been diagnosed since the Middle Ages.  ",5,10
SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder?  ,5,10
SCULLY: (on phone) Thanks for the help. (Hangs up.)  ,5,10
SCULLY: Yep.  ,5,10
SCULLY: (definitive) No.  ,5,10
"SCULLY: You know, Chief Bonsaint  Jack  can I call you Jack? Ive been thinking that maybe  maybe we need to explore other possibilities.  ",5,10
"SCULLY: Well, maybe we need to keep our minds open to  extreme possibilities.  ",5,10
"SCULLY: Oh, my god! That looks like something out of Jules Verne. Were supposed to eat that?  ",5,10
"SCULLY: Ive been thinking about Melissa Turner. Now, you said that her husband died in a boating accident?  ",5,10
"SCULLY: Well, was there anything strange about that? About the way that it happened?  ",5,10
SCULLY: Hows that?  ,5,10
SCULLY: Was Melissa ever questioned about that?  ,5,10
SCULLY: I saw that man at the market.  ,5,10
SCULLY: You were on board the night that he died. What do you think?  ,5,10
SCULLY: Peoples stories change.  ,5,10
SCULLY: Who do you blame?  ,5,10
SCULLY: And you know what killed him.  ,5,10
SCULLY: But you saw something in that grocery store. That little girl and her dolly.  ,5,10
SCULLY: (on phone) Scully  ,5,10
SCULLY: (on phone) Then whyd you call?  ,5,10
"SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, are there any references in occult literature to objects that have the power to direct human behavior?  ",5,10
"SCULLY: (on phone) Um, like a doll, for instance.  ",5,10
"SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah, kind of like that. (MULDER gets up and crosses to his desk)  ",5,10
SCULLY: (on phone) I was just curious.  ,5,10
"SCULLY: (on phone) No, no. Of course not.  ",5,10
SCULLY: Lets go talk to Melissa Turner.  ,5,10
SCULLY: Unh-uh.  ,5,10
SCULLY: Melissa? Melissa? Bonsaint!  ,5,10
SCULLY: (outside) Shes got the door nailed shut. Shes trying to kill herself.  ,5,10
SCULLY: Melissa! Melissa!  ,5,10
SCULLY: Melissa!  ,5,10
"SCULLY: Put it down, Melissa.  ",5,10
"SCULLY: (kneels next to POLLY.) Give me the doll, Polly.  ",5,10
"SCULLY: Polly, give me the doll.  ",5,10
SCULLY: I feel fine.  ,5,10
SCULLY: That poster  Whered you get it?  ,5,10
SCULLY: Hmm.  ,5,10
SCULLY: No. I just  wanted to send one to somebody.  ,5,10
SCULLY: Mm-hmm.  ,5,10
"SCULLY: Oh, just  some guy. (pause) Jack. ""M"" Street?  ",5,10
"SCULLY: What case? Uh, yeah. Yes it does.  ",5,10
"SCULLY: Me? No. No. I was, uh, I was on vacation. Just  getting out of my own head for a few days. What about you? Did you, uh, did you get anything done while I was gone?  ",5,10
"SCULLY: Oh, I dont know. I think some things are better left unexplained.  ",5,10
SCULLY: Looks like they crashed the wrong party.  ,5,11
SCULLY: Pico Salazar?  ,5,11
"SCULLY: A foreign national with his kind of connections? What would he be doing here, let alone in the country?  ",5,11
"SCULLY: Mulder, these are street level coke dealers... Minor wholesalers at most.  ",5,11
SCULLY: What would they be doing here?  ,5,11
SCULLY: (give MULDER *the look*) ItS 2:45 in the morning. You mind telling me what it is were supposed to be looking for?  ,5,11
SCULLY: Who?  ,5,11
SCULLY: And you recognize him?  ,5,11
SCULLY: Why have I never heard of him?  ,5,11
SCULLY: I still dont see the connection.  ,5,11
"SCULLY: So, why was Gelman in there?  ",5,11
SCULLY: You think this was a hit on him?  ,5,11
"SCULLY: Mulder, did you take a look at him? Why kill a man who is dying. His body is a bag of bones.  ",5,11
"SCULLY: (shocked) Mulder, thats evidence.  ",5,11
SCULLY: Is that why he disappeared?  ,5,11
"SCULLY: (dryly) ""Twilight Time.""  ",5,11
"SCULLY: (coming over) Anyone ùh, think to check his e-mail.  ",5,11
"SCULLY: ""Invisigoth?""  ",5,11
SCULLY: There must be a thousand containers here. .... and in no particular order.  ,5,11
SCULLY: If not in their computer security.  ,5,11
SCULLY: Mulder!  ,5,11
SCULLY: Stop! FBI!  ,5,11
"SCULLY: FBI! Stop, or Ill shoot! (Fires warning shot over womans head.)  ",5,11
SCULLY: Thank you. (cuffs the woman)  ,5,11
SCULLY: Why dont you let us ask the questions.  ,5,11
SCULLY: Like what youre doing here and what all this stuff is.  ,5,11
"SCULLY: You just committed felony assault on a federal agent, followed by resisting arrest.  ",5,11
SCULLY: What is?  ,5,11
SCULLY: (stopping her) A weapons platform?  ,5,11
SCULLY: You want us to believe that the Department of Defense wants to kill you?  ,5,11
SCULLY: Youre out of your mind.  ,5,11
"SCULLY: Mulder, this is absurd!  ",5,11
SCULLY: Mulder!  ,5,11
SCULLY: (driving) No more screwing around. We need a name. Your real name.  ,5,11
"SCULLY: ""Urschleim in silicon?""  ",5,11
SCULLY: And what was your role in all this? Were you the bass player?  ,5,11
SCULLY: A better offer to do what?  ,5,11
SCULLY: Jeez...  ,5,11
SCULLY: You believe this load of crap?  ,5,11
"SCULLY: She could have rigged an explosive charge. There are no weapons platforms, there is no such Department of Defense satellite.  ",5,11
"SCULLY: They were never built! We dont even have that kind of technology. I mean, even if an artificial intelligence was targeting us, with an armed satellite, why isnt it doing it right now?  ",5,11
SCULLY: How?  ,5,11
"SCULLY: (expression says ""Yeah, right."")  ",5,11
SCULLY: Your name is Esther Nairn?  ,5,11
"SCULLY: Arent you worried its going to track you, Esther? Hunt you down with another particle beam?  ",5,11
"SCULLY: Why didnt it just zap him, too?  ",5,11
SCULLY: Unlike a dozen crack dealers.  ,5,11
"SCULLY: Why dont you just call him. (They all look at SCULLY.) Oh, right  death from above.  ",5,11
SCULLY: T3?  ,5,11
SCULLY: (on phone) Yep.  ,5,11
SCULLY: (on phone) Dandy.  ,5,11
"SCULLY: (on phone) You are correct, sir.  ",5,11
SCULLY: (on phone) In a manner of speaking.  ,5,11
SCULLY: About you and who.  ,5,11
SCULLY: What plans did he find out?  ,5,11
SCULLY: So you were going to   ,5,11
SCULLY: But Donald Gelman forbade it.  ,5,11
"SCULLY: Well, maybe he wasnt here when this happened. Maybe hes somewhere else.  ",5,11
SCULLY: I cant get through to Mulder. (tries number again)  ,5,11
SCULLY: It can interfere with my phone?  ,5,11
SCULLY: Wait a minute. Mulder said that he found the system. In an abandoned chicken farm in Fairfax county.  ,5,11
SCULLY: You can do that?  ,5,11
SCULLY: Esther ... (they get out of the car) Get away from the tanker truck!  ,5,11
"SCULLY: (to driver) Sir? You need to get out of the truck. Move it! Its going to explode. (He does. SCULLY runs toward ESTHER who still holds computer and is looking skyward from center of bridge.) Dump it, Esther! Get rid of it!  ",5,11
"SCULLY: Esther! Dump it! (jumps onto bridge at the last minute) Esther! Get rid of it! (ESTHER desperately typing.) Get rid of it , Esther!  ",5,11
"SCULLY: Mulder, these women are spies!  ",5,11
"SCULLY: Mulder, they want the Kill Switch virus. What did you tell her?  ",5,11
SCULLY: I need to know!  ,5,11
"SCULLY: Do we have it? (MULDER looks at her, hurt, wanting comfort) Do we have the Kill Switch?  ",5,11
"SCULLY: Mulder?! Mulder, are you all right?  ",5,11
"SCULLY: Mulder? (AI perspective of SCULLY and ESTHER) Mulder. Mulder, can you hear me? (SCULLY sticks her head through floor hatchway.) Mulder?  ",5,11
"SCULLY: (looking around at wires and machinery) Mulder? Help me out here, Esther. Whats its next move? What is it thinking?  ",5,11
SCULLY: Who built this?  ,5,11
"SCULLY: Mulder? (ESTHER shines flashlight on MULDER.) Mulder? (lifts visor up exposing MULDERS staring eyes, being held open by clamps.) Mulder, can you hear me? (MULDER tries to move his mouth.) Mulder, talk to me.  ",5,11
"SCULLY: Well, we dont have it. You threw it in the water with the computer.  ",5,11
"SCULLY: Thats going to kill it, right?  ",5,11
"SCULLY: Give it what it wants, Esther. (MULDER jolted again.) Put it in, Esther.  ",5,11
SCULLY: Put it in!  ,5,11
SCULLY: Youre going to be okay. Im going to get you out of here.  ,5,11
SCULLY: Okay. Its okay.  ,5,11
"SCULLY: What are you doing, Esther?  ",5,11
SCULLY: What are you doing?  ,5,11
SCULLY: Esther?!  ,5,11
SCULLY: Where are you?  ,5,11
"SCULLY: Well, if Esther wanted to leave her body, she got her wish. At least that part of it.  ",5,11
"SCULLY: Mulder, shes dead.  ",5,11
"SCULLY: (voice) Mulder, are you telling me that Esther may have ... that she may not be dead?  ",5,11
"SCULLY: (voice) Electrons chasing each other through a circuit --- that isnt life, Mulder.  ",5,11
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,5,12
SCULLY: Mulder--  ,5,12
SCULLY: Skinner wants our report in one hour. What are you going to tell him?  ,5,12
SCULLY: I'll tell him exactly what I saw.  ,5,12
"SCULLY: First of all, if the family of Ronnie Strickland does indeed decide to sue the FBI for -- I think the figure is $446 million -- then you and I both will most certainly be co-defendants and second of all ... I don't even have a second of all, Mulder. $446 million. I'm in this as deep as you are and I'm not even the one that overreacted. I didn't do the ... (She makes a stabbing motion) with the thing.  ",5,12
SCULLY: Where is your proof?  ,5,12
"SCULLY: Oh, you want our stories straight.  ",5,12
SCULLY: I don't feel comfortable with that.  ,5,12
SCULLY: All right.  ,5,12
"SCULLY: The very beginning? (Mulder returns to his desk and takes a micro tape recorder from the drawer and turns it on.) Fine. (she slowly stands up and starts to pace as she talks) Yesterday morning ... when I arrived at work, you were, uh ... characteristically exuberant.  ",5,12
"SCULLY: You want us to go to Dallas? (Mulder talks through this whole scene rapid fire while Scully is laid back, just give me the facts)  ",5,12
SCULLY: Exsanguinations? Of whom?  ,5,12
SCULLY: Is it a...?  ,5,12
SCULLY: Is there any sign of --?  ,5,12
SCULLY: I wasn't asking that.  ,5,12
"SCULLY: Well, these may be syringe marks. Their placement meant to emulate fangs. Such ritualistic blood-letting points towards cultists of some sort, in which case ... (She notices a look of bemusement on Mulder's face) What? (He laughs)  ",5,12
SCULLY: You're not gonna tell me you think it's that Mexican goat sucker thing.  ,5,12
"SCULLY: So, instead, this would be...  ",5,12
SCULLY: Of a bunch of cows.  ,5,12
SCULLY: Why the hell didn't you tell me that from the beginning?  ,5,12
"SCULLY: The town of Chaney is too small to maintain a morgue facility. As such, we made our way to the Peaceful Slumbers funeral home in order to examine the body of one Mr. Dwight Funt, recently deceased.  ",5,12
SCULLY: No exam has been done?  ,5,12
"SCULLY: Well, my theory has evolved. Basically, I think that we're looking for someone who has seen one too many Bela Lugosi movies. He believes he is a vampire, therefore...  ",5,12
"SCULLY: Well, someone so obsessed might well file down their incisors. I think that a moulage casting should help us make an identification.  ",5,12
"SCULLY: Well, there is a psychological fixation called hematodipsia which causes the sufferer to gain erotic satisfaction from consuming human blood.  ",5,12
"SCULLY: Mmm. There are also genetic afflictions which cause a heightened sensitivity to light, uh, to garlic -- porphyria, xeroderma pigmentosum.  ",5,12
SCULLY: You're gonna interrupt me or what?  ,5,12
SCULLY: Anyway ... that's when you had your big ... breakthrough ... whatever.  ,5,12
"SCULLY: Mulder, what's your point?  ",5,12
SCULLY: Mulder ...  ,5,12
"SCULLY: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What am I even looking for? (She walks to Mulder, who puts his hands on her shoulders and pulls her close)  ",5,12
SCULLY: He does that.  ,5,12
"SCULLY: 4:54 PM, begin autopsy on white male, age 60, who is arguably having a worse time in Texas than I am ... although not by much. (She holds a scalpel in her hand) I'll begin with the ""y"" incision. (The blade falls to the floor) Yee-haw. (very unenthusiastically)  ",5,12
"SCULLY: Heart weighs 370 grams, tissue appears healthy. (She plunks a lung into the tray and looks at the readout) Left lung weighs 345 grams, tissue appears healthy. (She plops large intestines in the tray, it slops around over the edges and she pushes it back on the tray, looks at the readout) Large intestine ... 890 grams, yada yada yada.  ",5,12
"SCULLY: Stomach contents show last meal close to the time of death, consisting of ... pizza. Topped with pepperoni, green peppers, mushrooms ... mushrooms ... That sounds really good. (She works the kinks out of her neck and continues)  ",5,12
SCULLY: Having completed the autopsy I checked into the Davey Crockett Motor Court.  ,5,12
SCULLY: Chloral hydrate.  ,5,12
SCULLY: What the hell happened to you? (She sits up on the bed. The whole front of his jacket and pants is full of mud)  ,5,12
"SCULLY: Yeah. That thing that you didn't know that you were looking for -- chloral hydrate -- more colorfully known as knockout drops. I found it in abundance when I sent the tox screen in on our murder victim. Now, seriously, Mulder. What happened to you?  ",5,12
"SCULLY: My ... (She makes her fingers into quotation marks) ""theory?"" Your vampire. He found it necessary to dope poor Mr. Funt to the gills before he was able to extract his blood ... Probably did it to the cows, too.  ",5,12
SCULLY: Exactly.  ,5,12
SCULLY: Tonight? I just put money in the magic fingers!  ,5,12
"SCULLY: This one's my room, Mulder. Don't get mud everywhere.  ",5,12
SCULLY: Yeah. The guy in there'll pay for it. (She walks to the car as the delivery boy turns and we see it's the teen from the beginning of the show)  ,5,12
"SCULLY: Foregoing both dinner and sleep, I was soon back at the funeral home examining one Mr. Paul Lombardo from Naples ... (She slaps the objects in the tray this time) Florida. Heart ... lung... large intestine. (The large intestines slop out of the tray and to the floor, she just watches, not caring and obviously tired and put out. She has really bad neck problems as she works the kinks out as she talks slowly) As with the previous victim, it appears that the subject was most likely incapacitated with chloral hydrate, and then exsanguinated. (Her cell phone rings) The drug was either injected or ingested. I'm not sure which. (Phone rings again. She answers it) Scully. (She only hears breathing) Hello? Hello? (She hangs up, sighs, then puts on new latex gloves) Where was I? Stomach contents. (She hunches over the corpse) Stomach contents include ... pizza ... (She gasps) Chloral hydrate's in the pizza. The pizza guy. (Gasps again) Mulder!  ",5,12
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,5,12
"SCULLY: Well, luckily, I'd gotten there in time. I mean, though you were drugged, you were ... more or less unharmed.  ",5,12
SCULLY: Mulder? Are you okay? (She turns his face to her and softly slaps it to wake him up. He wakes up and sings)  ,5,12
"SCULLY: Long story short. Though my first four shots obviously missed Ronnie Strickland entirely, with my fifth I was able to shoot out a tire on his car, forcing him to escape on foot. I left you behind and I entered the woods in pursuit. I assumed that you were incapacitated. Then I heard screaming. When I arrived in the clearing, I found that you had caught up with him first and had ... over reacted. And that his vampire teeth were fake.  ",5,12
"SCULLY: Well, I'm going to argue that we caught a killer -- an utterly non-supernatural killer, but a killer nonetheless. And that your zeal to catch up with him was augmented by the chloral hydrate you were given.  ",5,12
SCULLY: Excuse me?  ,5,12
SCULLY: Mulder? (She looks at the 'idiot') Why don't you tell me the way you think it happened? Starting at the beginning.  ,5,12
SCULLY: Why are we going to Dallas?  ,5,12
SCULLY: Like what?  ,5,12
SCULLY: It's a dead cow.  ,5,12
SCULLY: Why am I looking at six dead cows?  ,5,12
SCULLY: And?  ,5,12
SCULLY: On what do you base that?!  ,5,12
"SCULLY: Well, it's obviously not a vampire.  ",5,12
SCULLY: Because they don't exist?  ,5,12
"SCULLY: It's not that Mexican goat sucker, either.  ",5,12
"SCULLY: Hoo, boy.  ",5,12
SCULLY: He had big buck teeth?  ,5,12
"SCULLY: No, he didn't. (Mulder shrugs) And that's significant? How?  ",5,12
"SCULLY: (Dreamily gazing at the sheriff, repeats) No exam has been done?  ",5,12
"SCULLY: In short, Sheriff, no. This can't be what it looks like. I think what we're dealing with here is simply a case of some lunatic. (She chuckles) Who, uh, has watched too many Bela Lugosi movies. He wishes that he could transfigure himself into a creature of the night.  ",5,12
SCULLY: (sarcastically) Thank you.  ,5,12
"SCULLY: If there's a point, Mulder, please feel free to come to it.  ",5,12
"SCULLY: Now, why is it so important that his shoes were untied?  ",5,12
"SCULLY: Mulder, shoelaces?  ",5,12
SCULLY: On the corpse. You were going to tell me what was meaningful about finding untied shoelaces.  ,5,12
"SCULLY: Why skip ahead? What happened then? (silence) Mulder? You shot out the tires, and what then?  ",5,12
"SCULLY: What do you mean you want me to do another autopsy?! (Scully is sitting on the side of the vibrating bed, screaming and talking fast, her voice vibrating ) And why do I have to do it right now?! I just spent hours on my feet doing an autopsy, all for you. I do it all for you, Mulder. You know, I haven't eaten since 6:00 this morning, and all that was, was a half a cream cheese bagel, and it wasn't even real cream cheese, it was light cream cheese. And now you want me to run off and do another autopsy? (She notices the mud) What the hell happened to you? (Scully gets up and walks to the door)  ",5,12
SCULLY: Don't you touch that bed.  ,5,12
"SCULLY (on the phone): Scully. Hello? (Mulder just groans) Hello? (he sees Ronnie's shadow at the window, then he walks in the door) ... Creep. (She hangs up. Ronnie comes in. Mulder throws the phone at him and falls on the floor. Ronnie moves closer. His eyes are glow in the dark green. He hisses, and he has fangs. Mulder's hand reaches up to the night stand and grabs some sunflower seeds and throws them at Ronnie)  ",5,12
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,5,12
SCULLY: You're saying that I actually hit him two times?  ,5,12
SCULLY: And then he sort of flew at me like a flying squirrel?  ,5,12
"SCULLY: Mulder, it's not just me. Nobody in their right mind will ever believe that story.  ",5,12
"SCULLY: Mulder, please just keep reminding him you were drugged.  ",5,12
SCULLY: It wouldn't hurt.  ,5,12
SCULLY: But ... he was dead.  ,5,12
SCULLY: With a stake through his heart.  ,5,12
SCULLY: So we should find Ronnie out here because ...?  ,5,12
SCULLY: Oh.  ,5,12
"SCULLY: But Mulder, he had fake fangs. Why would a real vampire need fake fangs? I mean, for the sake of argument.  ",5,12
"SCULLY: Well, so where the hell is he?  ",5,12
"SCULLY: Well, an aunt and an uncle. Their mail comes general delivery to a local post office.  ",5,12
SCULLY: Sheriff Hartwell. (Sheriff gets out of the car)  ,5,12
SCULLY: Where are you going?  ,5,12
SCULLY: Thanks.  ,5,12
SCULLY: You mean aside from the fact that I don't believe in them?  ,5,12
"SCULLY: Well ... they're supposed to be extremely charming. Seductive. (She drinks) No, I mean ... even if they did really exist, who's to say they'd actually be like that? As Agent Mulder says, there are many different kinds of vampires.  ",5,12
SCULLY: Mulder? (Scully's wearing the sheriff's coat)  ,5,12
SCULLY: I came to in the cemetery. That's all I know.  ,5,12
"SCULLY: Well, I can neither confirm nor deny agent Mulder's version of events which occurred outside my presence.  ",5,12
SCULLY: Anyway... I was drugged.  ,5,12
SCULLY: Essentially.  ,5,12
"SCULLY: Is there something I can help you with, Agent Spender?  ",5,13
SCULLY: About what?  ,5,13
SCULLY: You're going to tell me who this is?  ,5,13
SCULLY: Your mother?  ,5,13
SCULLY: Is this part of a case?  ,5,13
SCULLY: Then why is he talking to her?  ,5,13
SCULLY: I think I understand.  ,5,13
SCULLY: Shouldn't that be my picture next to the headline?  ,5,13
SCULLY: Or is that just you having a little fun?  ,5,13
"SCULLY: You look constipated, actually.  ",5,13
SCULLY: This wouldn't have anything to do with Cassandra Spender?  ,5,13
SCULLY: How's that?  ,5,13
SCULLY: Well ... I guess I'm done here. You seem to have invalidated your own work. Have a nice life.  ,5,13
SCULLY: Her son accosted me in the hallway. He's an FBI agent.  ,5,13
"SCULLY: He's of the same opinion as you, by the way - that she's not well.  ",5,13
"SCULLY: You've come a long way, Mulder.  ",5,13
SCULLY: Cassandra Spender was abducted at Skyland Mountain. That's where I was taken ... where Duane Barry took me.  ,5,13
SCULLY: It says here that she has an implant ... in the base of her neck.  ,5,13
"SCULLY: Oh, no, he, uh, he asked if you'd please not talk about this with anyone.  ",5,13
SCULLY: Cassandra? Miss Spender?  ,5,13
SCULLY: I don't think so.  ,5,13
"SCULLY: Uh, yes, but not a practising one.  ",5,13
"SCULLY: My name is Dana Scully and, uh, I'd like to ask you some questions.  ",5,13
"SCULLY: May I? Um ... I think you should know that I, uh ... I learned about you from your son.  ",5,13
SCULLY: Yes. I'm an FBI agent and he asked that I protect against your story getting out.  ,5,13
"SCULLY: I guess I'm betraying that by coming here. But, um ... but I - I don't ... I'm here for more personal reasons, actually. I took the liberty of reading your medical file.  ",5,13
SCULLY: That's not why I'm here.  ,5,13
"SCULLY: I'm here because I, uh ... because ... I wanted to tell you that you should ... that you should not remove the thing that you have in your neck. Not without possible consequences. Um ... I became very ill.  ",5,13
SCULLY: No. Not as of this moment.  ,5,13
SCULLY: They've all been burned and there are plenty more who are still being bagged as we speak.  ,5,13
"SCULLY: Well, it appears they all came by car. Most of the dead are congregated in a wooded area a short distance off the road.  ",5,13
"SCULLY: There's no evidence of that right now. There's no accelerants, no incindiary device.  ",5,13
"SCULLY: There's no way to ID their bodies right now. It's going to be a painstaking dental process. Mulder, why are you tiptoeing around the obvious fact here? I mean, this is Skyland Mountain. We're right back here on Skyland Mountain.  ",5,13
"SCULLY: Well, you can't deny the connection.  ",5,13
SCULLY: No ... I'm not saying that.  ,5,13
SCULLY: What do you mean by evidence?  ,5,13
"SCULLY: Well, are you going to give me your theory, then?  ",5,13
SCULLY: Cassandra? You called us?  ,5,13
SCULLY: Friends from where?  ,5,13
SCULLY: Your mother called us about the incident in Virginia. She said that she knew some of the dead.  ,5,13
SCULLY: She was in a cult?  ,5,13
SCULLY: For what?  ,5,13
"SCULLY: ""Major depressive disorder characterized by periods of sustained anxiety and paranoia. Patient believes he will be contacted or called to an undisclosed place where he will be abducted by aliens.""  ",5,13
SCULLY: By whom?  ,5,13
"SCULLY: Mulder, that doesn't make sense.  ",5,13
SCULLY: But they weren't abducted. They were led to their deaths. And for what purpose?  ,5,13
"SCULLY: Now, Mulder ...  ",5,13
SCULLY: Maybe you shouldn't be so quick to rule out what Cassandra Spender has to say.  ,5,13
SCULLY: Mmmmm ... what time is it?  ,5,14
SCULLY: Why are you laughing?  ,5,14
"SCULLY: Mulder, what am I doing here?  ",5,14
SCULLY: From what?  ,5,14
SCULLY: From what?  ,5,14
SCULLY: Mulder ...  ,5,14
SCULLY: I was there?  ,5,14
SCULLY: Doing what?  ,5,14
"SCULLY: Well, Mulder ...  ",5,14
"SCULLY: I don't know what to say. I mean, I - I don't have the first clue. There's nothing here.  ",5,14
"SCULLY: Mulder, I have never been here. I couldn't tell you how to get here, let alone drive it.  ",5,14
"SCULLY: She was there, too?  ",5,14
SCULLY: You found more implants?  ,5,14
"SCULLY: Yeah, but it wouldn't explain why they would want to kill me. And it doesn't explain why I survived.  ",5,14
"SCULLY: Mulder, when I met you five years ago, you told me that your sister had been abducted ... by aliens. That that event had marked you so deeply, that nothing else mattered. I didn't believe you, but I followed you, on nothing more than your faith that the truth was out there, based not on facts, not on science, but on your memories that your sister had been taken from you. Your memories were all that you had.  ",5,14
"SCULLY: Well, whether you trust them or not, they've led you here. And me. But I have no memories to either trust nor distrust, and if you ask me now to follow you again, to stand behind you in what you now believe, without knowing what happened to me out there, without those memories, I can't. I won't.  ",5,14
SCULLY: Is that what you really want?  ,5,14
SCULLY: I'm okay.  ,5,14
"SCULLY: Uh, once ... but I have to be honest with you, I didn't have much luck.  ",5,14
SCULLY (V.O.): I don't think this is working.  ,5,14
"SCULLY: Oh, my God!  ",5,14
"SCULLY: Oh, my God! Oh, my God!  ",5,14
"SCULLY: Oh ... I'm, uh ... I'm with the others.  ",5,14
SCULLY: Yes.  ,5,14
"SCULLY: And then ... and then it was gone. Oh, oh!  ",5,14
"SCULLY: It's, uh ... they're back.  ",5,14
"SCULLY: Oh, they're ... they're on fire!  ",5,14
SCULLY: They're setting them on fire. I can't ...  ,5,14
"SCULLY: Their faces, I ... they have no faces. I ... they have no eyes. Oh, God! They're coming at us!  ",5,14
SCULLY: They're surrounding us! They won't stop! They won't stop! There's ... there's another one. There's another ship.  ,5,14
SCULLY: They see it. They were attacking them.  ,5,14
"SCULLY: The ... the faceless men. They're ... oh, my God, I can't -  ",5,14
"SCULLY: No. Now it's coming at us. Oh, my God! No! Cassandra!  ",5,14
"SCULLY: They're ... they're taking her. They're ... oh, my God.  ",5,14
SCULLY: I can't ...  ,5,14
SCULLY: No. I ...  ,5,14
SCULLY: Okay.  ,5,14
SCULLY: You've been here the whole time?  ,5,14
"SCULLY: No, sir. Neither was I.  ",5,14
"SCULLY: I've listened to the tape several times, and I don't have a clear recollection of what I hear myself saying, but I also don't see any reason why I'd be saying it.  ",5,14
"SCULLY: Well, we - we don't know anything more.  ",5,14
SCULLY: Did he say why?  ,5,14
"SCULLY: No, actually, Agent Mulder hasn't.  ",5,14
SCULLY: I thought you were here about your mother.  ,5,14
SCULLY: We talked about how she was feeling. We talked about a lot of things.  ,5,14
SCULLY: In what way?  ,5,14
SCULLY: Is that what you were afraid people would find out?  ,5,14
SCULLY: I don't understand.  ,5,14
SCULLY: She told you to say those things?  ,5,14
SCULLY: For what?  ,5,14
"SCULLY: Why are you here, Agent Spender? Why did you show this to me?  ",5,14
SCULLY: I think that Dr. Werber would beg to differ.  ,5,14
"SCULLY: I appreciate your opinion, agent Spender, but I don't have a mother feeding me abduction stories.  ",5,14
SCULLY: Mulder? What are you doing sitting here in the dark?  ,5,14
SCULLY: Thinking about what?  ,5,14
"SCULLY: Well, I've just taken a long walk and I've reconsidered that I may have been wrong about what I believed happened to me.  ",5,14
SCULLY: What is this?  ,5,14
"SCULLY: Mulder, he's armed and well within his jurisdiction.  ",5,14
SCULLY: I know this man.  ,5,14
SCULLY: That driver. I know his face.  ,5,14
SCULLY: What happened?  ,5,14
SCULLY: The deceased is Paco Ordonez aka Little Monster. Street dealer. Liked to use grade school kids as couriers. Out on bail for possession with intent. Two-time loser looking at life.  ,5,16
SCULLY: The killer carved a single C-shaped cut up through the right kidney. Fatal blood loss came in under 30 seconds.  ,5,16
"SCULLY: Her juvenile records are sealed, but Detective Pennock has it on authority that two of them were drug busts  possession, and possession with intent.  ",5,16
"SCULLY: Ms. Glenn took a $60 cab ride alone straight to the motel. The cabbie instructed her to room 10, which she asked for specifically, and then told him to get lost. 30 minutes later, dead heroin dealer.  ",5,16
"SCULLY: Uh, Special Agent Scully. Wed like to ask you some questions, Marty.  ",5,16
SCULLY: Im curious why youve refused your right to an attorney.  ,5,16
"SCULLY: Well, you could be charged right now .. for the fact that youve given no compelling reason why you were in that motel room. What were you doing there, Marty?  ",5,16
"SCULLY: (after look to MULDER) The cabbie has given a statement that you asked specifically for room 10, which would put you at the murder scene right about the time of death.  ",5,16
SCULLY: If you were involved in any way.  ,5,16
SCULLY: Did you intend to buy drugs from Paco Ordonez?  ,5,16
SCULLY: Did you kill him?  ,5,16
"SCULLY: She wouldnt explain her presence in the crime scene, and she avoided all discussion about the murder weapon.  ",5,16
"SCULLY: Detective, did you snake all of the plumbing in the bathroom?  ",5,16
"SCULLY: Well, if we find the weapon with her fingerprints on it, shes as good as convicted. Short of that, she's gonna walk.  ",5,16
SCULLY: (looking to MULDER) Okay.  ,5,16
SCULLY: (on phone) Scully.  ,5,16
"SCULLY: (on phone, voice) About what?  ",5,16
"SCULLY: (on phone, voice) How do you know that she knew him?  ",5,16
SCULLY: (on phone) Would you like me to remind you why polygraphs are inadmissible in court?  ,5,16
"SCULLY: (on phone) Well, maybe she was, Mulder, but dont make me state the obvious. She didnt see anything.  ",5,16
"SCULLY: (on phone) Well, how else did she see? Bat vision?  ",5,16
"SCULLY: (on phone, looking at razor disposal slot in bathroom) Well, Mulder, when you figure it out, give me a call. (hangs up)  ",5,16
SCULLY: Detective Pennock.  ,5,16
SCULLY: They were found at the crime scene with blood all over them. We believe they were worn by Paco Ordonezs killer.  ,5,16
"SCULLY: Your prints are already all over them, Marty.  ",5,16
SCULLY: Hope you saw what just happened in there.  ,5,16
"SCULLY: I think its arrogance, Mulder. I think its the same reason why she agreed to take the polygraph test. She knows that the prejudices in this case are all in her favor.  ",5,16
"SCULLY: So, you think that it was pride that made her ditch the bloody gloves? Her prints were all over them, Mulder. Why would she do that.  ",5,16
"SCULLY: Okay, so - so by your reasoning, the killer took off with the murder weapon, but not the gloves leaving Marty to come in, go straight to the gloves, and hide them in the one place that nobody would easily think to find them.  ",5,16
"SCULLY: Well, wait a minute. Maybe its much simpler than that.  ",5,16
"SCULLY: What if shes not really blind? I mean, she hasnt applied for any of her - her disability benefits. Maybe thats because she knows that she couldnt pass the medical screening.  ",5,16
"SCULLY: No, no. But - but possibly its a - a conversion disorder, or a - a form of blindsight. A - a split consciousness whereby a person has a certain level of visual ability but theyre not aware that theyre actually seeing. Its worth checking out.  ",5,16
SCULLY: Theres no way that she could fool the machine?  ,5,16
SCULLY: But she is still our best and only suspect.  ,5,16
SCULLY: Want to hear the latest?  ,5,16
"SCULLY: Detective Pennock ran the gloves for blood typing and found two different samples, one type matching Marty Glenns.  ",5,16
"SCULLY: Yeah, well, all the same Im going to hand deliver them to the lab in Washington, expedite a PCR to see if shes a match.  ",5,16
SCULLY: Ill let you know as soon as I get the tests back. (leaves)  ,5,16
"SCULLY: (walking down hallway in DC, on phone) Mulder.  ",5,16
"SCULLY: (on phone) Ive got the PCR results on the two blood types from the gloves. Neither was Martys. You were right, Mulder. She didnt do it.  ",5,16
SCULLY: She told you hed be in there?  ,5,16
SCULLY: What made her decide to cooperate?  ,5,16
"SCULLY: All of a sudden? I mean, if shes so anxious to stop him, why didnt she tell us his name before now?  ",5,16
"SCULLY: Well, yet, according to you, shes been seeing through his eyes the whole time.  ",5,16
SCULLY: When the murders started.  ,5,16
"SCULLY: Well, if all this is true, let's go get him. (Starts for bar. MULDER doesnt follow.) Mulder?  ",5,16
SCULLY: How did you know he wouldnt be in there?  ,5,16
SCULLY: Shes still protecting him?  ,5,16
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,5,16
SCULLY: Mulder...  ,5,16
"SCULLY: Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been several months since my last confession.  ",5,17
"SCULLY: Father, Im an FBI agent. Ive taken it as my code and purpose to uphold the law  to save lives.  ",5,17
SCULLY: In a way. I was here for Easter services last week and Father McCue approached me for my help.  ,5,17
"SCULLY: Because there was a family that he felt needed my help. But it was more than that. Father, I had a daughter who died  A strange and sudden death several months ago.  ",5,17
SCULLY: Yes.  ,5,17
"SCULLY: (crying) Father, I told you that I had a sin to confess  But the sin of which Im guilty  Im not sure if you can offer forgiveness.  ",5,17
"SCULLY: An innocent girl is dead because of me. I couldve saved her life, but I let her die.  ",5,17
SCULLY: Ive been trying to make an effort to come more often.  ,5,17
"SCULLY: No, Im afraid I dont.  ",5,17
"SCULLY: No, I didnt.  ",5,17
SCULLY: Are you asking for my help?  ,5,17
"SCULLY: Oh, Father McCue said that, uh, that youve been having trouble getting much information about what might have happened to her.  ",5,17
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,5,17
SCULLY: Could somebody have taken her out of her room?  ,5,17
"SCULLY: Mrs. Kernof was talking about her husband, but she might as well have been talking about me.  ",5,17
"SCULLY: I felt drawn to these people, Father  in a very personal way. I was determined to help them understand why their daughter had been taken.  ",5,17
"SCULLY: As much as I have my faith, Father, I am a scientist trained to weigh evidence but science only teaches us how  not why.  ",5,17
SCULLY: You think it was lightning?  ,5,17
SCULLY: Her mother said that she was found in a kneeling position.  ,5,17
SCULLY: Why do you ask?  ,5,17
SCULLY: Looks like there was surgery done on her hands.  ,5,17
SCULLY: Whats the connection?  ,5,17
SCULLY: Dara Kernof was adopted. I dont suppose that youve requested any information about the birth mother.  ,5,17
"SCULLY: No, thats okay. I, uh  I have someone I can ask. Somebody Id like to confer with, actually.  ",5,17
SCULLY: (on phone) Hello?  ,5,17
"SCULLY: (on phone) Hi .. uh, somethings come up. I was, uh, hoping that you could do me a favor.  ",5,17
SCULLY: (on phone) This isnt official FBI business so I was hoping that we could keep it outside of work.  ,5,17
SCULLY: (on phone) I need some birth and adoptive records on a Dara Kernof.  ,5,17
"SCULLY: (on phone) Dara Kernof. I cant tell you much more than that, Mulder. Im sorry.  ",5,17
SCULLY: (on phone) Not until you get me those records.  ,5,17
SCULLY: What so you mean?  ,5,17
"SCULLY: Mulder, its not what you think. I - I didnt want to involve you. I got asked to look into this as a favor for a family.  ",5,17
SCULLY: You found Daras records?  ,5,17
SCULLY: I think one of my questions has already been answered. Dara was a twin.  ,5,17
"SCULLY: Uh, yes, as far as I know. Why?  ",5,17
SCULLY: Put there by whom?  ,5,17
SCULLY: Not as of this time.  ,5,17
"SCULLY: Uh, its doubtful. Paula Koklos was severely impaired -- physically and mentally  as was Dara Kernof.  ",5,17
SCULLY: It appears that their eyes were burnt out. Their bodies frozen in a position of prayer.  ,5,17
SCULLY: They might.  ,5,17
SCULLY: What makes you so sure?  ,5,17
"SCULLY: Mr. Starkey, do you happen to know if that cross over there belonged to Paula?  ",5,17
SCULLY: Did she have any visitors or anybody who might have left it behind?  ,5,17
SCULLY: By who?  ,5,17
SCULLY: What kind of church is this?  ,5,17
SCULLY: Father Gregory?  ,5,17
SCULLY: Im Dana Scully. Were here about the death of Paula Koklos.  ,5,17
"SCULLY: Are you all right, Father?  ",5,17
SCULLY: Do you know where she is?  ,5,17
SCULLY: We were looking for her name. Its not listed on the girls birth records.  ,5,17
SCULLY: The other two girls may be in danger. Were hoping that she might be able to help is find them.  ,5,17
SCULLY: Can you give us a name?  ,5,17
"SCULLY: I brought Agent Mulder on the case to help temper my feelings  to keep them from clouding my judgement. I wouldnt admit it to him, but  as we stood there, I felt as if Father Gregory were speaking directly to me  in a language only I could understand.  ",5,17
SCULLY: Yes.  ,5,17
"SCULLY: I think youre a little extreme in your judgment, dont you, Mulder?  ",5,17
"SCULLY: Well, he said this wasnt done by the hand of man. Do you think he believes that, too?  ",5,17
SCULLY: What?  ,5,17
"SCULLY: But, basically, youre ruling out any element of the supernatural?  ",5,17
"SCULLY: Well, Dara Kernof was baptized on the day of her death. She was sanctified by the ritual sacrament  submerged in the spirit..  ",5,17
"SCULLY: I was raised to believe that God has His reasons, however mysterious.  ",5,17
"SCULLY: The victim is Paula Koklos, age 16, cause of death unknown. Ill begin with the external examination. (Pulls back sheet to show PAULAS burned eyes. PAULA has six fingers on each hand) Victim has signs of congenital physical defects including four supernumerary digits. The only indications of external trauma are the burning  by means unknown, of both globes of the eyes. (feels a lump on the shoulder) Im noting something on the shoulder  a bony process of some kind, possibly a tumerous mass. No- no indication of surgical procedure. (looks at x-ray) The mass appears on both the right and left clavicle.  ",5,17
"SCULLY: (quietly) Oh, God. (turns away)  ",5,17
SCULLY: I told myself that it was all in my head  a hallucination brought on by my emotional connection to the case.  ,5,17
"SCULLY: But thats not what it was, Father. I was meant to see Emily  for a purpose.  ",5,17
SCULLY: To save these girls.  ,5,17
SCULLY: (on phone) What do you mean?  ,5,17
SCULLY: (on phone) Where?  ,5,17
"SCULLY: (on phone) Well, Mulder, if she shares anything with her sisters, she wouldnt be walking anywhere far.  ",5,17
"SCULLY: (on phone) Theres evidence of a progressive degenerative bone disease and, uh, I know youre going to think that Im crazy  but I swear I found evidence of something winglike.  ",5,17
"SCULLY: (on phone, voice) Mulder, theres something else   ",5,17
SCULLY: St. Peter would only be crucified upside-down out of humility towards Christ.  ,5,17
SCULLY: Yes.  ,5,17
SCULLY: He believed that he could find the last girl. But I already knew that I was meant to save her.  ,5,17
SCULLY: I wasnt sure. Father Gregory said that the Devil claimed the lives of the first three girls.  ,5,17
"SCULLY: I know now that Father Gregory was mistaken. The Devil didnt take their souls, but the threat to those girls was real. And Father Gregory gave his life to protect them.  ",5,17
SCULLY: Father Gregory called them Messengers.  ,5,17
"SCULLY: Mulder, he knows where she is.  ",5,17
SCULLY: Youre not going find her. I think youre being misled.  ,5,17
SCULLY: I saw Emily. She came to me in a vision.  ,5,17
SCULLY: You go. Go find the girl. Im going to finish up with Father Gregory.  ,5,17
SCULLY: Id like to get back in here.  ,5,17
SCULLY: Father Gregory? (bangs on door) Father Gregory?  ,5,17
SCULLY: (on phone) Hello?  ,5,17
"SCULLY: (on phone) Hes dead, Mulder.  ",5,17
SCULLY: (on phone) Father Gregory. They found him alone in the interrogation room. No one can figure it out. There was a guard sitting right outside the room.  ,5,17
SCULLY: Father?  ,5,17
"SCULLY: Im not sure if they should be, Father.  ",5,17
SCULLY: Ive seen things. Things that have made me question if there arent  larger forces at work here.  ,5,17
"SCULLY: Visions  of my daughter Emily, for one.  ",5,17
"SCULLY: I considered that, um but then I saw something last night, which I  Which I cant explain. I saw a man  in dark clothes  but he had four faces. They werent human.  ",5,17
SCULLY: How did he bring back their souls?  ,5,17
SCULLY: Do you think thats what I saw?  ,5,17
"SCULLY: But I saw it, Father.  ",5,17
"SCULLY: Father, do you believe that  God has His reasons?  ",5,17
SCULLY: What is it?  ,5,17
SCULLY: Trying to reach me for what?  ,5,17
SCULLY: Theres no one here.  ,5,17
"SCULLY: (to ROBERTA, quietly) My name is Dana. Im going to get you out of there, okay? Im not going to hurt you.  ",5,17
SCULLY: Im going to take you someplace safe.  ,5,17
SCULLY: Everythings going to be fine.  ,5,17
"SCULLY: No, its okay. Its all right. Stay here. Its okay. Stay  Just stay here! Its going to be okay.  ",5,17
SCULLY: Emily.  ,5,17
"SCULLY: Emily? Emily?! Oh, God.  ",5,17
SCULLY: I felt sure of it.  ,5,17
"SCULLY: No. I thought I could, Father, but I cant.  ",5,17
SCULLY: Yes.  ,5,17
"SCULLY: You mean, accepting my loss?  ",5,17
SCULLY: Maybe thats what faith is.  ,5,17
SCULLY: (looking at a bus on monitor) There. The bus.  ,5,18
SCULLY: Whats he looking at?  ,5,18
"SCULLY: Mulder, hes watching you.  ",5,18
SCULLY: What just happened? Whats happening?  ,5,18
SCULLY: I cant see anything! Theres   ,5,18
SCULLY: There he is! Hes heading west. Hes on the move! Hes on the move!  ,5,18
SCULLY: What? What! What? What are you seeing?  ,5,18
SCULLY: What?  ,5,18
SCULLY: Wheres Mulder?  ,5,18
"SCULLY: Mulder, respond!  ",5,18
"SCULLY: I cant see a thing. Mulder, suspect is armed and dangerous. Pursue Alpha with extreme caution.  ",5,18
SCULLY: Mulder! Damn it!  ,5,18
SCULLY: What happened?  ,5,18
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,5,18
"SCULLY: I came in early. I wanted to take a look at the surveillance tape to make sure I wasnt crazy. What happened out there, Mulder?  ",5,18
"SCULLY: There were 12 agents yesterday in the park. We had ownership of the suspect. We were in position to make the capture and you let him get away. And from what I see now, you may have aided in his escape.  ",5,18
"SCULLY: Its on the video, Mulder. I cant prove it was you, but I know what I saw. This man is a murderer. He is a terrorist. I have a report to give this morning. I expect you to give me an answer. I expect you to tell me the truth.  ",5,18
SCULLY: He was killed by means of a highly toxic biological agent.  ,5,18
"SCULLY: We dont know. Its affect on the dermis and the soft tissues, the rapidity of its action  it is not a disease known in nature. It would seem to be genetically engineered. A bioweapon.  ",5,18
SCULLY: Level Four decontamination procedures were undertaken immediately. Our best indications are that exposure was limited and that the toxin was transmitted directly and not contagious.  ,5,18
"SCULLY: At this point, we can only guess that the toxin was transmitted by liquid or gas, touch or injection.  ",5,18
SCULLY: Mulder.  ,5,18
SCULLY: (with attitude rings lobby bell) Maybe you can tell me whats going on.  ,5,18
"SCULLY: There seems to be a problem. A man just told me you gave him keys to my room, room 130.  ",5,18
SCULLY: Who am I? Who is he?  ,5,18
SCULLY: Mr. Kaplan.  ,5,18
SCULLY: Thank you. (starts to exit)  ,5,18
SCULLY: Not even close.  ,5,18
SCULLY: Shi.!  ,5,18
SCULLY: Exactly what agency are you from? Obviously not the Office of Information.  ,5,18
SCULLY: What the hell is going on?  ,5,18
SCULLY: What about my life? I dont appreciate being run off the road.  ,5,18
SCULLY: I dont know what youre talking about.  ,5,18
SCULLY: His true mission?  ,5,18
SCULLY: Why him? Why choose Agent Mulder?  ,5,18
SCULLY: To what aim?  ,5,18
SCULLY: Youve put Agent Mulders life in danger by not telling me.  ,5,18
"SCULLY: Including letting this man Haley get away with murder? Sir, we know nothing about this bioweapon. We dont know what they want to use it for. We dont even know if they have the capacity to store it safely. Putting Agent Mulder in this situation is extremely risky.  ",5,18
SCULLY: What are you reading in there?  ,5,18
SCULLY: (taking kit from the TECH) Thank you.  ,5,18
SCULLY: I dont know. But its going to help us establish a method of delivery. (looks closely at one of the dead patrons whose skin has been dissolved) Its doubtful the pathogen was airborne. They found no atmospheric traces. So its got to be something that everybody touched.  ,5,18
SCULLY: Dont be alarmed.  ,5,18
SCULLY: Mulder   ,5,18
SCULLY: I know what youre doing. Skinner told me everything.  ,5,18
SCULLY: What happened to your hand?  ,5,18
"SCULLY: Oh, Mulder, what did they do to you? God, this needs to be set. Youre in pain.  ",5,18
SCULLY: Lets get the swelling down.  ,5,18
"SCULLY: Theyve killed again, Mulder. 14 people in a movie theatre in Ohio. The same toxin they released in the park.  ",5,18
SCULLY: Unless it was a test for something bigger.  ,5,18
"SCULLY: (voice) Why do this to you, Mulder?  ",5,18
SCULLY: (voice) What stopped him?  ,5,18
SCULLY: Its a bacterium.  ,5,18
SCULLY: Was the bacterium also found on the ticket stub?  ,5,18
"SCULLY: Well, then how was the biotoxin spread throughout the theatre?  ",5,18
SCULLY: It looks like streptococcus.  ,5,18
SCULLY: But strep wouldnt be able to survive any kind of exposure to the environment.  ,5,18
SCULLY: Developed by the Russians?  ,5,18
"SCULLY: Well, then by whom?  ",5,18
"SCULLY: (on phone) The biotoxin was applied to the bearer bond with an aerosol spray, but there is no evidence whatsoever of it on the theatre stubs. Now, I still have no idea how these kids were unaffected.  ",5,18
"SCULLY: (on phone) Sir, are you alone?  ",5,18
SCULLY: (on phone) Id like to speak with you in private.  ,5,18
"SCULLY: (on phone) Thank you. Now, CIA Intelligence suggested that this biotoxin was stolen from the Russians, but my research indicates that it was almost certainly developed domestically.  ",5,18
"SCULLY: (on phone) Yes, sir, thats what weve been told, but the CDC database contains evidence of a streptococcus bacterium being developed by the Armys Pine Bluff Facility in the 1960s. It appears to be a very primitive strain of what were seeing here.  ",5,18
SCULLY: (on phone) What Im saying is that the bioweapons program may have continued in secret and that someone may be sending Agent Mulder on a suicide mission.  ,5,18
"SCULLY: (to herself) Oh, damn. (realization) The money. Oh, my God, the money.  ",5,18
SCULLY: (taped) What stopped him?  ,5,18
"SCULLY: Director Skinner, youve got to get to Mulder. Youve got to find the bank that they hit..  ",5,18
SCULLY: Agent Mulders life is in danger -- and anybody else who touches the currency at that location. Theyre putting the biotoxin on the money.  ,5,18
SCULLY: Youve got no choice.  ,5,18
"SCULLY: Well, hes got to be on there somewhere.  ",5,18
SCULLY: Mulder.  ,5,18
SCULLY: We got here an hour ago before any of the funds were touched or transferred. The cash supply is being isolated. Its being locked down in the vault.  ,5,18
SCULLY: I recognized you from the surveillance tape.  ,5,18
SCULLY: Your finger.  ,5,18
"SCULLY: Mulder, before you go any further you should know that the biotoxin they used may have come from government labs. Our government.  ",5,18
SCULLY: You knew about this all along. You knew about this the whole time!  ,5,18
SCULLY: Sir?  ,5,19
SCULLY: A threat assessment for whom?  ,5,19
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,5,19
"SCULLY: Youre saying ""I"" a lot. I heard ""we."" Nor do I assume that this case is just a waste of our time.  ",5,19
SCULLY: Mulder   ,5,19
"SCULLY: (on phone, voice) Scully.  MULDER: (on phone) Hi. Its me. I need you to check on something.  ",5,19
"SCULLY: (on phone, voice) What?  ",5,19
SCULLY: (on phone) On the case thats a total waste of time?  ,5,19
SCULLY: (on phone) Which one? Theres hundreds.  ,5,19
"SCULLY: (to herself, not overjoyed) ""Hiding in the light."" (gets up to go look for the file)  ",5,19
"SCULLY: (on phone) ""Hiding in the light."" That was a phrase spoken by one Jerrold Resnick to a Lakeland, Florida police investigator on August 9, 1992.  ",5,19
"SCULLY: (on phone) Well, Mr. Resnick was a deacon of his local church and apparently he was concerned that there was an evil presence amongst his fellow parishioners and that he alone was aware of that fact.  ",5,19
"SCULLY: (on phone) Not as such. He showed up for mass one Sunday with four handguns and he began wounding people saying, ""The afflicted ones wouldnt bleed."" He committed suicide a week later in his cell.  ",5,19
SCULLY: (on phone) I told you so.  ,5,19
SCULLY: Whos the agent in charge?  ,5,19
SCULLY: Im Scully. Agent Mulders partner. What can you tell me?  ,5,19
SCULLY: Whos inside?  ,5,19
SCULLY: No. Not until we get a clear idea of the situation.  ,5,19
"SCULLY: If you make a phone call right now, it could compromise Agent Mulder. Sir, we need to find another way.  ",5,19
SCULLY: No. If it was safe to do so he would have called us already.  ,5,19
"SCULLY: (calm, but worried) Who?  ",5,19
SCULLY: Give it to him.  ,5,19
SCULLY: Is he getting this?  ,5,19
SCULLY: (gently) You look exhausted.  ,5,19
SCULLY: Agent Rice has the situation in hand. Lets get you out of here. Mulder?  ,5,19
"SCULLY: Uh, no, Mr. Pincus. Thank you very much for your patience.  ",5,19
SCULLY: (to Mulder) Whats going on?  ,5,19
"SCULLY: Mulder, why didnt you take the day off?  ",5,19
SCULLY: Have you slept?  ,5,19
SCULLY: What exactly is it you think you have here?  ,5,19
"SCULLY: Mulder, youre not serious.  ",5,19
SCULLY: No.  ,5,19
"SCULLY: Well, what youre describing would be more like some kind of a visual agnosia, an inability to recognize whats before ones eyes.  ",5,19
"SCULLY: Mulder, he was disturbed.  ",5,19
SCULLY: He was mentally ill. This monster was a sick fantasy  a product of his dementia.  ,5,19
"SCULLY: (pauses before answering) No. No, I mean, this  this kind of thing is not uncommon. You  you went through a terrible ordeal and sometimes people in close associations under tense conditions, the delusions of one can be passed on to the other.  ",5,19
SCULLY: How?  ,5,19
"SCULLY: No. No, absolutely not.  ",5,19
"SCULLY: Mulder, I am not going to serve the delusions of Gary Lambert, a madman, by giving credence to them.  ",5,19
SCULLY: Mulder   ,5,19
SCULLY: Sir? You wanted to see me?  ,5,19
SCULLY: Sir?  ,5,19
SCULLY: Agent Mulder believes that there may be a connection between the Oak Brook incident and several other cases.  ,5,19
"SCULLY: To the best of my knowledge, Agent Mulder is currently working on a legitimate investigation. I will join him in Illinois immediately.  ",5,19
"SCULLY: Ill get right on it, sir. (starts to leave)  ",5,19
"SCULLY: (looks back at him) No, sir.  ",5,19
"SCULLY: Lets start with the photos. In fact, lets just do photos. External exam only.  ",5,19
SCULLY: Knock yourself out.  ,5,19
"SCULLY: (phone still ringing) Come on, Mulder.  ",5,19
"SCULLY: (turning, surprised) No. This man died late yesterday afternoon.  ",5,19
SCULLY: Absolutely.  ,5,19
SCULLY: More or less what we thought wed find.  ,5,19
"SCULLY: The body showed signs of decomposition beyond what we expected to find which, in and of itself means nothing, really. Time of death is notoriously hard to quantify.  ",5,19
"SCULLY: No, Mulder  ",5,19
"SCULLY: Mulder, the case is over. Theres no more evidence to be gathered. Theres only my hope that youll be able to see past this delusion.  ",5,19
SCULLY: I wish it were that simple.  ,5,19
SCULLY: No. Lets flip him.  ,5,19
SCULLY: Yep. Give me a hand.  ,5,19
"SCULLY: (showing her badge) Ive come a long way, and I know he wants to see me, so what do you say?  ",5,19
"SCULLY: I believe that Agent Mulder is mentally sound and fit for duty. Aside from that belief, I can only present to you the few hard facts that Ive been able to gather. That, as per Agent Mulders assertions a toxin has been found to have been injected into the spine of the shooting victim, Mark Backus. As of yet, weve been unable to identify it. Furthermore, Gregory Pincus has apparently disappeared without a trace along with half a dozen other key witnesses integral to this investigation  among them, Agent Mulders nurse at the hospital and several VinylRight employees.  ",5,19
SCULLY: (sighs) I can personally vouch for the fact that there was an intruder in Agent Mulders hospital room.  ,5,19
SCULLY: (pause) It was dark.  ,5,19
SCULLY: The truth  as well as I under stand it.  ,5,19
SCULLY: Folie A Deux. A madness shared by two.  ,5,19
SCULLY: (quietly) Mulder  what are you doing?  ,5,20
"SCULLY: How long have you been with the Bureau, Agent Fowley?  ",5,20
SCULLY: And they brought you on this because of a terrorism angle?  ,5,20
SCULLY: 1991. (to MULDER) Thats about when you started work on the X-Files.  ,5,20
"SCULLY: (suppressing a smile) Your parents are going to pick you up on Friday, Gibson, to take you back home.  ",5,20
SCULLY: Mulder  (he turns to her) What was that all about?  ,5,20
"SCULLY: Mulder, hes recognized internationally as a prodigy. Hes beaten Grand Masters.  ",5,20
"SCULLY: Mulder, he was goofing on you. He was playing along. Youre positing that this kid can read minds.  ",5,20
"SCULLY: We have seen cases, Mulder, of fakers and lucky guessers but no one that has ever been able to stand up to any kind of rigorous testing. (DIANA comes out of the room and watches MULDER and SCULLY.) No one who has gone so far as to claim that they can zero in on the mind of one person in a crowd of thousands.  ",5,20
SCULLY: Who? Who are you talking about?  ,5,20
"SCULLY: Say that what youre suggesting were even possible, whod want to kill a kid whose abilities would offer you the ultimate advantage  I mean in business, in war, in anything?  ",5,20
"SCULLY: So, you two know each other?  ",5,20
SCULLY: How you doing?  ,5,20
"SCULLY: Hmm  Theyre a little scary, arent they?  ",5,20
SCULLY: About what? About you?  ,5,20
SCULLY: Its amazing. Its hard to believe.  ,5,20
SCULLY: Whered you see that?  ,5,20
"SCULLY: (not looking at DIANA, very tense) I have to disappear for a bit.  ",5,20
SCULLY: (on monitor) Is somebody going to let me in?  ,5,20
SCULLY: Thank you.  ,5,20
SCULLY: I need your help.  ,5,20
SCULLY: Youve all heard of Gibson Praise the chess wunderkind. These are a series of scans and neural electrical outputs of his brain and brain processes. (She places the images of GIBSONs brain on a lighted viewer.) There seems to be some suspicion that hes a fraud.  ,5,20
"SCULLY: Well, apparently, he wins by reading his opponents minds.  ",5,20
SCULLY: Analyze the data  with an eye to the parapsychological.  ,5,20
"SCULLY: (not looking at them, switching off the viewer) First  I want you guys to tell me who Diana Fowley is.  ",5,20
SCULLY: Then you know her.  ,5,20
"SCULLY: Well, she claims to have worked closely with him for a while.  ",5,20
SCULLY: Well  Why dont you boys see what you can find?  ,5,20
"SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, its me.  ",5,20
"SCULLY: (on phone) Im, uh, Im on my way to work. I was hoping I could show you something. Something about the boy.  ",5,20
"SCULLY: (on phone, voice) Uh, no, Id ... Id prefer to show you at work if thats okay.  ",5,20
SCULLY: (on phone) I think youll be surprised. Very surprised.  ,5,20
SCULLY: (uncomfortable with what shes saying) Ive conducted some tests on Gibson Praise and have come up with some rather unexpected conclusions: ones which I myself have difficulty reconciling with what I know.  ,5,20
SCULLY: Neurological tests. Mapping of brain functions using a very high resolution EEG.  ,5,20
"SCULLY: The tests revealed something peculiar in an area of the brain that we are only beginning to understand. An area of the temporal lobe that neurophysicists are calling the ""God nodule.""  ",5,20
"SCULLY: All of the boys brain processes are showing extraordinary activity in exactly this part of the brain. Which is not just abnormal or anomalous, but from what I know absolutely unheard of.  ",5,20
SCULLY: You mischaracterize what Ive said. This would be quantifiable scientific proof of everything Agent Mulder and I have investigated over the past five years.  ,5,20
SCULLY: Gibson?  ,5,20
SCULLY: Id like to ask you something.  ,5,20
SCULLY: How do you do it?  ,5,20
SCULLY: Is that why you like chess? Cause its just one thought that you hear?  ,5,20
SCULLY: Why else do you like it?  ,5,20
SCULLY: (laughs softly) Is that what people do?  ,5,20
SCULLY: Why?  ,5,20
SCULLY: You think I dont care?  ,5,20
"SCULLY: (to GIBSON) Well, well talk about this later, okay?  ",5,20
"SCULLY: (at door) Nobodys going to do anything to you, Gibson. I promise.  ",5,20
SCULLY: What about the boy? Is he here?  ,5,20
SCULLY: (on phone) We knew there were risks going to the Attorney General.  ,5,20
"SCULLY: (on phone) Yes, sir.  ",5,20
SCULLY: (on phone) I understand.  ,5,20
"SCULLY: (on phone) Yes, Im - Im here with him now.  ",5,20
SCULLY: (on phone) Ill communicate that to him. Is there anything else  any other news?  ,5,20
"SCULLY: (on phone) Right. Well, Ill be here if you need to reach me.  ",5,20
SCULLY: (pauses and sighs) They have her on maximum pressers but shes barely maintaining her pressure.  ,5,20
SCULLY: There are talks going on right now about reassignment.  ,5,20
SCULLY: Both of us. These talks included instructions from the Justice Department to close down the X-Files.  ,5,20
"SCULLY: (sad and tired) Mulder, whatever you may believe, this time they may have won.  ",5,20
"SCULLY: Mulder, I was hoping it wouldn't come up.  ",6,1
"SCULLY: Mulder, let me remind you once again... What I saw was very little.  ",6,1
"SCULLY: Mulder, yes there is a scientific basis for what happened to me. I was exposed to a virus but as it turns out, Mulder, that virus is not what you thought. Look, I can't identify it, Mulder-- I have run three separate tests--but I can tell you without a doubt that that virus' DNA and proteins are very much of this world.  ",6,1
"SCULLY: It attacks and destroys human cells but that is all it does, Mulder. It creates nothing. Look, I don't like telling you this... And I know that you don't want to hear it... Not that you can't question me and what I saw but what you can't question is the science.  ",6,1
"SCULLY: Mulder, I just want to remind you that by not informing local PD we are in technical violation of state laws prohibiting contamination of a crime scene. (She realizes MULDER is not listening. Under her breath.) Why do I bother?  ",6,1
SCULLY: What are they?  ,6,1
SCULLY: With what kind of weapon?  ,6,1
"SCULLY: His bare hands? Mulder, this is hardwood.  ",6,1
SCULLY: This kind of gouging didn't happen with anybody's bare hands. Not without the use of some kind of an implement. What is that?  ,6,1
SCULLY: Is it animal?  ,6,1
SCULLY: So the attacker never left.  ,6,1
SCULLY: (warning him) Mulder...  ,6,1
"SCULLY: Mulder, given the scenario that you just described, the rate of gestation would have been less than a day. It would have been about 12 hours, in fact. Okay, forgive the scientific argument just for a moment but you're saying this was done by something newborn?  ",6,1
"SCULLY: Mulder, there isn't anything in the animal kingdom capable of this ferocity. ]  ",6,1
"SCULLY: Mulder, that doesn't mean that I can just accept your theory.  ",6,1
"SCULLY: Mulder, I know what you did. I know what happened to me but without ignoring the science, I can't... Listen, Mulder  (close up of her hand grasping his) You told me that my science kept you honest. That it made you question your assumptions. That by it, I'd made you a whole person. If I change now... It wouldn't be right... or honest.  ",6,1
SCULLY: We received a call that a man was killed here.  ,6,1
"SCULLY: (taking his arm) Let's get out of here, Mulder.  ",6,1
"SCULLY: You weren't getting anywhere, Mulder. It was only making it worse.  ",6,1
"SCULLY: How do they know? Mulder, how do you know?  ",6,1
"SCULLY: Oh, my God. Gibson. Sorry, sweetie. Gibson? Gibson? Gibson, sweetheart? Oh, God.  ",6,1
"SCULLY: (looking down) No. No, you've been worked on by some good doctors. They did a fine job with your stitches.  ",6,1
"SCULLY: They should have changed your bandages, Gibson. You've got some swelling and some infection and you've got a fever. Why did they do this to you?  ",6,1
SCULLY: Communicate with what?  ,6,1
"SCULLY: Mulder, this kid belongs in a hospital.  ",6,1
"SCULLY: Mulder, you can't just take him on some snipe hunt. He's in no condition. He belongs in a bed under constant medical care. Listen to me. What I'm saying is in your best interest, okay? We have to take every precaution. We have to make every effort to ensure that nothing happens to this boy because whatever he is, whatever gives him the ability to do what he does, he's your scientific evidence. It's just like we said. He could be the key to everything in the X-Files.  ",6,1
"SCULLY: No, but what if he could corroborate everything that you're saying? This boy could be our last, best chance.  ",6,1
"SCULLY: Mulder, what's going on?  ",6,1
SCULLY: Where are you going?  ,6,1
"SCULLY: You're going to be fine, Gibson. You're going to be okay.  ",6,1
SCULLY: We're going to get you well.  ,6,1
"SCULLY: (guilty and sorry) We have to run some more tests, Gibson.  ",6,1
"SCULLY: You're a very special boy, Gibson. You know that yourself.  ",6,1
"SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, I found something. I found something you're not going to believe.  ",6,1
"SCULLY: (on phone) We did blood tests on Gibson and, Mulder, there's evidence of the virus in his system.  ",6,1
SCULLY: (on phone) I'm almost positive.  ,6,1
"SCULLY: (on phone) I don't know  I don't know, but I think we're on to something. We're on to something huge-- a link.  ",6,1
SCULLY: (on phone) What?  ,6,1
SCULLY: There was a little boy in that room and he's gone. Does anybody know what happened to that little boy? His name is Gibson Praise. He was just in that room. Does anybody know what the hell is going on?!  ,6,1
SCULLY: That little boy that I brought in is missing.  ,6,1
SCULLY: He's not here!  ,6,1
"SCULLY: (closing the door) Everything WE were told, Mulder.  ",6,1
"SCULLY: You know, Agent Fowley's report to OPR painted the facts in an interesting way. I hope you haven't been betrayed.  ",6,1
"SCULLY: Mulder, Agent Fowley's report states that the man you saw attacked was bludgeoned by an unknown subject. She makes no mention of a little boy who as it happens, is nowhere to be found. It would seem that her report protects everything but you.  ",6,1
"SCULLY: I don't doubt what you saw, Mulder. I don't doubt you. I'm willing to believe, but not in a lie and not in the opposite of what I can prove. It comes down to a matter of trust. (he looks up at her) I guess it always has.  ",6,1
SCULLY: I'm asking you to trust my judgment. To trust me.  ,6,1
"SCULLY: Mulder, these are test results. DNA from the claw nail we found matching exactly the DNA from the virus you believe is extraterrestrial.  ",6,1
SCULLY: Which matches exactly DNA that was found in Gibson Praise.  ,6,1
"SCULLY: No. It's a part of his DNA. In fact, it's a part of all of our DNA. It's called a genetic remnant. It's inactive junk DNA. Except in Gibson it's turned on.  ",6,1
SCULLY: It would mean that all of us are.  ,6,1
"SCULLY: Uh, Virgil Nokes? I'm Agent Scully. This is Agent Mulder. We're with the FBI.  ",6,2
"SCULLY: No, sir. Federal Bureau of Investigation.  ",6,2
"SCULLY: Uh, sir, this is just a routine check but, uh, we understand that you recently placed an order for 5,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate fertilizer.  ",6,2
SCULLY: Excuse me?  ,6,2
"SCULLY: Yeah. Well, as we said, sir this is just routine.  ",6,2
SCULLY: (knowing exactly what MULDER is doing) We'll be happy to help what?  ,6,2
"SCULLY: (definite) Mulder, we're not going to Nevada.  ",6,2
"SCULLY: No. Sorry, Mulder. We have a whole new assignment.  ",6,2
"SCULLY: Look, Mulder, like it or not, humiliated or not, we're on domestic terrorism now and, yes, this is... This is a punishment but if we want to get back to where we want to be we have to follow orders. We can't freelance.  ",6,2
"SCULLY: I think that the obvious assumption is that the woman was shot, regardless of what the police say. Maybe it was a sniper.  ",6,2
"SCULLY: Captain, he may need medical attention.  ",6,2
"SCULLY: (reading) Patrick Garland Crump of Montello, Nevada.  ",6,2
SCULLY: I'm thinking while we're here I might take a look at Mr. Crump's wife.  ,6,2
SCULLY: There's no gunpowder residue... No carbon stippling. There seems to be no evidence of an entry wound whatsoever.  ,6,2
"SCULLY: I'm finding what look like fragments of petrous bone embedded in the remaining portion of the auditory canal. In fact, I seem to be looking straight through to the osseous labyrinth or what's left of it.  ",6,2
SCULLY: May I?  ,6,2
SCULLY: There seems to be some kind of tumefaction within the lateral sinus.  ,6,2
"SCULLY: (on phone) Oh, God. Come on, Mulder.  ",6,2
"SCULLY: Hey, you, out! This lab is quarantined. Go! (locks doors) Mulder?  ",6,2
"SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, it's me. You know how to pick them, I'll tell you that. Look, I have no idea what killed this woman but I have to assume it's communicable.  ",6,2
SCULLY: (on phone) Another body has been found just outside of Montello --- same apparent cause of death - some kind of massive aneurysm or rupture.  ,6,2
"SCULLY: (on phone) And Mulder, I've called the CDC. They're on their way but Patrick Crump may be infected. So you need to quarantine his cell and make sure that anybody who's had any close contact with him whatsoever has been quarantined as well, and that means you, Mulder. You're to have no contact with him whatsoever.  ",6,2
SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder?  ,6,2
SCULLY: Where are they?  ,6,2
SCULLY: Where are they going?  ,6,2
SCULLY: Roadblock?  ,6,2
SCULLY: All right. I want the CDC on-site. I want the officers making the arrest to be wearing level two or better anti-contamination suits. I want the car decontaminated. I want Agent Mulder and Crump decontaminated. I want them quarantined separately.  ,6,2
"SCULLY: What's the report, Captain?  ",6,2
SCULLY: How did Crump know to avoid the roadblock?  ,6,2
SCULLY: Maybe Agent Mulder steered him away from it.  ,6,2
SCULLY: Maybe he knew something that we don't.  ,6,2
SCULLY: Anything?  ,6,2
"SCULLY: No, no. Not necessarily. I mean, something killed these people.  ",6,2
SCULLY: Sorry. Excuse me. (on phone) Scully.  ,6,2
"SCULLY: (on phone) Yes, sir.  ",6,2
"SCULLY: (on phone) Sir, I am not currently in the state of Idaho.  ",6,2
"SCULLY: (on phone) In the course of prosecuting our assignment in Idaho, Agent Mulder and I came across a situation in Nevada which we both strongly felt needed our immediate attention.  ",6,2
"SCULLY: (on phone) Thank you, sir.  ",6,2
SCULLY: (taking latest victim's chart) Can I see that for a minute? (reading) This man worked at Silver State Power reading meters.  ,6,2
SCULLY: What if he read the meter at Vicky Crump's place?  ,6,2
"SCULLY: Okay, I want a thorough search with an eye to the usual disease vectors.  ",6,2
SCULLY: I think we're witnessing the same pathology here.  ,6,2
SCULLY: Let's go.  ,6,2
SCULLY: Hang on. Let me sedate him.  ,6,2
"SCULLY: Dogs, housewives... Whatever this thing is, it doesn't discriminate.  ",6,2
SCULLY: Look at that.  ,6,2
SCULLY: Hello! Hello?  ,6,2
SCULLY: Doctor? (he joins her) Hello? Hello?  ,6,2
"SCULLY: Oh, no. It's okay, ma'am.  ",6,2
SCULLY: It's all right. I'm sorry.  ,6,2
SCULLY: It's okay. It's okay.  ,6,2
SCULLY: (to DOCTOR) One deaf woman survives unscathed while everything else around her dies. Why?  ,6,2
SCULLY: The pathology of this thing... It affects the inner ear and this area right here is ground zero. What if what we're looking for is some kind of a sound?  ,6,2
SCULLY: Oh. Excuse me. (on phone) Scully.  ,6,2
SCULLY: (on phone) Come again?  ,6,2
"SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah, yeah, yeah. Read it to me.  ",6,2
SCULLY: (on phone) Take him at his word. Let him through.  ,6,2
SCULLY: (on phone) I'll take that under advisement.  ,6,2
SCULLY: Lieutenant Breil? My name is Dana Scully. I called in regard to the electrical equipment the Navy is maintaining in the town of Montello.  ,6,2
SCULLY: My Washington office?  ,6,2
"SCULLY: Oh, I'm... I'm so sorry to make you run through it again, uh... For my official report to the, uh... To the FCC.  ",6,2
SCULLY: The ground conduction radio-- th-that would be Project Seafarer?  ,6,2
"SCULLY: Sure, sure. Um... Would you happen to know what effect such a surge might have on, uh... On an organism... Say, a... Say, a human being? (pause) Theoretically speaking.  ",6,2
"SCULLY: (on phone) Mulder, are you okay?  ",6,2
"SCULLY: (on phone) I'm just about to board a justice department jet... Hopefully, I'll overshoot you.  ",6,2
"SCULLY: (on phone) I don't know, Mulder. You tell me.  ",6,2
"SCULLY: (on phone) Well, I think I have a loose theory as to what caused this.  ",6,2
"SCULLY: (on phone) Okay. Mulder, you know what ELF waves are? Extremely low radio transmissions?  ",6,2
"SCULLY: (on phone) Well, Seafarer has an antenna array stretching beneath the edge of Patrick Crump's property. Now, ELF fields have been shown to... To produce biological effects in human tissue inducing electrical currents, altering chemical reactions.  ",6,2
"SCULLY: (on phone) What if some overload some... Some hum from this system could somehow match the resonant frequency of the human skull? I mean, what if it could induce a like hum that could... That could somehow exert a rising pressure on the labyrinth of the inner ear in a sense shattering it?  ",6,2
"SCULLY: (on phone) I don't know, Mulder, I don't know. I mean... I mean, maybe it has to follow certain lines of force electrical or magnetic. I mean, maybe...  ",6,2
"SCULLY: (on phone) Well, I think I know, Mulder, but it's nothing that Mr. Crump is going to like.  ",6,2
SCULLY: Get ready!  ,6,2
"SCULLY: Sir, Agent Mulder has been through a lot.  ",6,2
"SCULLY: I'm not apologizing for this. Because of his work, the DOD is shutting down their antenna array in northeastern Nevada. Our participation in this case has saved lives.  ",6,2
"SCULLY: (""yeah, right"" tone) Right.  ",6,2
"SCULLY: (under her breath, but loudly enough to be heard) Big piles of manure.  ",6,2
SCULLY: What are you guys doing here?  ,6,3
SCULLY: What do you mean?  ,6,3
"SCULLY: Okay, where are we going?  ",6,3
SCULLY: (impatient) I have ears. Will you tell me what's going on?  ,6,3
SCULLY: Disappeared from where?  ,6,3
SCULLY: I don't understand. What am I looking at?  ,6,3
SCULLY: The Queen Anne? The British luxury liner?  ,6,3
SCULLY: It was torpedoed by a German U-boat.  ,6,3
SCULLY: There's another?  ,6,3
SCULLY: So you're saying the Queen Anne just disappeared.  ,6,3
SCULLY: That's impossible.  ,6,3
SCULLY: There's nothing on here.  ,6,3
SCULLY: To get where?  ,6,3
SCULLY: He's gone out here?  ,6,3
SCULLY: What's happened to him?  ,6,3
"SCULLY: Well, we have to get help.  ",6,3
SCULLY: What do you need?  ,6,3
SCULLY: (writing down the information) Wait for me downstairs.  ,6,3
SCULLY: (to SKINNER's SECRETARY) I need to speak with him.  ,6,3
SCULLY: Is he in?  ,6,3
"SCULLY: Sorry, this can't wait.  ",6,3
SCULLY: Sir?  ,6,3
"SCULLY: I just received some very disturbing information, sir. I need your help.  ",6,3
"SCULLY: Sir, I couldn't waste time explaining myself to your assistant.  ",6,3
SCULLY: It's about Agent Mulder. He's done something incredibly rash.  ,6,3
SCULLY: He may be lost at sea.  ,6,3
SCULLY: You can't what?  ,6,3
SCULLY: This isn't for me; it's for Agent Mulder.  ,6,3
SCULLY: Don't you want to know what this is about?  ,6,3
"SCULLY: (pleading) Sir, this is about a man's life.  ",6,3
"SCULLY: No, sir, you're out of line. I'm sorry, but I'm coming to you for help and I've got nowhere else to go. I would hope that after everything that we have been through that you would at least have the courtesy and the decency and not to mention the respect to listen to what I have to say. Now, all I need is information. (SKINNER takes SCULLY's note and glances over it.) You don't have to do anything else. Look, sir, if you know anybody at the Office of Naval Intelligence it would be of great help.  ",6,3
"SCULLY: Save your own ass, sir. You'll save your head along with it.  ",6,3
SCULLY: (turning quickly) Sorry.  ,6,3
SCULLY: I need a word with AD Kersh.  ,6,3
"SCULLY: Assistant Director Kersh, may I please have a moment of your time?  ",6,3
"SCULLY: Uh, may I, sir? (enters the office) Thank you. Sir, I need you to get me some information. (holds up notepaper) I am not a liberty to say why but I can tell you it is of the utmost importance  ",6,3
"SCULLY: . I, uh... Sorry. I shouldn't have come unannounced.  ",6,3
"SCULLY: Uh... It's nothing, really.  ",6,3
SCULLY: What am I thinking? What am I thinking?  ,6,3
SCULLY: Sorry.  ,6,3
"SCULLY: (whispering, willing someone to answer the phone, hitting button for the basement) Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Answer the phone, Mulder. Answer the phone, answer the phone, answer the phone.  ",6,3
SCULLY: (hanging up) Damn.  ,6,3
SCULLY: (direct) I want you to do me a favor. It's not negotiable. Either you do it or I kill you. You understand?  ,6,3
"SCULLY: No, I'm not. I'm a gun ready to go off so don't test me, Spender. Don't even think about trying to weasel me.  ",6,3
"SCULLY: (writing it down for him) Navy AWACS SLAR 100 K swath. South-southeast of Bermuda. I am looking for a boat, maybe a ship. 1939 luxury liner.  ",6,3
"SCULLY: Don't ask too many questions. I don't care what you do or who you do or who you have to grease, I need that information and I need it now. Are we clear on that?  ",6,3
"SCULLY: And, Agent Spender... If you're not back in a hurry I am going to hunt you down, and so help me God... (she clenches her hand in a fist)  ",6,3
"SCULLY: (under her breath) Oh, God.  ",6,3
SCULLY: (on phone) Hello?  ,6,3
"SCULLY: (on phone, pause, slightly lowers voice) Yes.  ",6,3
"SCULLY: (on phone) I'm sorry, he's not here right now. Is there something I can help you with?  ",6,3
"SCULLY: Yes? Yes, sir?  ",6,3
"SCULLY: I was just, uh...  ",6,3
"SCULLY: Yeah, I was waiting for Agent Spender, he was, uh... I'm supposed to pick up a delivery from him.  ",6,3
SCULLY: (furious) That rat bastard!  ,6,3
SCULLY: (to herself) Stupid!  ,6,3
"SCULLY: (on phone) Scully. (she can barely hear the other person) Mulder? (hopefully) Is that you? No, I can't... I'm on an elevator. Hold on, I'll be off in a s... Hold on.  ",6,3
SCULLY: (on phone) Hello? No... I can't understand. I can't...  ,6,3
SCULLY: Is it you?  ,6,3
SCULLY: How?  ,6,3
"SCULLY: (grateful) Sir, what you've done...  ",6,3
SCULLY: Yes.  ,6,3
SCULLY: Yes.  ,6,3
SCULLY: (excited) Yes.  ,6,3
SCULLY: (holding up paper triumphantly) Yeah.  ,6,3
SCULLY: (coming up from the cabin) What?  ,6,3
SCULLY: Is it the Queen Anne?  ,6,3
SCULLY: I don't believe it.  ,6,3
SCULLY: They've got power.  ,6,3
SCULLY: Let's hope he is.  ,6,3
SCULLY: Byers? Langly? Frohike?  ,6,3
SCULLY: (finding the GUNMEN) There you guys are.  ,6,3
"SCULLY: Mulder? Mulder, it's me. Hmm?  ",6,3
SCULLY: You're in a hospital.  ,6,3
SCULLY: Lie still.  ,6,3
"SCULLY: I don't blame you. You've been through the wringer, I'd say.  ",6,3
SCULLY: You did something incredibly stupid.  ,6,3
"SCULLY: You went looking for a ship, Mulder. In the Bermuda Triangle.  ",6,3
SCULLY: Hmm?  ,6,3
"SCULLY: Mulder, will you settle down? It's an order.  ",6,3
SCULLY: Yeah... You're right. I did.  ,6,3
"SCULLY: Yeah, I bet you did. The boat that you were on was busted into a million pieces. And as for the Queen Anne it was nothing more than a ghost ship.  ",6,3
"SCULLY: In your dreams. (as if talking to a child) Mulder, I want you to close your eyes and I want you to think to yourself ""there's no place like home.""  ",6,3
SCULLY: Yes?  ,6,3
"SCULLY: Oh, brother... (turns away and leaves the room)  ",6,3
"SCULLY:   (dryly)   I'm all a-tingle.  (they share a look)  So, Mulder, this supposed clandestine source who's contacted you how do we know that he's not just another crackpot whose encyclopedic knowledge of extraterrestrial life isn't derived exclusively from reruns of Star Trek?  ",6,4
"SCULLY:     for the past 50 years, classified experiments involving extraterrestrial technology.  ",6,4
"SCULLY:    Mulder, it's the dim hope of finding that proof that's kept us in this car, or one very much like it for more nights than I care to remember. (MULDER looks at her fondly)   Driving hundreds if not thousands of miles through neighborhoods and cities and towns where people are raising families and buying homes and playing with their kids and their dogs, and... in short, living their lives.   While we - we - we just keep driving.  ",6,4
SCULLY:    Don't you ever just want to stop?  Get out of the damn car?  Settle down and live something approaching a normal life?  ,6,4
SCULLY:    Mulder.  ,6,4
SCULLY:    Hiding top secret test flights?  (MULDER looks at her)  Using technology from UFOs?  ,6,4
"SCULLY:    Come on, Mulder, let's...  ",6,4
"SCULLY:    (to MORRIS)   Come on, Mulder, let's go.  ",6,4
"SCULLY:    Are you all right, Mulder?  ",6,4
"SCULLY:    Well, you haven't said anything since we left those men on the highway.  Is something wrong?  ",6,4
SCULLY:    Okay... If you don't want to talk about it.  ,6,4
SCULLY:    Mulder?  Mulder...  ,6,4
SCULLY:    Hello?  ,6,4
SCULLY:    Hello?!  ,6,4
SCULLY:    Since when do you smoke?  ,6,4
SCULLY:    (to KERSH's ASSISTANT)  I'm sure he's on his way.  ,6,4
SCULLY:    Mulder!  ,6,4
SCULLY:    Mulder... Where have you been?  ,6,4
SCULLY:    You got lost.  ,6,4
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,6,4
"SCULLY:    Well, sir...  ",6,4
"SCULLY:    We were following a lead, sir.  ",6,4
SCULLY:    Mulder.  Mulder!  ,6,4
SCULLY:    What was that about?  ,6,4
"SCULLY:    ""I'd give you his name if I had it""?  Whatever happened to protecting our contacts?  Protecting our work?  ",6,4
SCULLY:    What is going on with you?  ,6,4
"SCULLY:    Mulder, you are acting bizarre.  ",6,4
SCULLY:    Mulder!  ,6,4
SCULLY:  (on phone)    Scully.  ,6,4
"SCULLY:  (on phone)    I'm sorry, who is this?  ",6,4
SCULLY:  (on phone)    Mulder.  ,6,4
SCULLY:  (on phone)    UFO?  ,6,4
SCULLY:  (on phone)    Morris Fletcher.  ,6,4
SCULLY:    (whispering to MORRIS)  Psst.  ,6,4
SCULLY:  (on phone)    Uh... What was what?  ,6,4
"SCULLY:  (on phone)    Mulder, uh... Where are you?  ",6,4
SCULLY:  (on phone)    How can I get in touch with you?  ,6,4
"SCULLY:    That wasn't your source?  Well, I'll run a trace.  ",6,4
SCULLY:    Mulder?  Are you sure that's the best thing to do?  ,6,4
"SCULLY:    (calm, but angry)   It's me.  ",6,4
SCULLY:    What do you think you're doing?  ,6,4
SCULLY:   (trying to be professional)   We got the trace back on the call we received this morning.  It came from a gas station pay phone off of highway 375 three miles east of Groom Lake.  ,6,4
SCULLY:    And I'm thinking it was your source although I don't know why he'd try and impersonate you.  ,6,4
SCULLY:    You don't think that we should follow up on this?  ,6,4
"SCULLY:    (so mad she can barely speak)  Am I out of my mind?  Mulder, you are out of your mind!  What is up with you?!  I'm thinking about having you examined for mental illness or-or drug use or... Or maybe a massive head injury! This is an X-File your life's work, your crusade!  ",6,4
SCULLY:    Hi. My name is Dana Scully.  I'm looking for Morris Fletcher.  ,6,4
"SCULLY:    I'm sorry.  Uh, Morris Fletcher?  ",6,4
"SCULLY:    (nervous)  You're, uh... You're the man from the other night?  From Area 51?  ",6,4
SCULLY:    You phoned me.  Would you mind telling me what this is about?  ,6,4
SCULLY:    Look... Any of that information could have been gathered by anyone.  ,6,4
SCULLY:    I don't know what the point of all of this is.  ,6,4
"SCULLY:    No. You won't, but I wouldn't mind if you came clean with me.  ",6,4
"SCULLY:    Good-bye, Mr. Fletcher.  (walks away)  ",6,4
SCULLY:    (answering phone)   Scully.  ,6,4
"SCULLY:  (on phone)    Uh... Sir, I am...  ",6,4
"SCULLY:  (on phone)    Sir, I don't know what Agent Mulder might have told you, but I...  ",6,4
SCULLY:    I'm sorry.  ,6,4
"SCULLY: You did the right thing, Mulder.  ",6,5
"SCULLY: I've been telling you for years you should play more by the book, haven't I?  ",6,5
"SCULLY: He said that I was willful, insubordinate and not a team player and the FBI didn't need agents that weren't team players.  ",6,5
SCULLY: Two-week suspension without pay.  ,6,5
SCULLY: (heading out the door with her belongings)   See you in two weeks.  ,6,5
SCULLY: Wow. Mulder.  ,6,5
SCULLY: I didn't even know you had a bedroom.  ,6,5
"SCULLY: Uh, no, that's okay.  Thanks.  ",6,5
SCULLY: Oh!  ,6,5
SCULLY: Mulder...  ,6,5
"SCULLY: (pause)  No, I don't hate it.  ",6,5
"SCULLY: ,Do you know what would really be fun?  ",6,5
SCULLY: You first.  ,6,5
SCULLY: You're not Mulder.  ,6,5
"SCULLY: (aiming a little lower)   ""Baby"" me and you'll be peeing through a catheter.  Your name is Morris Fletcher.  It was Mulder who was arrested in the desert.  He was telling the truth about you.  Now, how do we get things back to normal?  ",6,5
SCULLY: Are you through?  ,6,5
SCULLY: Or I just shoot you... Baby.  ,6,5
SCULLY: What about Mulder's source?  The man he was supposed to meet in the desert?  What about him? Do you know how to get in touch with him?  ,6,5
SCULLY: And?  ,6,5
SCULLY: Get going.  ,6,5
SCULLY: Mulder?  Is that really you?  ,6,5
SCULLY: I'm trying to figure out a way to help you.  ,6,5
SCULLY: Open up. (Video feed show MULDER and SCULLY waiting outside the door.  FROHIKE opens the many locks on the door and lets SCULLY and MORRIS in.)  ,6,5
SCULLY: We need your help right now.  ,6,5
"SCULLY:   Who, what, why. I need to know everything that's on that data recorder.  ",6,5
SCULLY: Groom Lake. Outside Area 51.  ,6,5
SCULLY: What's that?  ,6,5
SCULLY: He's not Mulder.  ,6,5
"SCULLY: (uncomfortable)  We think the crash of this particular aircraft-- whatever it was-- resulted in a, uh...  (sighs)  ",6,5
"SCULLY: Shut up, all of you.  If you guys want Mulder back, get me these results.  ",6,5
SCULLY: What is it?  ,6,5
"SCULLY: All right, I want you guys to analyze that data.  Morris...  ",6,5
SCULLY: Get your butt in gear.  ,6,5
SCULLY: (stepping between them)  Enough.  Call me when you guys have some answers.  ,6,5
"SCULLY: (hesitantly)  That is you in there, Mulder, isn't it?  ",6,5
"SCULLY: (hugging herself)   I, uh... I just got off the phone with Frohike. They were able to download and analyze the crash data and, yes, there was an anomalous event that night.  ",6,5
"SCULLY: (not easy for her to say)  Well, that's just it.  It's all about random moments in time... About a series of variables approaching an event horizon.  And even if we... could recreate that moment if we could sabotage another craft...  Mulder, if we were...  If we were off... If the event were off by even one millisecond...  ",6,5
"SCULLY: Something like that, yeah.  ",6,5
SCULLY: Agent Mulder has become AD Kersh's new golden boy.  He's been tasked with returning the flight data recorder that he and I stole. The son of a bitch confesses to Kersh even more than I do to my priest.   I'm just tagging along for the ride.  ,6,5
SCULLY: I'm out of the Bureau.  I've been censured and relieved of my position.  ,6,5
SCULLY: I'd kiss you if you weren't so damn ugly.  ,6,5
"SCULLY: Neither, if I do it first.  ",6,5
SCULLY: I've still got my gun.  ,6,5
"SCULLY: Wait a second, hold on.  Back up.  ",6,5
SCULLY: (an order)   Back up.  ,6,5
SCULLY: I don't understand.  This-this place was burnt to the ground.  ,6,5
"SCULLY: Yeah... This place, two nights ago.  ",6,5
SCULLY: I need to talk to you.  Something's happened.  ,6,5
SCULLY: (to MULDER)   I have to talk to you alone.  ,6,5
"SCULLY: Mrs. Fletcher, we have reason to believe that whatever event caused this to happen may be in the process of reversing.  ",6,5
SCULLY: Only we have to be in its path when it happens.  ,6,5
"SCULLY: Come on, Mulder.  Let's go.  ",6,5
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   Mulder, it's me.  I just wanted to let you know that we slipped under Kersh's radar.  Our little field trip to Nevada went unnoticed.  ",6,5
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   Mulder, I'm sorry that your confidential source didn't pan out.  ",6,5
SCULLY:   (on phone)   Good night.  ,6,5
SCULLY:   (on phone)   You're welcome.  ,6,5
"SCULLY:    Remember your truthfulness is important, Mr. Ginsberg and as a prospective federal employee, I will remind you to answer as honestly as possible.   Okay?  ",6,6
"SCULLY:    (reading)  ""Do you, or have you ever smoked marijuana?""  ",6,6
"SCULLY:    (reading)  ""Have you consorted with people who have now or in the past?""  ",6,6
SCULLY:  Ah.   (on phone)    Scully.  ,6,6
"SCULLY:  (on phone)    Mulder, where are you?  I waited 45 minutes for you this morning.  ",6,6
"SCULLY:  (on phone, knowing exactly what he's up to)  This isn't an X-File?  ",6,6
SCULLY:  (on phone)    You're in Virginia?  ,6,6
"SCULLY:  (on phone)    Mulder, we are supposed to be doing background checks not chasing X-Files.  ",6,6
SCULLY:  (on phone)    And what do you call rooting through his trash?  ,6,6
"SCULLY:  (on phone)    ""We,"" Mulder?  I'm stuck with it.  You're not here.  ",6,6
SCULLY:  (on phone)    As host for his demon seed.  ,6,6
SCULLY:  (on phone)    I saw Rosemary's Baby on cable the other night.  ,6,6
SCULLY:  (on phone)    Mulder...  ,6,6
"SCULLY:  (on phone)    Mulder, I think I found what you're looking for.  I've been up all night going over the medical charts on the Weinsider baby.  ",6,6
"SCULLY:  (on phone)    The prenatal birth defects that you spoke of?  They're all here, but they're subtle.  ",6,6
"SCULLY:  (on phone)    Well, they look to be discrete bony deformities.  There are spurs on the superior aspect of the scapula and small protuberances on the skull adjacent to the coronal suture.  ",6,6
"SCULLY:  (on phone)    Well, they could be recessive characteristics expressed as vestiges of primitive morphology or a developmental anomaly like craniosynostosis.  ",6,6
"SCULLY:  (on phone)    No, I wouldn't look to the father as any kind of dark force here, Mulder.  I think it's the mother and Virginia law on third- trimester abortions requires you to put her under arrest.  ",6,6
"SCULLY:  (on phone)    Labor was induced, Mulder.   In the mother's blood, there was found a significant trace of an herb called mandrake.  It's a poison that's been known to facilitate self-abortion.  ",6,6
SCULLY:  (on phone)    It's also been known to be used as an hallucinogenic.  ,6,6
"SCULLY:  (on phone)    Well, I called the doctor on a hunch and he said that the father was very upset about the news while the mother was quite the opposite.  Look, Mulder, I'm going to fax this information to you so that you can present it to the commonwealth attorney for the county of Roanoke but I think we have your baby snatcher here.  ",6,6
SCULLY:  (on phone)    Mulder?  ,6,6
SCULLY:  (on phone)    I suggest that you proceed very carefully.  This could be very emotional for everybody concerned.  ,6,6
"SCULLY:  (on phone)    Mulder, you're busted.  ",6,6
SCULLY:  (on phone)    I just got an earful from Assistant Director Kersh who got a call from Mr. Weinsider who says that you're harassing him.  ,6,6
"SCULLY:  (on phone)    Mulder...Mulder, I have to tell him something.  What do you want me to say?  ",6,6
"SCULLY:    Mulder, you asked me to come down here and then you're nowhere to be found.  ",6,6
"SCULLY:    Mulder... It's me.  That's your cover story, remember?  ",6,6
"SCULLY:    That's why I was looking for you because, in fact, nobody did anything to her.  Mulder, there is absolutely no evidence of bodily injury of overdose, of suffocation, of anything that would explain why she was in a coma.  ",6,6
"SCULLY:    No, Mulder, I don't think you heard what I said.   I did a complete medical review, just as you asked.  What I'm saying is that there is not a shred of evidence to implicate the husband or anyone.  ",6,6
"SCULLY:    (reading file MULDER hands her)   Ivan Veles, born Czechoslovakia in 1956.  Married twice, widowed twice, no children.  Prosecuted twice for murder of wives Gisele and Helga.  Acquitted twice on lack of evidence.  Who is Ivan Veles?  ",6,6
SCULLY:    Gordy Boitano.  ,6,6
"SCULLY:   (reading)  In Slavic societies the name Veles was synonymous with... the Devil. From the Lithuanian root ""Vele""-- a horned demon who sucks the souls of the innocent.   Mulder, you're not suggesting that he is himself... a devil, are you?  ",6,6
"SCULLY:    Mulder, I will accept that a man can be demonic that he may have demon-like attributes but why would a demon-- if there were such a thing-- BOTHER WITH A 9:00-to-5:00  make room for daddy routine just so he can off his wife and unborn child?  ",6,6
"SCULLY:    Mulder, what are you talking about?  ",6,6
"SCULLY:    What are you saying, that he's trying to propagate?  He's trying to breed?  ",6,6
"SCULLY:    But it doesn't make sense, Mulder.  If he's trying to breed then why would he be snatching his own babies and burying them in his backyard?  ",6,6
"SCULLY:    (sighing)   Mulder, where are we going?  ",6,6
SCULLY:    Do you think he's got a second wife?  ,6,6
SCULLY:    Mulder.  ,6,6
"SCULLY:    It's okay, ma'am.  ",6,6
"SCULLY:    Whatever the truth, Mr. Weinsider you can't hope to bury it now.  ",6,6
SCULLY:    Get the paramedics!  ,6,6
"SCULLY:    Four total.  All here for some time.  Maybe years. All normal, though, Mulder.  No osteological deformities.  And Betsy's baby isn't here. There are no fresh graves.  ",6,6
SCULLY:    What do you think he did with it?  ,6,6
"SCULLY:    But she was recently pregnant.  I mean, I-I saw her records.  There are sonograms in the house.  Showing the same defects.  ",6,6
"SCULLY:    Well, whose babies were they?  ",6,6
SCULLY:    Betsy?  ,6,6
SCULLY:     to what?  ,6,6
SCULLY:    (to MULDER)   Don't look at me.  This was your idea.  ,6,7
"SCULLY:   (professional)   I'm Agent Scully, Agent Mulder's partner.  I'm... sure the accommodations will be just fine.  ",6,7
"SCULLY:    Uh, sir you mentioned a crisis.  Agent Mulder has been a little  ah   vague as to the specifics of this crisis.  ",6,7
SCULLY:    A single man?  ,6,7
SCULLY:    You mean cloud seeding?  ,6,7
"SCULLY:    Well, sir, if this man Mootz could, in fact, somehow produce rain then what's the crime?  ",6,7
SCULLY:    And this is what you told Agent Mulder when you spoke earlier?  ,6,7
SCULLY:    (not believing it)    A man... controlling... the weather.  ,6,7
"SCULLY:    Mulder, I see the vacant buildings.  I see the signs.  These people are scared.  But there have always been droughts and natural disasters and people are always looking for a scapegoat.  ",6,7
"SCULLY:    If we could get a list of all the people who have employed his services, it would be helpful.  ",6,7
"SCULLY:    We usually just say, ""please.""  ",6,7
SCULLY:    So you actually believe that he makes it rain?  ,6,7
SCULLY:    Is it possible that he could have just followed it up there?  ,6,7
SCULLY:    I'm not su...  ,6,7
SCULLY:    (showing badge)   We're Agents Mulder and Scully.  We're with the FBI.  ,6,7
"SCULLY:    Uh, Mr. Hardt, what can you tell us about Daryl Mootz?  ",6,7
SCULLY:    You don't think he's responsible.  ,6,7
SCULLY:    Thank you.  (to MULDER)  Can we go now?  ,6,7
"SCULLY:    I hear a big ""but"" coming.  ",6,7
"SCULLY:    Look at the desperation on these people's faces, Mulder.  They're ready to believe anything.  ",6,7
"SCULLY:    We just came to see the show.  I guess, uh, we're a little early.  ",6,7
"SCULLY:    Mulder, what are we doing here?  ",6,7
"SCULLY:    Mulder, that is not a rain dance.  My Irish Aunt Olive has more Cherokee in her than Daryl Mootz.  I mean, look at him, Mulder.  Does that look like a man who can control the weather?  ",6,7
"SCULLY:    He's my partner, and we prefer separate rooms.  ",6,7
"SCULLY:    (checking his scalp and forehead)  Mulder, did they check you for head trauma?  ",6,7
"SCULLY:    Perhaps there is.  Mr. Hardt, would you please reassure Agent Mulder that this cow incident was, in fact, a natural phenomenon?  ",6,7
"SCULLY:    Uh... Holman just explained to us that, uh, that a mini-twister is what caused the accident.  ",6,7
SCULLY:    You two were engaged?  ,6,7
SCULLY:    (definitively)   No.  ,6,7
SCULLY:    No doubts.  ,6,7
SCULLY:    Next flight out is 10:00 tomorrow morning.  ,6,7
"SCULLY:    (exasperated)  Mulder, we're going home. The rain stopped this afternoon.  Daryl Mootz is being sued by about 50 people.  There's no case... And you told Sheila yourself that she wasn't controlling the weather.  ",6,7
"SCULLY:    Oh, so, now you're saying that Holman Hardt...  ",6,7
"SCULLY:    Mulder, it is still a huge leap to say that he's manufacturing the weather.  ",6,7
"SCULLY:    ""SAD""-seasonal affective disorder.  ",6,7
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   Mulder, it's me.  ",6,7
SCULLY:   (on phone)   I'm not so sure.  Have you looked outside lately?  It's pea soup.  Our plane can't take off until after this fog lifts.  ,6,7
SCULLY:   (on phone)   Holman?  ,6,7
SCULLY:   (on phone)   Dating advice? From whom?  ,6,7
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   I heard you.  Mulder, when was the last time you went on a date?  ",6,7
"SCULLY:   (to herself, after hanging)   The blind leading the blind.  ",6,7
"SCULLY:    (uncomfortable)   Mulder, the fog has lifted and if you're ready... the plane is waiting.  ",6,7
SCULLY:    A bit. Why?  ,6,7
"SCULLY:    Thunderstorms, I think.  ",6,7
"SCULLY:    Seven inches in the past six hours.  The national weather service has issued a flash flood warning for the county.  Mulder, are you sure he's here?  ",6,7
"SCULLY:    Holman was just telling us that, uh, that he wanted to dance.  ",6,7
"SCULLY:    Sheila... (clears throat)  my partner has a theory and even though I don't share his belief I feel that, given the circumstances you should hear his theory because it involves you and Holman.  Agent Mulder believes that the drought, this storm these bizarre set of weather conditions that have plagued you over the years are... are caused by Holman.  Specifically, that... that his emotions are somehow manifesting themselves in the weather and Agent Mulder believes that-that Holman is... unwittingly destroying this town because of his unspoken love for you.  ",6,7
SCULLY:    (softly)  What?  ,6,7
SCULLY:    What?  ,6,7
"SCULLY:    Well, it seems to me that the best relationships-- the ones that last-- are frequently the ones that are rooted in friendship.  You know, one day you look at the person and you see something more than you did the night before. Like a switch has been flicked somewhere.  And the person who was just a friend is... suddenly the only person you can ever imagine yourself with.  ",6,7
SCULLY:    The storm drains are filling up.  Let's get out of here.  ,6,7
SCULLY:    I called the police.  ,6,7
SCULLY:    Wet?  ,6,7
"SCULLY:    Sorry.  Checkout lines were worse than rush hour on the 95. If I heard ""Silent Night"" one more time I was going to start taking hostages. What are we doing here?  ",6,8
SCULLY:    On Christmas Eve?  ,6,8
SCULLY:    No kidding.  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    Mulder, I've got wrapping to do.  It's the night before Christmas.  ",6,8
SCULLY:    Let's hear it.  Give me the details.  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    Mulder, I drove all the way out here.  I might as well know why. Right?  ",6,8
SCULLY:    Who lives in the house?  ,6,8
SCULLY:    Then who are we staking out?  ,6,8
SCULLY:    They've come back?  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    I see.  The dark, gothic manor the, uh, omnipresent low fog hugging the thicket of overgrowth.  Wait-- is that a hound I hear baying out on the moors?  ",6,8
"SCULLY:    Mulder, tell me you didn't call me out here on Christmas Eve to go ghost busting with you.  ",6,8
"SCULLY:    Mulder, call it what you want.  I've got holiday cheer to spread. I've got a family roll call under the tree at 6:00 a.m.  ",6,8
SCULLY:    Okay.  ,6,8
SCULLY:    (not impressed)   You said that.  ,6,8
SCULLY:    Go on.  ,6,8
SCULLY:    And what happened to them?  ,6,8
SCULLY:    They killed themselves?  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    It's a good story, Mulder... And very well told but I don't believe it.  ",6,8
SCULLY:    That surprises you?  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    Mulder, if it were any other night I might let you talk me into it but the halls are decked and I got to go.  ",6,8
"SCULLY:    What are you doing?  Mulder, don't you have somewhere to be?  ",6,8
"SCULLY:    (alone, to herself)   I'm not going to do it.  My New Year's resolution.  ",6,8
SCULLY:    Mulder!  ,6,8
SCULLY:    Did you take my car keys?  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    Come on, Mulder. Don't kid around.  ",6,8
"SCULLY:    Maybe you, uh... Maybe you grabbed them by mistake.  ",6,8
"SCULLY:    There must be a window open upstairs.  You know, the weather report said that there was an 80 percent chance of rain maybe even a... maybe even a white Christmas.  ",6,8
"SCULLY:    (still trying the doors)   Mulder, will you quit trying to scare me and help me get these doors open.  ",6,8
"SCULLY:    Mulder, I really have to go.  ",6,8
"SCULLY:    I'm not afraid, okay?  ",6,8
"SCULLY:    You are not scaring me, Mulder.  ",6,8
"SCULLY:    Look, I really have to get home.  ",6,8
SCULLY:   Mulder...  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    These are tricks that the mind plays.  They are ingrained cliches from a thousand different horror films.  When we hear a sound, we get a chill. We-we see a shadow and we allow ourselves to imagine something that an otherwise rational person would discount out of hand. The whole... Mulder...? (follows him up to the second floor)  The whole idea of a benevolent entity fits perfectly with what I'm saying.  That a spirit would materialize or return for no other purpose than to show itself is silly and ridiculous.  I mean, what it really shows is how silly and ridiculous we have become in believing such things.  I mean, that...  That we can ignore all natural laws about the corporeal body- (MULDER tries a locked door) that-that we witness these spirits clad in-in their own shabby outfits with the same old haircuts and hairstyles never aging, never... Never in search of more comfortable surroundings-- it actually ends up saying more about the living than it does about the dead.  ",6,8
"SCULLY:    I mean, Mulder, it doesn't take an advanced degree in psychology to understand the... the unconscious yearnings that these imaginings satisfy. You know, the-the longing for immortality the hope that there is something beyond this mortal coil- (MULDER tries another locked door)  that-that we might never be long without our loved ones. I mean, these are powerful, powerful desires.  I mean, they're the very essence of what make us human. The very essence of Christmas, actually.  ",6,8
SCULLY:    All right.  I'm afraid... but it's an irrational fear.  ,6,8
SCULLY:   (whispers)  Thank you.  ,6,8
"SCULLY:   Mulder, did it occur to you that there aren't ghosts here but that somebody actually might be living in this house?  ",6,8
SCULLY:    But when you and I were sitting out in the car there was not a light on.  And look at this.  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    Mulder, did you happen to notice the clock downstairs is keeping perfect time?  ",6,8
SCULLY:    And how do you explain that?  ,6,8
SCULLY:    This fire has just gone out.  ,6,8
SCULLY:    Don't look so disappointed.  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    Mulder, it's not enough that it's haunted?  It has to be cursed?  ",6,8
SCULLY:    Mulder?  ,6,8
SCULLY:    That's not funny!  ,6,8
SCULLY:    What are you going to do?  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    Mulder, don't.  ",6,8
SCULLY:    Not now.  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    Oh, my God.  ",6,8
SCULLY:    It's a woman.  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    Mulder, it looks like they were shot to death.  ",6,8
SCULLY:    You know what's weird?  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    Mulder, she's wearing my outfit.  ",6,8
"SCULLY:    Yeah, well, you know what?  He's wearing yours.  ",6,8
SCULLY:    That's us.  ,6,8
SCULLY:    This is the same room.  ,6,8
SCULLY:    You go through that door and I...  ,6,8
SCULLY:    Right.  ,6,8
SCULLY:    Mulder!  ,6,8
SCULLY:    Mulder?  ,6,8
SCULLY:    I'm a federal agent! I'm armed.  ,6,8
SCULLY:    (finally getting her gun out)     I'm armed.  ,6,8
SCULLY:    (gun shaking)     I'm armed.  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    Please, I'm a little on edge.  Don't come any closer. My name is Special Agent Dana Scully.  And, uh, I can... I can show you my I.D.  ",6,8
"SCULLY:    I can assure you that I'm not.  I, uh, I got stuck in this room looking for my partner.  ",6,8
SCULLY:    You've seen him?  ,6,8
SCULLY:    Oh... That was you.  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    (catching her breath)  I am sorry... I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to scare you.  I, uh...  It's just that we found bodies.  ",6,8
SCULLY:    Right...  ,6,8
SCULLY:    (raising gun again)  Who are you?  ,6,8
SCULLY:    Where's my partner?  ,6,8
SCULLY:    There were corpses right there underneath the floor!  ,6,8
SCULLY:    I don't believe in ghosts.  ,6,8
SCULLY:    It's my partner.  ,6,8
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,6,8
SCULLY:    Don't come any closer.  ,6,8
SCULLY:    What?  ,6,8
SCULLY:    You don't know me.  And you don't live here. This isn't your house.  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    Well, then why is all the furniture covered?  ",6,8
SCULLY:    Well then where's your Christmas tree?!  ,6,8
SCULLY:    Hold it right there.  Don't make me shoot you. Stay where you are.  ,6,8
SCULLY:    Where's Mulder?  ,6,8
SCULLY:    Where is he?  ,6,8
SCULLY:    Move over there.  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    (trying to sound authoritative)   Both of you, move. Move over there.  Move other there.  ",6,8
SCULLY:    Put your hands up.  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    Stay away from me. Look, I want you to get me out of here. I am quite capable of pulling this trigger.  ",6,8
SCULLY:    What have you done with him?!  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    Look, all I know is this is just some bad dream. This is all in my head.  ",6,8
SCULLY:    Mulder!  ,6,8
SCULLY:    Where did you get those?  ,6,8
SCULLY:    Where did you get those keys?  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    I'm here, Mulder!  ",6,8
"SCULLY:    (taking keys, to MAURICE)   Open the door.  ",6,8
SCULLY:    I don't believe you.   Just open the door.  ,6,8
SCULLY:    Open the door!  ,6,8
SCULLY:    Mulder?  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    Mulder, what are you doing?  (he fires again)   Mulder!  ",6,8
"SCULLY:    Mulder, come on... Mulder, don't come any closer. You're scaring me.  Put the gun down!  ",6,8
SCULLY:    I'm not going to shoot you!  I don't want to shoot you!  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    Mulder, look... We don't have to do this.  ",6,8
SCULLY:    We can get out of here.  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    I don't believe what you're saying!  Mulder, I don't believe a word of it.  ",6,8
SCULLY:    Mulder!  ,6,8
SCULLY:    (weak)  Mulder... Is that you?  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    I didn't believe it, Mulder.  ",6,8
SCULLY:    I didn't believe that you'd do it... That I would...  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    Merry Christmas, Mulder.  ",6,8
SCULLY:    ( whispering as she lowers the gun and falls back on to the floor)  Ah... I'm not going to make it.  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    Are you afraid, Mulder?  (gasping)  I am.  ",6,8
SCULLY:    You should have.  ,6,8
SCULLY:    (also accusing)   I didn't shoot you.  You shot me.  ,6,8
SCULLY:    What?  ,6,8
SCULLY:    I can't.  ,6,8
SCULLY:    What?  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    I, uh... I couldn't sleep.  I was, um... ( sighing )  ",6,8
"SCULLY:    Mulder... None of that really happened out there tonight... That was all in our heads, right?  ",6,8
"SCULLY:    Mmm. Not that, uh, my only joy in life is proving you wrong.  ",6,8
SCULLY:    Well... Why else would you want me out there with you?  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    No, I mean... Maybe I did want to be out there with you.  ",6,8
SCULLY:    Mulder...  ,6,8
"SCULLY:    Well, I got you a little something, too.  ",6,8
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   No, no, ma'am.  This is just a routine background check.  Mr... Mr. Garber is not in any legal trouble whatsoever.  Yeah.  Okay. Thanks for your time.  (hangs up)  ",6,9
SCULLY:    You ready to quit?  ,6,9
SCULLY:   Scully.   (she listens)   I'm on my way.  ,6,9
SCULLY:    I've been called into Kersh's office.  ,6,9

SCULLY:    (READING)   A NEIGHBOR CALLED THE POLICE AT 11:14 p.m.  ,6,9
"SCULLY:    The clock says that it's 45 minutes earlier.   Well, a clock can be wrong.  ",6,9
SCULLY:    Hmm.  Almost an hour and a half later.  ,6,9
SCULLY:    And you suspect this man Fellig?  You think that Mrs. Stoller wasn't a suicide?  ,6,9
SCULLY:    That's quite a theory.  ,6,9
SCULLY:    You can tell the time of day by the shadows.  ,6,9
SCULLY:    (reading)   You've got another suicide here a heart attack and a very obvious murder for which another man was convicted.  There's no consistent MO.  ,6,9
SCULLY:    Agent Mulder and I will begin immediately.  ,6,9
SCULLY:    Mulder...  ,6,9
SCULLY:    What are you doing?  ,6,9
SCULLY:    (packing up her briefcase)  It's not an X-File.  ,6,9
SCULLY:    Thank you.  All very helpful.  ,6,9
SCULLY:    No.  ,6,9
SCULLY:    This is a one-time thing.  ,6,9
"SCULLY:    Peyton Ritter, this is Fox Mulder.  ",6,9
SCULLY:    We should get going.  ,6,9
"SCULLY:    Well, he sometimes doubles as a crime scene photographer for your precinct.  ",6,9
SCULLY:    There's not much in the way of personal information there.  ,6,9
SCULLY:    Would you happen to know when the original background check was done?  ,6,9
SCULLY:    I think I've got it.  1964.  ,6,9
SCULLY:    Maybe.  ,6,9
SCULLY:    Take a look at this.  ,6,9
SCULLY:    1996... '87...'73  ,6,9
SCULLY:    You're thinking this was Fellig's work?  ,6,9
SCULLY:    What's this?  ,6,9
SCULLY:    Yeah. I got that.  ,6,9
SCULLY:    Where's the second body?  ,6,9
SCULLY:    (taking over)  Mr. Fellig your fingerprints were found on a murder weapon at a crime scene.  Could you give us a full accounting of your activities last night?  ,6,9
SCULLY:    Your fingerprints were found on the knife.  How did they get there?  ,6,9
"SCULLY:    Why would you do that?  Were you injured Mr. Fellig?  You seem to be in pain.  Were you attacked?  We found other blood at the crime scene and, when we have it tested I'm wondering if we're going to learn that it's yours.  ",6,9
SCULLY:    May we see?  ,6,9
SCULLY:     May I help you?  ,6,9
SCULLY:   (calmly)   I thought we were looking for the truth.  ,6,9
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Scully.  ,6,9
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   Mulder, it's not...  (waits for AGENT RITTER to step away)   We haven't made much headway.  We arrested Alfred Fellig and we just released him.  ",6,9
SCULLY:   (on phone)   How do you know about that?  ,6,9
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   Well, we were able to pull another set of prints off of the knife.  They belong to a convicted murderer by the name of Malcolm Wiggins.  ",6,9
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   That and the fact that Fellig's blood was found all over the crime scene tells me that his story checks out.  At least that particular story, anyway.  ",6,9
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   I don't know what to think.  (looks up as FELLIG passes her)  He's, uh... unusual.  ",6,9
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   Mulder, where are you getting this stuff?  ",6,9
SCULLY:   (on phone)   Mulder...  ,6,9
SCULLY:    I'm parked around the block.  ,6,9
"SCULLY:    Mr. Fellig, open up, please!  ",6,9
SCULLY:    Explain this.  ,6,9
SCULLY:    You took that photo an hour before police arrived.  You then purposely covered up that fact by photographing the scene again.  ,6,9
"SCULLY:    You have, Mr. Fellig, a long and uncanny history of being the first person at the scene of a death.  You also have a history of covering up that fact.  Why?  ",6,9
SCULLY:    Are you a murderer?  ,6,9
"SCULLY:    Well, then explain yourself, sir.  Because, I promise you until you do, you will not get a moment's peace.  ",6,9
SCULLY:    It's been an hour.  Are we going to drive around all night?  ,6,9
SCULLY:    What shot?  ,6,9
SCULLY:    What...  what are you talking about?  ,6,9
"SCULLY:    Look, Mr... Fellig, I don't know what you're planning but nobody here is going to die.  ",6,9
SCULLY:    (disbelieving)   That   that woman right there is going to be murdered?  ,6,9
SCULLY:    You want me to believe that?  ,6,9
SCULLY:    FBI! Don't move!  ,6,9
SCULLY:    Shut up!  Get down!  Back up!  ,6,9
SCULLY:    (to HOOKER)  You all right?  ,6,9
SCULLY:    Assault and possession of an unregistered handgun.  I'll be with you in a minute.  ,6,9
SCULLY:    I apologize.  ,6,9
"SCULLY:    No offense, but the surveillance was blown before I got there.  ",6,9
SCULLY:    I confronted Fellig.  I questioned him further about his involvement in the deaths that he photographed.  Is that okay with you?  ,6,9
"SCULLY:    He said that he can tell when people are about to die.  Look, if New York passes a Good Samaritan law we might be able to nail him on that but other than that, I doubt we're going to get him for murder.  ",6,9
SCULLY:    A convicted murderer half Fellig's age.  ,6,9
"SCULLY:    He's right. Tell me, Ritter, did he have any help concocting that story?  ",6,9
SCULLY:    No judge is going to issue a warrant based on this.  ,6,9
"SCULLY:    Uh, he did?  ",6,9
SCULLY:    (coldly correcting him)    Scully.  ,6,9
SCULLY:    And we're done with this conversation.  ,6,9
SCULLY:    (on phone)   Yeah?  ,6,9
SCULLY:   (on phone)   It is.  ,6,9
SCULLY:   (on phone)   Alfred Fellig seems to know an awful lot about death.  ,6,9
SCULLY:   (on phone)   Excuse me?  ,6,9
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   But Mulder, that must be some kind of a mistake.  ",6,9
SCULLY:   (on phone)    I have spent time with this man and-and he can't be more than 65 years old.  ,6,9
"SCULLY:    You are going to be arrested, Mr. Fellig, in two hours, charged with murder, and this time you won't be able to just change your name.  ",6,9
"SCULLY:    What you showed me was a contemptible lack of compassion for another human being.  You showed me that you profit off of people's deaths. Now, why shouldn't you go to prison?  ",6,9
"SCULLY:    ""Lucky""?  ",6,9
SCULLY:    Who's he?  ,6,9
SCULLY:    You're saying that this is a photograph of Death itself?  ,6,9
SCULLY:    And this is the shot that you spoke of-- this is... what you try and get?  ,6,9
"SCULLY:    Mr. Fellig, I know... that you know more about photography than I do but this is just a lens flare.  ",6,9
"SCULLY:    (sighs)  Okay, I mean... mmm   for the sake of argument... why bother?  I mean, why... why take a picture of Death?  ",6,9
SCULLY:    You know I don't believe you.  ,6,9
SCULLY:    How is it you know when people are about to die?  ,6,9
SCULLY:    Excuse me.  ,6,9
"SCULLY:   (on phone, very quietly)   Mulder, it's me.  ",6,9
SCULLY:   (on phone)   Those other two names that you said that Fellig went by-- Strand and Rice...?  ,6,9
SCULLY:   (on phone)   What about Louis Brady?  ,6,9
SCULLY:   (on phone)   Will you check it out for me?  ,6,9
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   I'm sticking here to make sure he doesn't bolt.  Louis Brady, Mulder.  Tell me what you find out.  ",6,9
SCULLY:    Mr. Fellig?  ,6,9
"SCULLY:    You know, most people want to live forever.  ",6,9
"SCULLY:    I think you're wrong.  How can you have too much life?  There's too much to learn, to experience.  ",6,9
SCULLY:    What about love?  ,6,9
"SCULLY:    Why are you this way?  I mean, if this is true give me something in the way of proof... help me find some science that I can hang this on.  ",6,9
SCULLY:    Took your place?  ,6,9
SCULLY:    But he didn't.  ,6,9
SCULLY:    What do you mean?  (no answer)  Wait a minute.  Say what's on your mind.  You mean lucky like the others?  You want me to believe that I'm about to die?  ,6,9
SCULLY:    You took my picture.  You took my picture last night.  Is this why?  ,6,9
SCULLY:    I'm not going to die!  (he turns on the camera)  Turn that off.  ,6,9
SCULLY:    Turn it off right now!  Put it down!  ,6,9
SCULLY:    You took my phone.  Why?  ,6,9
SCULLY:    What don't you want me to know?  ,6,9
SCULLY:    What don't you want me to know!?  ,6,9
SCULLY:    Shut up!  ,6,9
"SCULLY:    Yeah, Mulder, I don't even know how I entertained the thought. People don't live forever.  ",6,9
SCULLY:   Not that I could tell if there was.  Why are all the lights out?  ,6,10
SCULLY:    What did you do?  ,6,10
SCULLY:    Says who?  ,6,10
"SCULLY:    Hey, hey, hey.  (gently pushes him back down)   In the last 48 hours, did you eat or drink anything that tasted metallic or otherwise odd?  ",6,10
SCULLY:    Did the doctor take your blood?  ,6,10
"SCULLY:    Well, if you were poisoned, it could have been overlooked.  ",6,10
SCULLY:    I know.  But you are.  You still supervise them.  ,6,10
"SCULLY:    Look, it could've been anything.  It could have been the slightest touch, or a handshake.  ",6,10
SCULLY:    And then what?  ,6,10
SCULLY:    It wouldn't necessarily leave a mark.  Some poisons are absorbed through the skin.  ,6,10
SCULLY:    Wait a second. Back up.  It can't be.  That's Kenneth Orgel.  An advisor to a Senate subcommittee on ethics and new technology.  ,6,10
"SCULLY:    A physicist.  Very well known, as far as physicists go.  ",6,10
SCULLY:    Why would he be coming to see you?  ,6,10
"SCULLY:    Sir, if this man poisoned you, you should be off your feet and under a doctor's care.  ",6,10
SCULLY:    What hospital was he at?  ,6,10
"SCULLY:    Yes, you released him from your care earlier this evening.  ",6,10
"SCULLY:    Well, that's why I'm here.  He may have been poisoned.  ",6,10
"SCULLY:    I don't know.  In fact, I'm not even sure what I'm looking for.  ",6,10
SCULLY:    Is this them in here?  ,6,10
SCULLY:    We may not have time.  He may not have time either.  ,6,10
SCULLY:    Are you sure these haven't been processed?  ,6,10
SCULLY:    How is it working as a poison?  ,6,10
SCULLY:    Look at them-- just rattling around in the solution.  ,6,10
SCULLY:    Did you just touch something?  ,6,10
SCULLY:    It just multiplied.  Look!  It just did it again.  ,6,10
SCULLY:    Dr. Plant?  ,6,10
"SCULLY:    I think I've found it.  I think I found what the carbon's doing. It's, uh...it's not just reproducing itself.  It has behavior.  It's creating something,  a-a matrix stimulated by blood flow in response to movement.  It's multiplying and solidifying in an orderly fashion.  It's building valves or-or dams in the vascular system.  ",6,10
SCULLY:    Where are they taking him?  ,6,10
SCULLY:    I know this man.  ,6,10
"SCULLY:    Look, I'm sorry.  His name is Walter Skinner.  We've been investigating his illness.  What are you doing?  ",6,10
"SCULLY:    No, that's not going to save him.  It's his blood.  ",6,10
"SCULLY:    You're not going to solve anything until you get a scope into him. Nothing else is going to work.  Look, if you want to save this man listen to what I'm saying.  ",6,10
"SCULLY:    It's okay, sir.  Lie back down.  We're just moving you to another room.  ",6,10
SCULLY:    That's what Mulder's trying to figure out right now.  But we're going to take good care of you.  I promise.  We're going to do everything we can.  ,6,10
"SCULLY:    He's stable, but it's not good, Mulder.  He's got extreme vascular trauma and distension.  His... his blood has become a weapon against his body.  ",6,10
"SCULLY:    We don't know what it is.  I mean, the best that we can do is keep lasering his arteries open.  But it's only going to be a matter of time before we lose.  I mean, it's-it's building walls in his vessels faster than we can tear them down, and...  and we just don't have the technology to combat it.  ",6,10
SCULLY:    What is this?  ,6,10
"SCULLY:    Yeah, but this is just a routine procedure, Mulder.  The FBI does dozens of these a year.  ",6,10
SCULLY:    You're saying that Dr. Orgel poisoned Skinner in order to cover up his analysis?  ,6,10
SCULLY:    New technology.  ,6,10
"SCULLY:    Well, I think I might.  ",6,10
SCULLY:    Who is it?  ,6,10
"SCULLY:    Sir, there's something I'd like to try.  It's a treatment called therapeutic plasmapheresis.  It requires filtering all of the blood in your body.  It's a radical procedure and there is a danger that your body might go into  shock.  ",6,10
SCULLY:    Sir?  ,6,10
SCULLY:    What do you mean?  ,6,10
"SCULLY:    Sir, you know that's not true.  ",6,10
SCULLY:    You've been our ally more times than I can say.  ,6,10
SCULLY:    What?  ,6,10
SCULLY:    Try.  ,6,10
SCULLY:    He was following you?  ,6,10
"SCULLY:    Sir, I've spoken with your doctors and your prognosis is excellent. Whatever you are infected with appears to be dormant and your recovery is being hailed as miracle.  ",6,10
SCULLY:    Sir?  ,6,10
SCULLY:    Mulder it's my distinct impression that you just cheated.  And that you're not coming in again today.  ,6,11
"SCULLY:    Yeah, you got so much game I'm wondering if you have any work left in you.  ",6,11
"SCULLY:    (VERY small smile)  No ""jagoff shoeshine tip""?  ",6,11
"SCULLY:    Well, about your J-O-B, Mulder somebody's been trying very hard to reach you by phone.  Somebody who wants you back at the FBI ASAP.  ",6,11
SCULLY:    About an X-File.  ,6,11
SCULLY:    Didn't expect to find you here.  ,6,11
SCULLY:    I thought Agent Spender offered you an X-File assignment.  ,6,11
SCULLY:    But isn't it just the opportunity you've been waiting for?  ,6,11
SCULLY:    You think it's a setup?  ,6,11
SCULLY:    But Agent Spender asked you.  ,6,11
SCULLY:    We've seen this before.  Bodies set aflame with no conclusive cause of combustion.  Mulder...  ,6,11
SCULLY:    I was with Cassandra Spender when she disappeared.  You sat with me while I was under hypnosis when I spoke of just these sorts of details.  ,6,11
"SCULLY:    I was taken to one of those train cars.  I was tested, just like Cassandra.  What if what she tells us could expose who did this to me? Mulder, Agent Spender doesn't have to know.  ",6,11
SCULLY:    (embracing her)  Cassandra.  ,6,11
SCULLY:    It's so good to see you.  (to DARK-HAIRED WOMAN)  We're old friends.   (to CASSANDRA)   If I can get ahold of a wheelchair you want to go out for some fresh air?  ,6,11
"SCULLY:   (smiling)   I've got a surprise for you, Cassandra.  ",6,11
SCULLY:    Agent Mulder told me he believed he saw his sister... last year.  ,6,11
"SCULLY:    Cassandra, you were found in a train car.  You'd been operated on by doctors.  ",6,11
SCULLY:    And these are the doctors who cured you?  ,6,11
"SCULLY:    But, Cassandra, the doctors weren't infected.  They were burned.  ",6,11
SCULLY:    Why couldn't you tell Jeffrey?  ,6,11
SCULLY:    Spender's life's in danger?  ,6,11
SCULLY:    Working to do what?  ,6,11
SCULLY:    Why risk getting caught here?  ,6,11
SCULLY:    Maybe she was making it all up.  ,6,11
SCULLY:    I bet you're curious about C.G.B.  ,6,11
SCULLY:    C.G.B. Spender-- his name.  Cigarette-Smoking Man?  ,6,11
"SCULLY:    It's an alias, as far as I can figure.  One of hundreds.  ",6,11
SCULLY:    Aren't you curious what I've got in the box?  Everything I could find on him.  ,6,11
SCULLY:    Maybe.  But there's a picture you're going to want to see.  ,6,11
"SCULLY:    It was taken in 1973.  I traced the connection to something they worked on together for 25 years at the state department.  A highly classified project.  There's more, if you're ready.  (Mulder nods)  Cassandra Spender is, indeed, the mother of Agent Jeffery Spender and the ex-wife of C.G.B. Spender. But there's something that you're going to be surprised to find out.  She was first abducted in 1973 on the night of November 27.  ",6,11
"SCULLY:    And there are other names connected to C.G.B. Spender and your father-- Ph.D.s., doctors... one a Nobel winner for early works in genetics. A Dr. Eugene Openshaw.  (MULDER looks at picture.)  He was the doctor that was found amongst the burn victims clinging to life beside Cassandra Spender.  He died the next day in the hospital before he was questioned.  ",6,11
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,6,11
SCULLY:    Sir.  ,6,11
"SCULLY:    It's true, sir.  We have documented evidence.  ",6,11
SCULLY:    How did you find us?  Cassandra?  ,6,11
SCULLY:    How did you get your clothes?  ,6,11
"SCULLY:    Mulder, what are you doing?  ",6,11
"SCULLY:    Mulder!  Mulder, we have to protect her.  ",6,11
SCULLY:    Mulder?   Mulder!  ,6,11
SCULLY:    Mulder?!  ,6,12
SCULLY:    Quarantine for what?  ,6,12
SCULLY:    Are we going to be able to talk to somebody who can tell us what this is all about?  ,6,12
"SCULLY:    I think, based on our travel time probably Fort Marlene.  High risk decontamination and quarantine.  ",6,12
SCULLY:    Based on what information?  ,6,12
SCULLY:    What?  ,6,12
SCULLY:    Where's Cassandra?  ,6,12
"SCULLY:    Cassandra Spender was in a general hospital environment for days. We met with her, and yet on a whim you call in the third battalion.  It's unjustified and highly suspicious as to motive.  ",6,12
SCULLY:    Your isolation of Cassandra.  ,6,12
"SCULLY:    No one is sick or infected here.  I mean, I assume that based on you walking in here dressed to the nines offering apologies masquerading as explanations.  ",6,12
"SCULLY:    Mulder, I want to see Cassandra.  ",6,12
"SCULLY:    Yes, and I am a medical doctor.  ",6,12
SCULLY:    They've burned our clothes.  ,6,12
"SCULLY:    Mulder, this stinks, and not just because I think that woman is a...  well, I think you know what I think that woman is.  ",6,12
"SCULLY:    Agent Spender calling the Centers for Disease Control?  Mulder, this is just somebody using their position to stage a hi-tech government kidnapping.  ",6,12
"SCULLY:    But she wasn't sick, Mulder.  I mean, the remarkable thing is she was well.  ",6,12
"SCULLY:    Because of everything that had been done to her-because of the tests, because of the medical experiments and the implant put in her neck - the same thing that was done to me.  She just wants it to stop.  And I'm telling you, they have taken her so that it can continue.  ",6,12
SCULLY:    What is she?  ,6,12
"SCULLY:    I'll ask you to hear me out before you launch any objection. Mulder, I asked them to pull up everything they could on Diana Fowley.  ",6,12
"SCULLY:    Mulder, she's playing you for a fool.  ",6,12
SCULLY:    You knew her.  You don't anymore.  I think we can prove that to you.  ,6,12
SCULLY:    Yet there isn't a single piece of information available on her activities in the FBI files.  ,6,12
SCULLY:    Travel records pulled from airline manifests that had been purged from her FBI records.  Extensive movement throughout Western Europe.  Almost weekly trips to and from Tunisia.  ,6,12
SCULLY:    Special Agent Diana Fowley of the FBI was visiting every European chapter collecting data on female abductees.  ,6,12
SCULLY:    Or hiding it.  ,6,12
"SCULLY:    Mulder, when I was abducted a chip was put in my neck.  When I happened upon a MUFON group filled with women who'd had the same experience.  ",6,12
"SCULLY:    You tell me that Cassandra Spender is the critical test subject - the one who could prove everything.  And yet, who is watching over her? Mulder, I can prove what you're saying or I can disprove it but not when Diana Fowley is keeping us from even seeing her.  Mulder, ask yourself why there is no information whatsoever on Special Agent Diana Fowley.  Why she would suddenly happen into your life when you are closer than ever to the truth. I mean, you... you ask me to trust no one and yet you trust her on simple faith.  ",6,12
"SCULLY:    Well, then I can't help you anymore.  ",6,12
"SCULLY:    Because it is personal, Mulder.  Because without the FBI personal interest is all that I have.  And if you take that away then there is no reason for me to continue.  ",6,12
"SCULLY:   (on phone,driving)   Mulder, I was just dialing you.  Where are you?  ",6,12
SCULLY:   (on phone)   I'm coming to get you.  ,6,12
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   No, Mulder, listen to me.  I'm going to take you to Cassandra.  ",6,12
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   I know, but I know where she's gone to, Mulder.  ",6,12
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   Mulder, I'm going there whether you're coming or not.  ",6,12
SCULLY:   (on phone)   To the Potomac yards.  They're transporting her by train car.  ,6,12
SCULLY:   (on phone)   Agent Spender called me.  ,6,12
"SCULLY:    Sir, I wouldn't bet against him.  ",6,12
"SCULLY:    We pronounce it ""Pee-trie,"" actually.  ",6,13
"SCULLY:   (struggling with the large basket that MULDER makes no move to help her with)   Pleased to make your acquaintance, Pat.  ",6,13
SCULLY:    I'm sorry?  ,6,13
"SCULLY:    This place really is immaculate, Pat.  I, uh, I wouldn't mind sending a thank-you note to the previous owners.  ",6,13
"SCULLY:    ""Pee-trie.""  ",6,13
SCULLY:    Excuse me!  I'll get that.  It's okay.  ,6,13
SCULLY:    Nice to meet you.  I'm Laura.  ,6,13
SCULLY:    You ready?  ,6,13
"SCULLY:    (smiles)  All right, then.  ",6,13
SCULLY:    Thanks to our friendly neighbors there will be no fluorescein bloodstain enhancement.  ,6,13
"SCULLY:    Okay.  6:01 p.m., February 24.  Agents Scully and Mulder in the former home of David and Nancy Kline who disappeared without a trace last July.  The Klines were the third such couple to disappear since this neighborhood was built in 1991.  All were apparently stable professional people with no history of violence, domestic discord or mental illness and it took a family member or employee to realize that they were gone including their cars and a few personal items.  What local police found in each case was nothing-- just impeccably-manicured homes and a community of neighbors who professed total ignorance that anyone had disappeared.  ",6,13
"SCULLY:    The local police departments were at a dead end so they turned to the FBI.  AD Skinner, in assigning us this case thought a fruitful approach to the investigation would be if we went undercover posing as prospective home buyers as this planned community would seem to hide a dark, possibly murderous conspiracy of silence.  ",6,13
SCULLY:    Rob and Laura Petrie?  ,6,13
"SCULLY:    Mulder, if we ever go undercover again I get to choose the names, okay?  ",6,13
SCULLY:    It just tells me that you're not taking this seriously.  ,6,13
"SCULLY:    Sure it is.  It's unexplained.  What do you want, aliens? Tractor beams?  ",6,13
"SCULLY:    Hi.  Well, you didn't need to do that.  ",6,13
SCULLY:    (shaking his hand)  Hi.  ,6,13
"SCULLY:    Oh.  That's a caduceus.  Are you a doctor, Mike?  ",6,13
"SCULLY:    Mighty nice of you, Mike.  I, uh ... gosh, with all this hospitality, I can't believe the Klines ever left.  (BIG MIKE looks very uncomfortable.)   That, uh... that was their name, wasn't it?  The, uh, the Klines?  ",6,13
SCULLY:    Mulder...  ,6,13
SCULLY:    What you got there?  ,6,13
SCULLY:    Mm-hmm.   (they look up at the fan)  How'd it get way up there?  ,6,13
"SCULLY:    (forced smile)   That's right, Poopyhead.   Win, are we in the right place?  I thought this was Big Mike's house.  ",6,13
SCULLY:    What kind of business?  I thought he was a veterinarian.  ,6,13
SCULLY:    That sounds great.  Thanks.  ,6,13
SCULLY:    (fake smile)  No kidding.  ,6,13
SCULLY:    We did.  ,6,13
SCULLY:    That he wasn't there.  They didn't know where he was.  ,6,13
"SCULLY:    Do you know where he is, Win?  ",6,13
SCULLY:    Would you like company?  ,6,13
SCULLY:    So is this the American dream?  This place?  ,6,13
"SCULLY:    So it's just not your dream.  (CAMI SHROEDER shrugs)  You know, Cami, I-I've noticed that you've, uh,  walked us past Mike's house... twice. Are you worried about him?  ",6,13
SCULLY: . Let me take a look.  ,6,13
SCULLY:    Uh-uh.  ,6,13
SCULLY:    (to dog)  What you got there?  ,6,13
SCULLY:    Let me wipe that off.  That's a good boy.  ,6,13
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   All right, Lieutenant.  ",6,13
SCULLY:   (on phone)   Thank you.  (hangs up and looks at the necklace)  Local PD came up blank on...  ,6,13
SCULLY:     Mike Raskub.  No activity on his credit cards.  No sighting of his '97 Mercury Villager.  ,6,13
SCULLY:    (from the bathroom)  Laura.  ,6,13
SCULLY:    (from the bathroom)  Think it's Win Shroeder?  ,6,13
SCULLY:    (from the bathroom)  Cleaning up for who?  ,6,13
"SCULLY:    (from the bathroom)  Mulder, speaking of cleaning up whoever taught you how to squeeze a tube of toothpaste?  ",6,13
SCULLY:    (from the bathroom)   I'm driving down to San Diego  tomorrow and have it analyzed.  ,6,13
SCULLY:    (From the bathroom)  Third warning: (sound of toilet seat falling) Toilet seat.  (toilet flushes)  ,6,13
SCULLY:    What's missing here is intent.  What would be the motive?  ,6,13
SCULLY:    (pointedly looking at him lying on the bed)   And you don't.  ,6,13
"SCULLY:    Scully, Mulder.  Good night.  ",6,13
SCULLY:    Mulder?  ,6,13
"SCULLY:    Mulder, is that you?  ",6,13
"SCULLY:    Sorry, Mulder.  Somebody was in the house.  ",6,13
SCULLY:    What do you mean?  ,6,13
SCULLY:    (skeptical)   In the ground.  This huge creature you think you saw?  ,6,13
"SCULLY:      Look, Mulder, huge creatures aside do you care to hear what I think?  ",6,13
"SCULLY:    These are the lab results from the San Diego PD.  First of all, the stuff that we found on the fan blade-- the dried blood and scalp hairs?  It's neither.  The blood is predominantly ketchup and brake fluid and the hairs are bristles from a scrub brush and the same goes for the sample we found on the dog's muzzle.  It's coffee grounds, eggshells and motor oil with about 50 other constituents with a little mercurochrome for color.  In other words, Mulder, it's garbage.  Which makes perfect sense because this entire neighborhood has been built upon an old landfill.  ",6,13
"SCULLY:    Mm-hmm. We found this stuff everywhere because it is everywhere. It's just beneath the topsoil and that protrusion in the front yard may occur from the venting of methane gas but... Mulder, I don't see how any of this has to do with the disappearances that we're investigating.  ",6,13
SCULLY:    Yeah?  ,6,13
"SCULLY:    You mean buried in the yard?  (MULDER nods.)  Well, once we start a forensic excavation, our cover's blown.  ",6,13
SCULLY:    (softly)  Hey.  Mulder.  ,6,13
SCULLY:    (gently)   The Klines aren't down there. Maybe it's time you called it a night.  ,6,13
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,6,13
SCULLY:    Where are you going?  ,6,13
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   Yes, this is Special Agent Dana Scully.  I need a full forensic team to 450 Autumn Terrace.  ",6,13
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   No, not tomorrow. Tonight.  ",6,13
SCULLY:   (on phone)   I'm sorry. Can I call you back?  ,6,13
"SCULLY:    (under her breath, really worried)  Jeez.   [closed captioning: ""Jesus.""]  ",6,13
"SCULLY:    (whisper)   Oh, god.  ",6,13
SCULLY:    Mike. Mike.  What happened to you?  ,6,13
SCULLY:    Why?  ,6,13
SCULLY:    What are you talking about?  Who's downstairs?  ,6,13
SCULLY:    Mike...  who did this to you?  ,6,13
"SCULLY:    Stop what, Mike?  ",6,13
"SCULLY:    (calming tone)  Mike, listen, settle down.  Okay.  Just give me my gun.  I'm a federal agent...  ",6,13
"SCULLY:    Mike, just give me the gun.  Give me...  ",6,13
SCULLY:    (in the closet)   Mulder?  ,6,13
"SCULLY:    (in the closet, relieved)  Mulder?  ",6,13
"SCULLY:    (in the closet)   Mulder, it was here.  ",6,13
SCULLY:    (in the closet)   Mulder!  ,6,13
"SCULLY:    (voiceover)    Several residents of the falls  have now come forward to blame  the  deaths in the neighborhood  on Home Owner Association President Gene Gogolak.  These same residents deny Agent Mulder's allegations that they were in some sense all responsible  for the demise of Gogolak himself claiming ignorance as to what actually killed him.  It would seem the code of silence  that hid the sins of this community has not only survived but-- in its creator-- claimed a final victim.  Meanwhile, the Falls at Arcadia has been named one of the top planned communities in California for the sixth year running.  ",6,13
SCULLY:    Special Agent Dana Scully.  ,6,14
SCULLY:    Out where?  ,6,14
SCULLY:    (drying her hands on a paper towel)  What he means is I don't hear a story about a sea monster and automatically assume it's the Lord's gospel truth.  ,6,14
"SCULLY:    Apparently, so does Mr. Dales.  ",6,14
"SCULLY:    Look, Mr. Dales, I'm sure that there is good reason for your alarm. I listened to the message that you left for Agent Mulder about your friends.  ",6,14
"SCULLY:    In the bathroom, you said?  ",6,14
SCULLY:    (skeptical)   And you have no reason to doubt Ms. Shipley's report?  ,6,14
"SCULLY:     What is it that brought you out here in the first place, Mr. Dales?  ",6,14
SCULLY:    At least it looks like they had the time and the presence of mind to prepare for the hurricane.  ,6,14
SCULLY:    Hello!  Mrs. Shipley!  ,6,14
SCULLY:    Mulder... No sign of life.  ,6,14
SCULLY:    How the hell did the cat get in the washing machine?  ,6,14
SCULLY:    Where do you think this leads to?  ,6,14
SCULLY:    (calling into the bathroom)  Mr. Shipley!  ,6,14
"SCULLY:    Sir, we're Agents Scully and Mulder.   I can show you my ba - ...  ",6,14
"SCULLY:    Well, what else would we be doing out here on a night like this?  ",6,14
SCULLY:    (holding up her badge)   Deputy...  ,6,14
SCULLY:    I'll be in the car.  ,6,14
SCULLY:  (on phone)    Yeah.  No...  Thank you.  (hangs up)  ,6,14
"SCULLY:    Great. Mulder, they're threatening to close the airport.  I think we better get out of here.  ",6,14
"SCULLY:    Yes, I'm curious, Mulder but I'm also suspicious.  I mean, I... I think that Mr. Dales' story is fueled by more than his imagination and not much deeper than the bottom of a highball.  ",6,14
"SCULLY:    Because sea monsters can only be read about, Mulder, because they don't exist.  ",6,14
"SCULLY:    You know what? Maybe you are a member of the Manson family. (MULDER smiles at her.)  Mulder, look-- there is nothing more for us to do here.  There's nothing that local law enforcement can't do for us.  I mean, these people are missing.  There's nowhere else to look.  I've done my duty for-for Mr. Dales for my conscience...  I mean, haven't you?  ",6,14
SCULLY:    This is an emergency.  ,6,14
"SCULLY:    Well, what about the airport?  Is there an alternate route?  ",6,14
"SCULLY:    Sir, it's important that we evacuate the area.  We're FBI agents and we need to get to where we're going.  ",6,14
SCULLY:    I'd be happy to show you my I.D  ,6,14
SCULLY:    Mulder.  ,6,14
SCULLY:    (speaking loudly into her cell phone)  Hello?  ,6,14
"SCULLY:    (on phone)   Is this the Collier County Sheriff?  Yes. Oh, hi. We're driving on, uh...  ",6,14
"SCULLY:  (on phone)    Nance Road.  (listens for a moment and looks pointedly at MULDER)  No, it isn't very smart, is it?  (MULDER squinches his faces and sarcastically imitates her nagging)  No... Yes, that would be much appreciated.  (to MULDER)  He's going to guide us to the nearest emergency shelter.  ",6,14
SCULLY:  (on phone)    Hello? Hello...  (hangs up in disgust)   No service.  ,6,14
SCULLY:    I don't need my mettle tested.  ,6,14
SCULLY:    What was that?  ,6,14
"SCULLY:    Mulder, we have to pull over.  We have to wait out this storm somewhere away from the trees.  ",6,14
SCULLY:    We don't know where we are and we don't know where we're going.  ,6,14
"SCULLY:    Deputy?  Hello?  Anybody... Mulder, he's in here.  ",6,14
SCULLY:    Can you talk to me?  ,6,14
SCULLY:    You're having trouble breathing? This man needs a trach or he's going to die real soon.  ,6,14
"SCULLY:    Mulder, I need you to hold his head real steady.  (MULDER is not thrilled.)  Deputy, if you can hear me, just try and relax.  Okay.  Here we go.  ",6,14
SCULLY:    I don't know but he's having a reaction which is affecting his autonomic response.  ,6,14
SCULLY:    All I know is we have to get a medivac unit out here as soon as possible.  ,6,14
SCULLY:    (into DEPUTY GREER's radio)   This is Special Agent Dana Scully with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  I need a medivac unit out here ASAP.  ,6,14
"SCULLY:    (voice, on radio)   I have an officer in need of emergency medical assistance.  ",6,14
SCULLY:    (voice on radio)   My name is Dana... Scully.  ,6,14
SCULLY:    (voice on radio)   I'm a medical doctor requesting a medivac unit for a sheriff's deputy who is injured.  ,6,14
SCULLY:    (voice on radio)   I have a deputy who's been attacked by something as yet unidentified.  ,6,14
"SCULLY:    (voice on radio)   His vitals are weak and he's in shock.  Now, I need him taken to a hospital right away.  ",6,14
SCULLY:    He's had some kind of foreign organism released into his body.  His condition's worsening.  ,6,14
SCULLY:    I don't know.  It may have been some kind of a water-borne parasite.  ,6,14
SCULLY:    I'm sorry. I don't know who Harry is.  ,6,14
SCULLY:    He may have evacuated.  ,6,14
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,6,14
SCULLY:    We can't.  ,6,14
"SCULLY:    Mulder, I just got off the radio. They won't even chance sending a rescue vehicle at this time.  The roads are impassable, and I don't even know if the deputy is movable in this condition.  ",6,14
SCULLY:    It looks that way.  At least until the weather breaks.  ,6,14
"SCULLY:    I don't think these wounds are bites or stings.  There's something in here, Mulder,  right under the skin.  Tongs. (ANGELA passes some kitchen tongs to her.)   Mulder, what's his temperature?  ",6,14
"SCULLY:    (also looking at the thermometer)   You're not far off.  It's 106. Okay, somebody fill the tub with cold water and find as much ice as they can in the freezer.  ",6,14
"SCULLY:    Yeah, well, it may be but unless we get his temperature down he's not going to survive this.  Now get moving.  ",6,14
SCULLY:    We need to put this man in ice water as soon as possible.  ,6,14
"SCULLY:    I need a container.  Mulder, lift him up.  We have to get him into the tub.  ",6,14
SCULLY:    All that happened here is a sewage pipe burst.  ,6,14
"SCULLY:    Look, you guys, whatever this thing is there's no evidence yet that it's going to kill anybody.  ",6,14
"SCULLY:    The man in the bathtub may very well be saved if he can just last out this storm.  In fact, we may all be safe if we just remain calm.  ",6,14
SCULLY:    How is he?  ,6,14
SCULLY:    (handing ANGELA a bucket)   We'll be waiting for you out here.  ,6,14
"SCULLY:    Mulder, nothing I've seen convinces me there's a monster   ",6,14
"SCULLY:    Mulder, there is no evidence of any creature here.  Those organisms might just simply be waterborne parasites, but something from Jules Verne they are not.  ",6,14
SCULLY:    Mulder?  ,6,14
SCULLY:    It's gone?  ,6,14
SCULLY:    Where'd he go?  ,6,14
"SCULLY:    Mulder, if that were true then this wouldn't be visible, would it? (She holds up a glass jar with the worm thing from the deputy's neck floating in water.)  I mean, what this is showing us is that water actually attempts to kill it.  ",6,14
"SCULLY:    Mulder, the Shipleys weren't even in their house.  ",6,14
SCULLY:     We're in the middle of a hurricane.  ,6,14
"SCULLY:    Mulder, we cant.  There's no way we can transport everybody.  ",6,14
SCULLY:    Mulder?  ,6,14
"SCULLY:    Mulder, if we're going to leave we should leave now.  ",6,14
"SCULLY:    Mulder?!  Hey, Mulder, are you okay?  ",6,14
SCULLY:    Hey... wait a second.  What are you doing?!  ,6,14
SCULLY:    That's my partner out there!  ,6,14
SCULLY:    You can't just leave him there!  ,6,14
SCULLY:    He'll die!  ,6,14
"SCULLY:    Well, I can at least keep him breathing!  ",6,14
"SCULLY:    Look, at least let me try.  I'm a medical doctor.  ",6,14
SCULLY:    (heading to kitchen)  We're going to need water.  If I'm going to deliver this baby you can put that gun down.  (she puts on another pair of gloves)  ,6,14
SCULLY:    You don't.  The truth is I've never delivered a baby before.  So stand back or make yourself useful but stay out of my way.  ,6,14
"SCULLY:    You got it.  Breathe... Breathe.  Okay, Angela,  I'm going to need you to push, okay?  I need you to help me help you.  Okay. So let's push.  ",6,14
"SCULLY:    You got it.  You got it.  You're on the right track.  (to GEORGE) I'm going to need some towels,  please.  ",6,14
"SCULLY:    (demanding)  I need some towels, damn it!  ",6,14
"SCULLY:    You're doing good.  You're doing good. Okay.  You're doing good. Okay. Let's go.  Okay, push.  ",6,14
SCULLY:    I can feel it up there!  ,6,14
"SCULLY:    Okay, come on.  Puuush!  Good!  You got it.  Okay.  Here it comes.  ",6,14
SCULLY:    Here it comes.  It's coming.  Okay.  ,6,14
SCULLY:    It's the water.  ,6,14
SCULLY:    It's the water!  ,6,14
SCULLY:    Okay!  ,6,14
SCULLY:    Push!  ,6,14
SCULLY:    It's coming! Push!  Push!  ,6,14
SCULLY:    Okay!  ,6,14
"SCULLY:    (to WALTER)   Okay, now pick up the gun.  ",6,14
SCULLY:    (holding the baby)   Pick up the gun!  ,6,14
SCULLY:    Shoot out the sprinklers!  Just point and shoot!  Shoot out the sprinklers!  ,6,14
"SCULLY:    Well, it's official.  Ten pounds, ten ounces of piss and vinegar. El nino grande--  Leroy Walter Villareal Suarez, Jr.  ",6,14
"SCULLY:    Oh, yes.  ",6,14
SCULLY:    What's that?  ,6,14
"SCULLY:    (rationalizing)   Well, you wouldn't have known to go out in the rain if I hadn't pointed it out that to you that it was the fresh water that killed the organism...  ",6,14
"SCULLY:    (quietly desperate)  You're in charge here, you know.  It doesn't have to end like this.  ",6,15
SCULLY:    (screaming)  Nooooooo!!!!  ,6,15
SCULLY:    You didn't miss the meeting.  You're extraordinarily late for the meeting.  It's still going on.  ,6,15
"SCULLY:    We took a short break and I came looking for you.  What are you doing down here, Mulder?  ",6,15
"SCULLY:    Since I've been working here? Yeah.  When did you get a waterbed, Mulder?  ",6,15
SCULLY:    (to herself)   When do I not?  ,6,15
SCULLY:    Drop it!  Drop it now!  ,6,15
SCULLY:    They're not going to call.  What's your name?  ,6,15
"SCULLY:    Look, I got to call you something, right?  How about Steve?  It's a nice... honest name.  Steve.  ",6,15
SCULLY:    (voice breaking)  Bernard.  I have to get my partner out of here.  ,6,15
"SCULLY:    Oh... look, they don't know that.  Don't you realize that?  They can't see you.  They don't know what your plan is.  ",6,15
SCULLY:    Look... just walk in front of the door and show them.  ,6,15
SCULLY:    (quietly pleading)   I just want everybody to live.  That's all.  I just... just show them.  You have control over everything that happens here. You do.  And it doesn't have to end this way.  ,6,15
SCULLY:    (screams)   Noooooo!!!!  ,6,15
"SCULLY:    Well, not yet, but, uh, only because it's the longest in FBI history.  ",6,15
"SCULLY:    Well, I came looking for you.  We took a five-minute break (looks at watch)   three minutes ago.  Mulder, your cell phone's not working.  (He glances up at her.)  Did you oversleep?  ",6,15
"SCULLY:    Yes. Frequently.  But, I mean, who's   who's to say that if you did rewind it and start over again that it wouldn't end up exactly the same way?  ",6,15
"SCULLY:    No, I think that we're free to be the people that we are-- good, bad or indifferent.  I think that it's our character that determines our fate.  ",6,15
SCULLY:    Since when did you get a waterbed?  ,6,15
SCULLY:    Fate.  ,6,15
"SCULLY:    Then let's change yours.  I will deposit your check.  You gather your files, go to Skinner's office, give your report before he takes it out on both of us.  ",6,15
SCULLY:   Drop it.  ,6,15
"SCULLY:    Bernard, she's not dead.  You're not a murderer yet.  ",6,15
SCULLY:    Yes?  ,6,15
SCULLY:    The bank?  ,6,15
SCULLY:    Uh... I'm not following.  Did-did you get separated from your tour?  ,6,15
SCULLY:    Um... I'm sorry...  ,6,15
SCULLY:    Hey.  ,6,15
"SCULLY:    Huh? No.  No, we, uh, took a five-minute break about, uh, three minutes ago.  Uh, Mulder, your cell phone's not working.  ",6,15
SCULLY:    What?  ,6,15
"SCULLY:    Well, that's fairly common.  ",6,15
"SCULLY:    Well, you may have.  Did you do a lot of drinking in college?  ",6,15
"SCULLY:    Mulder, I don't see why it has to mean anything.  ",6,15
SCULLY:    Set what kind of things right?  ,6,15
"SCULLY:    Mulder, it's more likely that we're talking about simple neurochemistry-- a glitch in the brain's ability to process recognition and memory.  Doesn't mean that the memory's authentic.  ",6,15
SCULLY:    What if you'd lived this moment before and now you're living it again?  ,6,15
"SCULLY:    Well, right now I'd say you're fated to go to this meeting.  ",6,15
SCULLY:    Mulder... what bank?  ,6,15
SCULLY:    Eighth Street.  ,6,15
SCULLY:    (sighs)   Some ... some woman just stopped me in the hallway not ten minutes ago. She knew both of our names and she warned against either of us entering into the Cradock branch on Eighth Street.  She said that we'd die.  ,6,15
"SCULLY:    Five-eight, thin, green eyes, dyed hair.  M-maybe you know her. Maybe... it's just somebody pulling a prank.  ",6,15
SCULLY:    You didn't miss the meeting.  You're extraordinarily late for the meeting.  ,6,15
SCULLY:    Excuse me.  ,6,15
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   Mulder, where are you?  ",6,15
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   Yeah, I know where you are, but what's taking so long?  ",6,15
"SCULLY:    Ma'am, will you come with me?  ",6,15
"SCULLY:    Just come with me, please.  ",6,15
SCULLY:    My partner said you'd know.  ,6,15
SCULLY:    Drop it!  ,6,15
SCULLY:    Drop it now!  ,6,15
SCULLY:   (on phone)   This is Agent Dana Scully with the FBI  ,6,15
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   Mulder, it's me.  ",6,15
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   No, not yet but Skinner wants to see us in his office as soon as possible. He's asking for our report on the robbery yesterday.  ",6,15
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   I'd like to hear it, too.  ",6,15
SCULLY:   (on phone)   That's not what I mean.  You still won't explain what happened yesterday--  how you knew that Bernard Oates was strapped with explosives.  ,6,15
SCULLY:   (on phone)   And it was also a feeling that he had an accomplice waiting in the car?  ,6,15
SCULLY:   (on phone)   Are you okay?  ,6,15
SCULLY:    Aren't you going home?  ,6,16
SCULLY:    What you got?  ,6,16
SCULLY:    You mind if I ask the cause of death?  ,6,16
SCULLY:    From what?  ,6,16
"SCULLY:    A dog?   A ""dog"" dog?  ",6,16
SCULLY:    (looking through the file)   What happened to the dog?  ,6,16
"SCULLY:    Yeah, I got it.  Did anybody, um, examine the victims, Mulder?  ",6,16
"SCULLY:    Look, bite wounds are rarely lethal in themselves.  I mean, they are not the cause of death.  They lead to it through the loss of blood, but, uh... it makes you wonder how accurate this report is.  ",6,16
"SCULLY:    Mulder, I don't have to tell you how absolutely and completely wrong that seems.  I mean, they were found dead in a locked cage, right?  ",6,16
SCULLY:    Two grown men?  ,6,16
SCULLY:    (stares at him)   You're not going to tell me that a dog did this.  ,6,16
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,6,16
SCULLY:    (looking in the crate)   What did you find?  ,6,16
SCULLY:    I don't suppose you can tell us what kind of dog this is.  ,6,16
SCULLY:    (interrupting)   Don't mind him.  He'll go on forever.  Did you have a chance to talk to this Dr. Detweiler?  ,6,16
SCULLY:    A breed of what?  ,6,16
SCULLY:    And you have one of these?  ,6,16
"SCULLY:    Jake Conroy, age 30.  He was employed as a customs agent by the Federal Government.  The bite marks match those of the victims on the Chinese freighter.  In this case, it bit off the man's hand.  There's some talk in the house that he may be involved in the theft of the animal and that it turned on him.  ",6,16
"SCULLY:    Well, it does make sense.  I mean, a victim and his dog are attacked inside of a house with all the doors shut.  It couldn't have happened unless the dog was being kept inside.  ",6,16
"SCULLY:    Well, then what?  ",6,16
SCULLY:    You mean covering up crime scenes?  ,6,16
"SCULLY:    So, you're talking about a dog that has human intelligence. (MULDER looks innocent.)  Well, even if there were such an animal where would we even begin to look for one?  ",6,16
"SCULLY:    (glancing up at MULDER)  Yeah, he doesn't listen and he chews on the furniture.  ",6,16
SCULLY:    You sure this woman's not an authority on bats?  ,6,16
SCULLY:    How is it that you know so much about her but you don't know what she looks like?  ,6,16
SCULLY:    But you assume that she's going to help us?  ,6,16
"SCULLY:    (curious)  Oh, so you two are chummy?  ",6,16
SCULLY:    (reading some of the titles)  Ah. The Wolf Inside...  Dogs Don't Lie...  Better Than Human...  Better Than Human?  ,6,16
"SCULLY:    Well, she seems to have made a connection to you.  ",6,16
SCULLY:    Intelligence enough to murder?  ,6,16
SCULLY:    What about a Dhole?  ,6,16
SCULLY:    Mulder... She's a friend of yours?  ,6,16
SCULLY:    On-line...  ,6,16
SCULLY:    Is it the same dog?  ,6,16
SCULLY:    (quietly to MULDER)   I don't think wolfwoman is here to speak to me about this.  I'll take a look at the body.  ,6,16
SCULLY:    Did they tell you anything?  ,6,16
SCULLY:    And that's what you think the print indicates?  ,6,16
"SCULLY:    Just yesterday you dismissed the possibility outright, that a dog or a... a canid, as you call it, would behave like this.  ",6,16
SCULLY:    But you'll accept the idea that it behaves in every other way like Jack the Ripper.  ,6,16
"SCULLY:    (looking directly at her, then at MULDER)   Oh, I'm... fairly certain there is.  ",6,16
"SCULLY:    How well do you know this woman, Mulder?  ",6,16
"SCULLY:  Well,  I question her motives.  ",6,16
"SCULLY:    She's enamored of you, Mulder.  Don't underestimate a woman. They can be tricksters, too.  ",6,16
"SCULLY:    I'm a federal agent.  I'm armed.  If you can hear me, don't move. Just stay where you are and tell me if you're okay.  ",6,16
SCULLY:    Mulder?  ,6,16
SCULLY:    Come take a look at this.  ,6,16
SCULLY:    I'll call the paramedics.  ,6,16
SCULLY:    Continuing his investigation.  ,6,16
SCULLY:    No. This is my investigation.  ,6,16
SCULLY:    You.  ,6,16
"SCULLY:    I thought at first that they were eccentricities or affectations-- the dark, the clothes-- but it's photosensitivity.  Your sleeves cover up skin lesions.  It's why you're here amongst the humans instead of out in the field. Systemic lupus erythematosus.  ",6,16
SCULLY:    Ironic or perverse?  ,6,16
"SCULLY:    But not with Mulder.  With Mulder, you found somebody you could communicate with.... someone who challenged you... But that wasn't enough. You needed to lure him out here.  ",6,16
"SCULLY:    (looks away for a moment)   You don't believe it, do you-- not for a minute-- that there's an animal out there killing?  ",6,16
SCULLY:    More cunning than you?  ,6,16
SCULLY:    (warning)  I'm watching you.  ,6,16
SCULLY:    (not pleased)   Now tell me why you pulled me away from the suspect and chained me to this chair 'cause I haven't seen hide nor hair of Detweiler since I've been here.  ,6,16
SCULLY:    What do you mean?  ,6,16
SCULLY:    (warning)    Mulder...  ,6,16
"SCULLY:    So, what is he going to do?  Walk in here, skitter across the linoleum and pee in the corners?  ",6,16
"SCULLY:    Mulder, the only thing Karin Berquist is interested in is you.  ",6,16
SCULLY:    You're kidding yourself if you think that she hasn't manipulated this entire situation for her own purposes.  ,6,16
"SCULLY:    Well, you've got no argument from me.  ",6,16
SCULLY:    Mulder...  ,6,16
SCULLY:    You going home?  ,6,16
SCULLY:    You think this is your fault.  ,6,16
SCULLY:    Why wouldn't you believe her?  ,6,16
"SCULLY:   (gently)   Well, she had a lot of secrets, that's for sure.  I think that Karin Berquist lived by her instincts.  She sized people up pretty quickly and I think she figured you out to a ""T."" (MULDER looks up at her.) I think she saw in you a kindred spirit, Mulder.  She may not have been able to express that to you.  Maybe what she did was the highest form of compliment.  ",6,16
SCULLY:    You going to be okay?  ,6,16
SCULLY:    Oh.  This came for you.  ,6,16
SCULLY:    Should we arrest David Copperfield?  ,6,17
"SCULLY:    Well, maybe he was killed elsewhere.  ",6,17
"SCULLY:    I don't know.  It's, uh... it's not a simple bisection.  There's a considerable amount of his abdomen missing.  I mean, it almost looks like a burning but it's too localized.  Maybe an industrial acid.  ",6,17
SCULLY:    Oh.  (long pause)  Spontaneous human combustion.  ,6,17
"SCULLY:    Well, isn't that where you're going with this?  ",6,17
"SCULLY:    Mulder, there are one or two somewhat well-documented cases.  ",6,17
"SCULLY:    Mulder, shut up.  ",6,17
SCULLY:    Okay. What do you make of this?  ,6,17
SCULLY:    And who is Pinker Rawls?  ,6,17
SCULLY:    So you're saying that a ghost did this?  ,6,17
SCULLY:    So we're looking for a dead man?  ,6,17
"SCULLY:    Okay. Well, at the risk of further ridicule, Mulder, what if this wasn't a murder?  I mean as I understand it, current theory on spontaneous human combustion is that climatic conditions play a large part.  So, possibly a tornado may fit the bill.  We've got lightning, um, static electricity at a high potential.  ",6,17
"SCULLY:    Well, then how did Rawls or whoever do this?  How did he get in and out of a locked office and prop a body up against the inside of a door?  ",6,17
"SCULLY:    (reading his file)   Wilson Pinker Rawls, age 34.  Eight years into 30 for robbing a wire office in Bay Saint Louis.  The $90,000 he stole was never recovered.  ",6,17
SCULLY:    (ignoring him)   His record dates to 1978.  Mostly small-time. History of violence throughout.  ,6,17
SCULLY:    Whoever he was.  ,6,17
SCULLY:    Mulder.  ,6,17
"SCULLY:    Oh, my god.  ",6,17
"SCULLY:    Pistol in his hand, slide locked open, shell casings everywhere. I don't see any bullet holes anywhere, Mulder.  ",6,17
SCULLY:    Bo Merkle.  This is his house.  ,6,17
"SCULLY:    $90,000.  The wire office robbery eight years ago.  The money hasn't been recovered.  ",6,17
"SCULLY:    I don't think Mr. Merkle did either, judging by the decor.  ",6,17
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,6,17
SCULLY:    (taking out her phone)   I can run down the name.  ,6,17
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   Yeah, this is Special Agent Dana Scully with the FBI. There's been a murder here at 922 Washington Avenue in Jackson.  I need crime scene support on-site as soon as possible.  Thank you.  Oh, and could you transfer me to the records division, please?  ",6,17
"SCULLY:    Got a name to go with the face.   June Gurwitch.  There's no current address, though and, uh, no record of her since 1996.  ",6,17
SCULLY:    The state police have put out an APB on Rawls.  ,6,17
"SCULLY:    Look, Mulder, even if those were bullets...  ",6,17
"SCULLY:    Even if these were bullets, there is no way that they could pass through Rawls in the way that you're describing-not, not without leaving him sprawled dead on the ground for us to find.  ",6,17
SCULLY:    He walks through solid objects?  ,6,17
SCULLY:    And flesh into carbon.  ,6,17
"SCULLY:    But where's the science in all of this, Mulder?  You're talking alchemy.  ",6,17
SCULLY:    I'm sorry I even brought it up.  ,6,17
SCULLY:    June Gurwitch.  ,6,17
"SCULLY:    She has a sister named Jackie, and I have the address.  ",6,17
SCULLY:    Jackie Gurwitch?  FBI!  ,6,17
"SCULLY:    Her son's spending the night at a friend's house and she's going to meet them there.  She said that she didn't tell Rawls where her sister was.  (hard for her to say)   Mulder, she said that he walked right through the wall.  ",6,17
SCULLY:    Maybe he left on foot or he stole another car.  ,6,17
"SCULLY:    Well, maybe he's still in the neighborhood.  I think the, uh, local PD can search but we have to get going.  ",6,17
SCULLY:    To Meridian.  That's where June Gurwitch lives... or June Burdett as she's now called.  ,6,17
"SCULLY:    (showing badge)   Agents Scully and Mulder with the FBI.  We are looking for June Gurwitch, also  known as June Burdett.  ",6,17
SCULLY:    An escaped convict by the name of Wilson Pinker Rawls-- we believe that he may be pursuing Ms. Gurwitch with the intention of harming her.  ,6,17
SCULLY:    They're fine.  ,6,17
SCULLY:    So you took it.  ,6,17
SCULLY:    It's best you both stay under 24-hour guard until Rawls is apprehended.  It's for your protection.  ,6,17
"SCULLY:    Don't discuss this with anyone, Mr. Werther.  ",6,17
SCULLY:    Rawls was in the trunk?  ,6,17
SCULLY:    (from another room)  Mulder?  ,6,17
SCULLY:    He stopped at the mirror.  ,6,17
SCULLY:    Electrostatic repulsion.  Individual electrons repelling one another like magnets.  ,6,17
"SCULLY:    Resistance against electrical current.  A good insulator like rubber, like glass.  ",6,17
"SCULLY:    Say... say that your theory is correct- that he can walk through walls.  Why go through all this effort over an old robbery score?  It's $90,000-- he could get that anywhere, right?  ",6,17
SCULLY:    Yet he turned this place upside down which means he was looking for something.  And I think it has to do with this.  (showing him a bill) It's a lien on unpaid hospital bills dating back to 1992 and the patient name is June Gurwitch.  And this is an IC D-9 number-- a hospital diagnostic code.  This particular one means...  ,6,17
"SCULLY:    Right.  Specifically, c-section.  ",6,17
"SCULLY:    Uh-huh.  ""I want what's mine.""  This man is looking for his child, Mulder.  ",6,17
SCULLY:    He has to intend for June to lead him to his child.  ,6,17
"SCULLY:    Yeah, but where?  We don't have a name or an address.  I mean, June may not either, for that matter.  If the child was  was adopted... I think our best bet is to go through state records but it's going to take some time.  ",6,17
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   Yeah, can you also check her alias, please?  It's Burdett, B-u-r-d-e-t-t.   ",6,17
"SCULLY:    (on phone)   All right, thank you very much.  (she hangs up and turns to MULDER)   No match on Burdett or Gurwitch.  ",6,17
SCULLY:    Sealed files?  ,6,17
"SCULLY:    Well, maybe she didn't go through official channels.  Maybe the kid's with a friend or a relative somewhere.  ",6,17
SCULLY:    Okay... Everything's going to be all right.  We're going to get you to a safe place.  ,6,17
SCULLY:    Let's go.  Run. Run. Run.  Get inside. Get inside.  Get inside. Get inside.  ,6,17
SCULLY:    No!  ,6,17
"SCULLY:    I, uh... I rode up on the elevator with someone. Someone from next door, I think.  ",6,18
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,6,18
SCULLY:    You met him?  ,6,18
SCULLY:    What does he write?  ,6,18
"SCULLY:    As you can see the heart was removed in the same manner as the previous victim.  No incisions, no scope marks, no cutting of any kind.  ",6,18
"SCULLY:    No. There's no prints, no DNA material, no hair and fiber.  ",6,18
"SCULLY:    Mulder, psychic surgery is some man dipping his hand in a bucket of chicken guts and pretending to remove tumors from the sick and gullible.  ",6,18
"SCULLY:    Well, medicine, as you're referring to it is about keeping people alive.  ",6,18
SCULLY:    I don't know.  I have no idea.  ,6,18
"SCULLY:    Well, a crime is only as perfect as the man or the mind that commits it.  Even if it were perfect-- even if he made not one mistake-- there's still his motive.  You find his motive and you find the murderer.  ",6,18
SCULLY:   (on phone)   Scully.  ,6,18
SCULLY:   (on phone)   Are you sure?  ,6,18
SCULLY:   (on phone)   I'm not sure that I could.  Did anybody see anybody?  ,6,18
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   Well, there's got to be something, Mulder...  ",6,18
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   Something about his victims-- why he chooses them, a pattern.  ",6,18
SCULLY:   (on phone)   An envelope's been slipped under your door.  ,6,18
SCULLY:   (on phone)   It's unmarked.  ,6,18
SCULLY:   (on phone)   It's some kind of a pendant.  Like a charm.  ,6,18
"SCULLY:    It's called a ""milagro.""  That's the Spanish word for ""miracle."" It's worn as a lucky charm.  ",6,18
"SCULLY:    It was dropped off at reception by a man in his late 20s, early 30s... average looking, average build.  They weren't able to get a good ID.  There are no fingerprints and no DNA from his saliva.  ",6,18
SCULLY:    Did you see that it's a burning heart?  ,6,18
"SCULLY:    Well, maybe it has something to do with his next victim. Maybe he's taunting you.  ",6,18
SCULLY:    I think I'll check it out.  ,6,18
SCULLY:    Thank you for making my schedule but I think I'm going to have to be late for that appointment.  ,6,18
SCULLY:    Why are you telling me this?  ,6,18
SCULLY:    Yes.  How did you know that?  ,6,18
SCULLY:    I know you.  You live next to somebody I work with. Why are you following me?  ,6,18
SCULLY:    You imagined it.  ,6,18
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,6,18
SCULLY:    That was from you?  ,6,18
"SCULLY:    Yeah, and I don't know you now and I don't care to.  ",6,18
SCULLY:    I'm sorry.  ,6,18
SCULLY:    I was doing some research and learning that I owe you an apology.  ,6,18
SCULLY:    The Milagro charm-- you were right about its insignificance.  ,6,18
"SCULLY:   (holding up the charm)  Mulder, this... is nothing more than a tool used by a lovelorn Romeo who just happens to be your next-door neighbor.  ",6,18
SCULLY:    Yes-- my secret admirer who claims to know the mysteries of my heart.  ,6,18
"SCULLY:    No, I wish I were.  He cornered me today and told me my life story.  It was kind of frightening, actually.  ",6,18
"SCULLY:    No.  ""Frightening"" as in too much information and intimate detail. What kills you is his audacity.  MULDER:     Did you get his name?  ",6,18
"SCULLY:    (challenging)  No, but that shouldn't be too hard to find out, should it?  ",6,18
"SCULLY:    Hi.  I, um... I was going next door and I thought that I'd return this.  ",6,18
SCULLY:    Because I can't return the gesture.  (pause)  I can't.  ,6,18
SCULLY:    You don't have any furniture.  ,6,18
SCULLY:    You don't eat?  ,6,18
SCULLY:    Writing your books?  ,6,18
SCULLY:    Anything I'd know?  ,6,18
"SCULLY:    Why now, all of a sudden?  ",6,18
"SCULLY:    Well, you lead a curious life.  ",6,18
SCULLY:    (looks away)   Loneliness is a choice.  ,6,18
"SCULLY:   (quietly)    My life's not so lonely,  Mister, um...  ",6,18
SCULLY:    It's actually anything but.  ,6,18
"SCULLY:    How is it you think you know me so well, Mr. Padgett?  ",6,18
SCULLY:    Right.  (realizes he is serious)   Since when?  ,6,18
SCULLY:    And you moved into this building by coincidence?  ,6,18
SCULLY:    You moved here because of me?  ,6,18
SCULLY:    (looking at the thick manuscript)  This is all about me?  ,6,18
SCULLY:    May I read it?  ,6,18
SCULLY:    You don't have anywhere to sit.  ,6,18
SCULLY:    (reluctantly)  I'm due next door.  ,6,18
SCULLY:    I'm very uncomfortable with this.  ,6,18
SCULLY:    If you know me so well then why am I standing here when my instincts tell me to go?  ,6,18
SCULLY:    Mulder!  ,6,18
SCULLY:    What are you doing?  ,6,18
SCULLY:    (pointed)  Yes.  ,6,18
SCULLY:    Mulder... what are you doing?  ,6,18
"SCULLY:    (softly, warning)   Mulder.  Not without his lawyer.  ",6,18
SCULLY:    (softly)   Mulder.  ,6,18
"SCULLY:    Mulder, where are you going?  ",6,18
"SCULLY:    (holding up a folder)   I did that.  That's what I've been doing. Dr. Ken Naciamento, Sao Paulo, Brazil, emigrated here in 1996.  ",6,18
SCULLY:    He's dead.  ,6,18
"SCULLY:    Two years dead, Mulder.  I'm having them fax me a certificate of death.  ",6,18
"SCULLY:    Well, maybe he didn't do it at all.  ",6,18
"SCULLY:    Maybe he imagined it, like he said.  Like Shakespeare or Freud or- or Jung.  I mean, maybe, maybe he has some gift and he has a clear window into human nature.  ",6,18
"SCULLY:    Well, isn't that what you do, Mulder, as a behavioral profiler? You  you imagine the killer's mind so well that you know what they're going to do next.  ",6,18
SCULLY:    (uncomfortably)   I read a chapter.  What does he say?  ,6,18
"SCULLY:    (short laugh, not looking at him)   I think you know me better than that, Mulder.  ",6,18
SCULLY:    What is it?  ,6,18
"SCULLY:    (reading, voiceover)   Grief squeezed at her eggshell heart like it might break into a thousand pieces its contents running like broken promises into the hollow places his love used to fill.  ",6,18
"SCULLY:    (voiceover)   How could she know this pain would end? That love, unlike matter or energy, was in endless supply in the universe... A germ which grows from nothingness which cannot be eradicated even from the darkest of hearts.  If she had known this-- and who could say she would believe it?-- She would not have chanced to remain at his sad grave until such an hour so that she might not have to learn the second truth before the first: that to have love was to carry a vessel that could be lost or stolen or worse, spilled blood-red on the ground. And that love was not immutable and could become hate as day becomes night as life becomes death.  ",6,18
SCULLY:    She's a no-show at home or anywhere else she might go.  ,6,18
"SCULLY:    Maybe his statement's to prove that he's telling the truth-- that he truly just imagined it, Mulder.  ",6,18
"SCULLY:    Mulder, that's not him.  ",6,18
SCULLY:    Mulder.  ,6,18
"SCULLY:    Mulder, he works here.  ",6,18
"SCULLY:    How did you know, Mulder, that the body was in the truck?  ",6,18
SCULLY:    It's still no evidence that Padgett directed the killer.  ,6,18
"SCULLY:    Mulder, you are making critical assumptions without any facts.  What about time of death?  What...?  ",6,18
SCULLY:    What are you doing?  ,6,18
"SCULLY:    Mulder, why couldn't he have imagined it? Why couldn't he just be in the killer's head?  ",6,18
"SCULLY:    (looking away)  Mulder, of course not.  ",6,18
SCULLY:    No. He's just sitting there.  Staring.  ,6,18
SCULLY:    He just started typing again.  ,6,18
"SCULLY:    Yeah, Scully.  ",6,19
"SCULLY:    Mulder, what time is it?  ",6,19
SCULLY:    Las Vegas?  Why?  ,6,19
"SCULLY:    What, exactly?  ",6,19
"SCULLY:    Yeah, I trust you, Mulder, it's the Three Stooges I'm not so sure about.  ",6,19
"SCULLY:    Okay.  Okay, okay.  Okay.  ",6,19
"SCULLY:    Could you, uh, take this up, please?  ",6,19
"SCULLY:    Where's Agent Mulder, I've been trying to call him.  ",6,19
"SCULLY:    By all means, bring me up to speed.  ",6,19
SCULLY:    You know this man?  ,6,19

"SCULLY:    I don't care.  Mulder, this is a needle in a haystack.  These poor souls have been dead for 50 years.  Let them rest in peace.  Let sleeping dogs lie.  ",6,20
SCULLY:    Necessity is the mother of invention.  ,6,20
"SCULLY:    (taking another bite)   Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we may die.  ",6,20
SCULLY:    No-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!  (delightful laugh)   Mulder!  ,6,20
SCULLY:    (accusing)   Mulder!?  You cheat. I can't believe that you've been reading about baseball this whole time.  ,6,20
"SCULLY:    (interrupting)   Boring.   Mulder, can I ask you a personal question?  ",6,20
SCULLY:    Did your mother ever tell you to go outside and play?  Mulder?  ,6,20
SCULLY:    Mulder?  ,6,20
SCULLY:    You just defaced property of the U.S. Government.  ,6,20
SCULLY:    You rebel.  ,6,20
"SCULLY:    So, uh... I get this message marked ""urgent"" on my answering service from one Fox Mantle telling me to come down to the park for a very special very early or very late birthday present.  And, Mulder... I don't see any nicely wrapped presents lying around so, what gives?  ",6,20
"SCULLY:    No, I guess I have, uh... found more necessary things to do with my time than ... (a foul ball hits the fence)   slap a piece of horsehide with a stick.  ",6,20
"SCULLY:    (warily, not thrilled)  This my birthday present, Mulder? You shouldn't have.  ",6,20
SCULLY:    Okay.  ,6,20
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,6,20
SCULLY:    Hips before hands.  ,6,20
SCULLY:    Mm-hmm.  ,6,20
SCULLY:    I'm in the middle.  ,6,20
"SCULLY:    (with a big smile)   Shut up, Mulder.  I'm playing baseball.  ",6,20
"SCULLY:    Which rules out decomposition.   I'd say predation, but the... the bones would be scattered.  ",6,21
"SCULLY:    (not to be baited)   Right. Well, I'd say it looks like a double murder, possibly one with ritualistic overtones.  The bodies may have been stripped then skeletonized, possibly by boiling or by the use of some kind of acid solution.  Maybe the arrangement of the bodies has some meaning for the killer or killers.  But at any rate, I'd term it ""ritualistic.""  ",6,21
"SCULLY:    Well, what do you think this is?  ",6,21
SCULLY:    And what does that have to do with these two?  ,6,21
SCULLY:    UFOs.  Extraterrestrial visitors from beyond who apparently have nothing better to do than buzz one mountain over and over again for 700 years.  ,6,21
"SCULLY:    Mulder, can't you just for once, just... for the novelty of it come up with the simplest explanation, the most logical one, instead of automatically jumping to UFOs or Bigfoot or...?  ",6,21
SCULLY:    The connective tissue is more or less intact.  ,6,21
"SCULLY:    If you'll, um, pardon an obvious question are you sure that these are the right two bodies and not two others that have lain out for six months?  ",6,21
"SCULLY:    Would you, uh, happen to know what this is?  ",6,21
SCULLY:    (looking at the skeleton)  No.  You go ahead.  ,6,21
"SCULLY:    (reading)Water, hydrochloric acid... Electrolytes, pepsins and trypsins.  It's a digestive secretion.  ",6,21
SCULLY:    Chitinase?  ,6,21
SCULLY:    Both of these were discovered as skeletal remains.  ,6,21
SCULLY:    It says here that the bodies were found not far from where Angela and Wallace Schiff turned up.  ,6,21
"SCULLY:    Oh, Mulder, answer your phone.  ",6,21
SCULLY:    Do me a favor.  I want you to forward a sample of that secretion over to the FBI lab at Quantico.  I want them to run a complete analysis.  ,6,21
"SCULLY:    And, uh, in the meantime, could I borrow your truck?  ",6,21
SCULLY:    Mulder?!  ,6,21
SCULLY:    Mulder?!  Mulder!  ,6,21
SCULLY:    Mulder.  Why the hell did you leave North Carolina without telling me?  ,6,21
SCULLY:    You disappear and then I get a furtive call that you're back here in D.C.?  ,6,21
SCULLY:    No.  ,6,21
"SCULLY:    Angela... and Wallace Schiff.  But, Mulder, it can't be.  ",6,21
"SCULLY:    Mulder, I I.D.'d their remains myself.  ",6,21
SCULLY:    The aliens?  ,6,21
SCULLY:    Mulder...  ,6,21
SCULLY:    What?  ,6,21
"SCULLY:    Mulder, from what very little I understand about this case, this is not what happened to me.  ",6,21
SCULLY:    Who?  ,6,21
SCULLY:    I... I can hear him.  ,6,21
"SCULLY:    (in rapture)   Oh, my god.  ",6,21
"SCULLY:    I, uh... I don't know what to say, Mulder.  Where to begin.  I mean, you... you were right.  All these years, you were right.  ",6,21
"SCULLY:    You were right about the grays, about... about the abductions, about the UFOs... the lights, the Brown Mountain lights...  ",6,21
SCULLY:    They were... they were fake.  They were decoys.  ,6,21
SCULLY:    It was nothing.  It was bog sludge.  ,6,21
"SCULLY:    Mulder, I'm admitting that I was wrong.  ",6,21
SCULLY:    Are... are you all right?  ,6,21
SCULLY:    How are you feeling?  ,6,21
SCULLY:    What?  ,6,21
"SCULLY:    Mulder, if I, of all people, can believe this then why can't you?  ",6,21
SCULLY:    Yeah. I looked.  It's empty.  It's as if he just vanished.  ,6,21
SCULLY:    Doctor... It's more of that digestive material.  (uses a latex glove to pick up more yellow goo from some overturned dirt)  Looks like it's coming up from out of the ground.  ,6,21
SCULLY:    They were only going in before.  ,6,21
"SCULLY:    How? I mean, this, this cave's not much more than a hole in the rock.  ",6,21
"SCULLY:    (voice breaking slightly)   That, um... that digestive secretion that we keep finding-- could it, could it have done this to him?  ",6,21
"SCULLY:    (struggling, not quite crying)  Well, it's... it's chemically similar to gastric juices, right?  I mean, maybe he fell in it or... may... maybe it's a product of a... of a particular vegetation that grows in the area.  ",6,21
SCULLY:    It was... it was on the Schiffs.  ,6,21
SCULLY:    What is the most logical explanation?  ,6,21
SCULLY:    (confused)   What arrangement?  ,6,21
SCULLY:    Sir?  You're satisfied with my conclusions in this case?  ,6,21
SCULLY:    Well... I was unable to determine a clear cause of death nor was I able to fully account for the condition of Agent Mulder's body.  ,6,21
"SCULLY:    (confused)   No.  I mean that was one possible scenario that I mentioned, but... in my mind it, it, it was the least plausible.  ",6,21
SCULLY:    My role in the X-Files has always been to provide a... a rational scientific perspective to cases that would seem to defy explanation-- a counterpoint to Agent Mulder.  ,6,21
SCULLY:    Have I?  How many X-Files has my scientific approach fully and satisfactorily explained?  ,6,21
"SCULLY:    Sir, this one makes no sense at all.  ",6,21
SCULLY:    That's what Agent Mulder would have thought.  ,6,21
"SCULLY:    I, uh... I still can't believe it.  ",6,21
"SCULLY:    No, thank you.  ",6,21
SCULLY:    I was beginning to think that I was the only one who was a little suspicious.  ,6,21
SCULLY:    (confused)   Find who?  ,6,21
SCULLY:    I don't understand.  ,6,21
"SCULLY:    (getting angry)   Those were not my findings.  You guys believe that, too-- that Mulder was murdered?  ",6,21
"SCULLY:    No, it is not the obvious answer!  ",6,21
"SCULLY:    (furious)   What the hell is wrong with everybody?!  You guys, there are unanswered questions here!  Am I the only one that's asking them?!  ",6,21
"SCULLY:    You three, of all people!  You should be all over this, not buying the party line.  Look, something else is going on here.  Am I the only one who thinks that?!  ",6,21
SCULLY:    (accusing)   What have you done with him?  ,6,21
SCULLY:    Where is Mulder?  Where is he?  What have you done with him?!  ,6,21
"SCULLY:    (hysterical, pushing SKINNER's hands away)   Look, something else is going on here!  Where is he?!  Where's Mulder?!  ",6,21
"SCULLY:    Mulder, the Schiffs are dead.  ",6,21
"SCULLY:    Mulder, their remains were discovered in a field.  That's... that's what brought us to this case in the first place.  I found your remains in that same field.  ",6,21
SCULLY:    How did you get here?  ,6,21
"SCULLY:    From North Carolina direct to your apartment door?  (MULDER thinks about it.)  Mulder, you don't remember getting here, do you?  Neither do I.  ",6,21
"SCULLY:    Mulder, why did you knock?  This is your apartment.  (MULDER thinks about it.)  And you don't seem the least bit surprised to find me here.  And what about the Schiffs?  I mean, if they're alive, as you say, then... then where are they?  Where'd they go?  Mulder, five minutes ago... this room was filled with people attending your wake.  ",6,21
"SCULLY:    Mulder, this is not reality.  This is a hallucination.  It has to be.  And either I am having it, or you are having it or we are having it together.  ",6,21
"SCULLY:    Something that we found in that field, Mulder, because that's where it began.  (realizing)  Wild mushroom.  Wild mushrooms, Mulder.  They were growing there.  I stepped on one, and it gave off spores.  Several varieties of  of mushrooms are known for their hallucinogenic properties. If  if we inhaled it...  ",6,21
"SCULLY:    This is it, Mulder.  What if we're still there?  If we're still in that cave in North Carolina-- that we're not here in this apartment right now?  ",6,21
"SCULLY:    No, Mulder, bear with me.  I think this is making sense.  I think that Angela and Wallace Schiff were digested by that substance that I found all over that field.  That they were dissolved and then expelled up out of the ground.  What if that substance and this hallucinogen are - are from one and the same organism?  ",6,21
"SCULLY:    A giant fungal organism, Mulder.  We already know that they exist. Biologists have found specimens that range dozens of acres that weigh hundreds of tons.  And what if this one needs to feed on living tissue, Mulder?  There is carnivorous plant life.  There's  there's the Venus Flytrap and the pitcher plant.  Mulder, what if this one puts off an hallucinogen...  ",6,21
SCULLY:    To make it complacent.  To keep it still while it devours it.  ,6,21
"SCULLY:    What if we're still underground, Mulder?  What if we're moving deeper into the cave?  Or being moved?  Mulder, what if we're being digested?  Right now.  ",6,21
"SCULLY:    That's correct, sir.  We know that the organism extends for at least ten acres. Though it's mostly subterranean so it may be far larger.  ",6,21
SCULLY:    The lab results determined that the spores we were exposed to have a chemical structure similar to LSD.  They also contain an alkaloid which induces a state of narcosis.  ,6,21
SCULLY:    That's right.  ,6,21
"SCULLY:    Well, the fact remains we did.  ",6,21
"SCULLY:    Mulder, we did escape.  I think you're suffering from post-traumatic stress.  ",6,21
"SCULLY:    Mulder, I...  ",6,21
SCULLY:    Mulder!  ,6,21
SCULLY:    (weakly)   Mushroom.  ,6,21
"SCULLY:    (voiceover)   From Space, it seems an abstraction-- a magician's trick on a darkened stage.  And from this distance one might never imagine that it is alive.  It first appeared in the sea almost four billion years ago in the form of single-celled life.  In an explosion of life spanning millions of years, nature's first multicellular organisms began to multiply... and then it stopped.  440 million years ago, a great mass extinction would kill off nearly every species on the planet leaving the vast oceans decimated and empty.  Slowly, plants began to evolve, then insects, only to be wiped out in the second great mass extinction upon the Earth.  The cycle repeated again and again.  Reptiles emerging, independent of the sea only to be killed off. Then dinosaurs, struggling to life along with the first birds, fish, and flowering plants - their decimations Earth's fourth and fifth great extinctions.  Only 100,000 years ago, Homo Sapiens appear-- man. From cave paintings to the bible to Columbus and Apollo 11, we have been a tireless force upon the earth and off cataloguing the natural world as it unfolds to us.  Rising to a world population of over five billion people all descended from that original single cell, that first spark of life. But for all our knowledge, what no one can say for certain, is what or who ignited that original spark.  Is there a plan, a purpose or a reason to our existence? Will we pass, as those before us, into oblivion, into the sixth extinction that scientists warn is already in progress?  ",6,22
"SCULLY:    (voiceover)   Or will the mystery be revealed through a sign, a symbol, a revelation?  ",6,22
"SCULLY:    (reading)  Dr. Solomon Merkmallen, Professor of Biology, University of Ivory Coast.  ",6,22
SCULLY:     elsewhere... in this universe.  ,6,22
"SCULLY:    Yeah. (glancing at MULDER)  It's the idea that Mars or other planets were habitable long before Earth and that, uh, cosmic collisions on these planets blasted microbes into our solar system - some of which landed and flourished here.  ",6,22
"SCULLY:    Well, almost any scientist would... theoretically. I mean, it's just a theory. That's about it, though.  You don't think this has anything to do with his death, do you?  ",6,22
SCULLY:    (pointedly to MULDER)   Much less plausible.  ,6,22
SCULLY:    And what was it supposed to say?  ,6,22
"SCULLY:    Well, why don't we?  ",6,22
"SCULLY:    What are we doing, Mulder?  This is a police matter at best.  ",6,22
SCULLY:    Are you going to try and convince me that you have no personal interest in this case?  ,6,22
"SCULLY:    Oh, come on.  ",6,22
SCULLY:    Two men suggesting that we're all Martians.  Now why would they possibly come into foul play?  ,6,22
"SCULLY:    (barely understood)  I don't understand you, Mulder.  You're willing to pursue any case involving aliens no matter how tenuous the connection.  There has to be some limit to your interest... I mean, this endless pursuit of the truth, Mulder it just... it doesn't make any sense to me now.  ",6,22
SCULLY:    Mulder?  Did you hear a word of what I just said?  ,6,22
"SCULLY:    No?  (sadly)  Well, maybe you didn't want to hear it.  ",6,22
"SCULLY:    Mulder... look, after all you've done, after all you've uncovered--  a conspiracy of men doing human experiments, men who are all now dead-- you exposed their secrets.  I mean, you've won.  What more could you possibly hope to do or to find?  ",6,22
SCULLY:    Guess I was right about this being a police matter.  Detective?  ,6,22
SCULLY:    Agents Mulder and Scully with the FBI.  What do you have here?  ,6,22
SCULLY:    Any word on this Dr. Sandoz?  ,6,22
SCULLY:    Told by whom?  ,6,22
SCULLY:    (joining them)  Capable of murder?  ,6,22
"SCULLY:    Are you, uh, speaking of this?  ",6,22
SCULLY:    (worried)   Mulder?  ,6,22
"SCULLY:    What is it, Mulder?  ",6,22
SCULLY:    Do you have a fever?  ,6,22
SCULLY:    You're not kidding.  (She looks at the rubbing.)  It's just a piece of paper.  ,6,22
SCULLY:    You're late.  ,6,22
"SCULLY:    I called Chuck as I knew you would for authentication, and to get his professional opinion on how you say it's affecting you.  ",6,22
SCULLY:    Is it happening right now?  ,6,22
SCULLY:    Because the rubbing is a fake and I'm not the first one to say so..  ,6,22
SCULLY:    And the fact that it was found in Africa makes it all the mores suspicious as a fabrication.  ,6,22
"SCULLY:    Well, that's what someone would have you believe this is.  ",6,22
SCULLY:    As it turns out neither of us had to go very far to find out.  ,6,22
"SCULLY:    Barnes documented Sandoz's fakery once before.  If he was blunt about his colleague when we met him, in here, he is downright brutal.  ",6,22
"SCULLY:    Well, it's quite scholarly, actually.  ",6,22
"SCULLY:    Mulder, if it were real then why would an American Indian artifact be fused in rock on the west coast of the African continent?  ",6,22
SCULLY:    It was from outer space.  ,6,22
SCULLY:    Mulder?  Hey.  ,6,22
SCULLY:    Let's step outside.   Step outside.  ,6,22
SCULLY:    You're in pain.  ,6,22
"SCULLY:    Mulder, whatever is causing this I think it needs immediate attention.  I'm going to schedule you an imagining scan.  ",6,22
"SCULLY:    Mulder, you're not okay.  If nothing else, you should be at home in bed.  ",6,22
SCULLY:    You had a sense of it?  ,6,22
"SCULLY:    Well, I hope you're not going to suggest that we arrest him on that rather baseless assumption.  ",6,22
SCULLY:    We'll come get you to    ,6,22
"SCULLY:    Well, I think I know who he was going to see.  ",6,22
SCULLY:    Your World War II code-talker  ,6,22
"SCULLY:    Or write them.  Mulder, you also said that we'd find a body.  Care to make good on that prediction?  ",6,22
SCULLY:    No. Why?  ,6,22
"SCULLY:    Oh, God.  ",6,22
"SCULLY:    Parts of his body were missing-- his arms, his hands, uh, parts of his vital organs and his thyroid.  ",6,22
SCULLY:    On Agent Mulder's urging I ran tissue samples through what's called a charged particle directional spectrometer.  There were traces of a kind of radiation called C.G.R.  ,6,22
SCULLY:    I don't know how to explain it but I feel that we can make an arrest.  ,6,22
"SCULLY:    Mulder, let's go.  ",6,22
"SCULLY:    Mulder, you're losing it.  ",6,22
"SCULLY:    Mulder, you need to see a doctor.  ",6,22
SCULLY:    I'll find the artifacts.  You need to go home right now. Mulder...  ,6,22
"SCULLY:    Yes, I was looking to speak to Mr. Hosteen.  ",6,22
"SCULLY:    Yes, I understand.  I saw him wheeled out of here in an emergency..  Can you tell me what's wrong with him?  ",6,22
"SCULLY:    (showing her badge)  I, um, I know him.  He's helped me in the past.  I'm sure that he wouldn't mind you telling me.  ",6,22
SCULLY:    Hey!  ,6,22
SCULLY:    Okay... I need answers from you.  ,6,22
SCULLY:    But then other pieces surfaced.  ,6,22
"SCULLY:    (looking at the translation)   A passage from the Bible on an artifact that you're saying is extraterrestrial.  And, uh, how did the aliens get it?  ",6,22
"SCULLY:    And, uh, this was going to tell us what?  ",6,22
SCULLY:   (on phone)   Hello?  I'm sorry.  I'm trying to reach Fox Mulder.  ,6,22
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   Mulder, where are you?  ",6,22
SCULLY:   (on phone)   Where?  Who answered the phone?  ,6,22
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   I'm in New Mexico, with, uh, with Dr. Sandoz.  ",6,22
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   (sighs)   Mulder, this, uh, artifact if I'm to believe what I'm being told about it...  ",6,22
SCULLY:   (on phone)   It has a passage on it from Genesis.  ,6,22
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   Mulder, it can't be.  ",6,22
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   No, it would mean nothing, Mulder.  ",6,22
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   Mulder, that is science fiction.  It doesn't hold a drop of water.  ",6,22
"SCULLY:   (on phone, frustrated)   Mulder, I will not accept that.  It is just not possible.  ",6,22
"SCULLY:    (voiceover)   It began with an act of supreme violence--  a big bang expanding ever  outward, cosmos born of matter and gas, matter and gas ten billion years ago.  Whose idea was this?  Who had the audacity for such invention?  And the reason?  Were we part of that plan ten billion years ago?  Are we born only to die?  To be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth before giving way to our generations?  If there is a beginning, must there be an end?  We burn like fires in our time only to be extinguished.  To surrender to the elements' eternal reclaim.  Matter and gas... will this all end one day?  Life no longer passing to life, the Earth left barren like the stars above, like the cosmos.  Will the hand that lit the flame let it burn down?  Let it burn out?  Could we, too, become extinct?  Or if this fire of life living inside us is meant to go on, who decides?  Who tends the flames? Can he reignite the spark even as it grows cold and weak?  ",6,22
"SCULLY:    No, I, uh, I don't think that's right.  I don't share in their faith.  ",6,22
SCULLY:    I know.  I think they have.  ,6,22
SCULLY:    I'm sorry.  ,6,22
SCULLY:   (on phone)   Scully.  ,6,22
SCULLY:   (on phone)    I'm with Dr. Sandoz.  ,6,22
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   In Gallup, New Mexico.  Where are you?  ",6,22
SCULLY:   (on phone)   What happened to him?  ,6,22
SCULLY:    I have to go.  I have to leave.  ,6,22
SCULLY:    (worried)   They just told me he's in the special psychiatric unit.  ,6,22
"SCULLY:    No, you said that there was bad news.  You didn't tell me what was wrong.  (SKINNER doesn't say anything)   Look, I'm sorry.  It took me three flights to get here.  ",6,22
SCULLY:    What?  What is it?  ,6,22
"SCULLY:    What's wrong with him?  This man right here, Fox Mulder?  ",6,22
SCULLY:    Waiting for what?  ,6,22
SCULLY:    I want to talk to him.  ,6,22
SCULLY:    (confidently)   Not to me.  ,6,22
SCULLY:    (defensively)   About what?  ,6,22
SCULLY:    When we took this case... when Skinner gave it to us.  ,6,22
SCULLY:    Investigation into a murder.  ,6,22
SCULLY:    I never sent you that report.  ,6,22
SCULLY:    Why were you with him last night?  ,6,22
SCULLY:    You're a liar.  ,6,22
SCULLY:    You're both liars.  ,6,22
SCULLY:   (on phone)   Hello.  ,6,22
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   Dr. Sandoz, I-I don't know if this is a secure line.  ",6,22
SCULLY:   (on phone)   What they are?  ,6,22
SCULLY:    For what?  ,6,22
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,6,22
SCULLY:    (on phone)   Dr. Sandoz?  Hello?  ,6,22
SCULLY:   (on phone)   Dr. Sandoz?  ,6,22
"SCULLY:    FBI. Special Agents Scully and Mulder. We'd like a word with your manager, please.  ",7,1
"SCULLY:    Sir, would you do us a favor and gather your employees, please?  ",7,1
"SCULLY:    Well, this was also found in the car. (holds up a blood-splattered button) It's a badge that's only given to employees.  Is that correct?  ",7,1
SCULLY:    Thirty-two.  ,7,1
SCULLY:    I don't believe that we said the victim was male.  ,7,1
"SCULLY:    Somehow, I don't think Lucky Boy would make that list.  ",7,1
"SCULLY:    I guess.  So what are you saying, Mulder?  This place has been scrubbed from top to bottom to cover up evidence?  ",7,1
SCULLY:    You're saying Mr. Pankow had his brain very neatly removed from his skull right here in this kitchen?  ,7,1
"SCULLY:    But next to the shake machine, Mulder?  I think that we should be checking out employee lockers and not entertaining the idea that ad hoc surgery was performed here.  ",7,1
"SCULLY:    Yeah, but Mulder, we're in Orange County.  ",7,1
SCULLY:    (skeptically)   Through an inch-and-a-half opening that looks like it was cut with a hole saw?  ,7,1
SCULLY:    The proboscis of what?  ,7,1
"SCULLY:    Yes, it looks like it.  ",7,1
"SCULLY:    No, I'd say that's ground beef.  ",7,1
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,7,1
"SCULLY:    Sir, may we speak with you?  ",7,1
SCULLY:    Derwood Spinks has disappeared.  ,7,1
"SCULLY:    My partner saw Spinks in your neighborhood yesterday morning.  At that time, you told Agent Mulder that you hadn't seen Mr. Spinks.  Is that correct?  ",7,1
"SCULLY:    Thank you, Mr. Roberts.  We'll contact you if we have any further questions.  ",7,1
SCULLY:    About what?  ,7,1
SCULLY:    What didn't he want you to tell us?  ,7,1
SCULLY:    He was last seen parked outside your apartment. You didn't notice him?  ,7,1
"SCULLY:    Oh, my God.  ",7,1
"SCULLY:    Dr. Rinehart, step away from him.  ",7,1
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   Hey, Mulder, it's me.  What now?  ",7,2
"SCULLY:   (on phone)   Yes, I'm in Chicago.  I'm on the northeast corner of 7th and Hunter just like you asked.  Only you're not here.  So where are you?  ",7,2
SCULLY:   (on phone)   Yeah.  ,7,2
SCULLY:    Hey.  What's down there?  ,7,2
"SCULLY:    Organized crime.  The Bureau's been trying to build a racketeering case against him for the past few years.  Gambling, extortion, murder.  ",7,2
SCULLY:    Ouch.  ,7,2
"SCULLY:    Mulder, you keep saying ""this man.""  Who is this man?  ",7,2
SCULLY:    Was this basement thoroughly searched?  ,7,2
SCULLY:    And your theory is?  ,7,2
"SCULLY:    So, basically, what if we were looking for Wile E. Coyote? You're saying that he is invulnerable, right?  ",7,2
"SCULLY:    You know in 1998, there was a British soldier who plummeted 4,500 feet when his parachute failed and he walked away with a broken rib.  ",7,2
"SCULLY:    My point is that if there's a wind gust, or a sudden updraft and, plus, if he landed in exactly the right way, I mean, I don't know.  Maybe he just got lucky.  ",7,2
SCULLY:    I don't know.  ,7,2
SCULLY:    Mulder?  ,7,2
"SCULLY:    Look at this.  If this cart were on the platform when he hit, that would explain the condition of these wheels.  And what if this whole thing had just enough give to save his life?  ",7,2
"SCULLY:    Yeah, we have to find him.  ",7,2
"SCULLY:    I think you're taking a flier here, Mulder.   There's got to be at least 600 people with prosthetic eyes in the greater Chicago area.  ",7,2
SCULLY:    Maybe he can't see his way to the door.  ,7,2
"SCULLY:    Ma'am, we're not plumbers.  ",7,2
"SCULLY:    You okay, Mulder?  ",7,2
"SCULLY:    Mr. Weems, why were you hiding in a vacant apartment?  ",7,2
SCULLY:    Avoiding whom?  ,7,2
"SCULLY:    Last night, Cutrona had you thrown off the roof of 1107 Hunter Avenue--  is that correct?  ",7,2
SCULLY:    You got lucky?  ,7,2
SCULLY:    So that's what you were doing there last night--  playing poker?  ,7,2
"SCULLY:    Mr. Weems, can I ask you to reconsider testifying against Cutrona?  ",7,2
"SCULLY:    Well, it would be in your best interest.  He's tried to kill you once and he will undoubtedly do it again.  ",7,2
"SCULLY:  So, here's the plan, as I see it: we inform the Chicago field office about Weems, leaving it to them to secure his testimony, you change your clothes ...  ",7,2
SCULLY:    ... we fly back to D.C. by sunset and all is right with the world.  ,7,2
"SCULLY:    ""Interesting,"" Mulder was when we were looking for Wile E. Coyote. (she pushes the button again)   Come on, Mulder, this guy just got lucky. There's no X-File here.  ",7,2
SCULLY:    Stairs.  ,7,2
"SCULLY:    So, uh, we've searched the entire building and there's no sign of Henry Weems.  I'm guessing that he's on the run.  ",7,2
SCULLY:    You think that Weems could have killed him in self-defense?  ,7,2
"SCULLY:    What the hell happened here, Mulder?  ",7,2
SCULLY:    Meaning...?  ,7,2
SCULLY:    Dumb luck?  ,7,2
SCULLY:    Hang on a second.  ,7,2
"SCULLY:    (she goes to RICHIE)  Hey. Your name's Richie, right?  ",7,2
SCULLY:    I'm Dana.  ,7,2
"SCULLY:    (gently turning RICHIE away from the scene)   Why don't we, uh, head back to your room?  I'm sure that's what your mom would want.  ",7,2
SCULLY:    So I'm guessing you're a sports fan.  Which one's your favorite?  ,7,2
"SCULLY:    I like baseball, too.   (SCULLY notices another intricate Rube Goldbergesque contraption in the room.)  Did Henry make this for you?  ",7,2
SCULLY:    That's pretty neat.  ,7,2
SCULLY:    You went to the hospital because of your liver?  ,7,2
SCULLY:    Yeah.  They just want to talk to him.  Do you have any idea where he might have gone?  ,7,2
SCULLY:    He knows nothing.  ,7,2
"SCULLY:   Mulder, as to your theory...  ",7,2
"SCULLY:    Why would the world's most supernaturally lucky man work as a building superintendent?  I mean, why doesn't he just run down to the Illinois state lottery, enter, and, you know, he'd win automatically?  ",7,2
SCULLY:   (on phone)   That's it? ... Got nothing else.  Okay. Thank you.  ,7,2
"SCULLY:    He has no record of any kind, Mulder.  He doesn't earn enough in a year to file tax returns.  He has no savings account, no checking account, no insurance.  Doesn't even have a video rental card for that matter.  He doesn't even have a driver's license.  I mean, it's like he's intentionally stayed off the radar.  He's retired from the world.  ",7,2
SCULLY:    Henry.  ,7,2
SCULLY:    13?  ,7,2
"SCULLY:    More good luck, you're saying?  ",7,2
"SCULLY:    Mulder, there are millions of reasons for that including survivor's guilt.  I mean, what doesn't track for me is why Henry Weems would drop off the map just because he suddenly became incredibly lucky.  ",7,2
"SCULLY:    So, let me get this straight.  This is the man who initially won the money?  ",7,2
SCULLY:    And once you and he ascertained that the accident victim was still alive this man fled on foot?  ,7,2
"SCULLY:    Afterwards, the man who was hit by the truck handed you the lottery card, and said...  ",7,2
"SCULLY:    (skeptical)  Mm-hmm.  Thank you, Mr. Albert.  I think that will be all.  ",7,2
SCULLY:    For such a fortunate man a lot of unfortunate things happen in Henry Weems' wake.  ,7,2
"SCULLY:    So, Mulder, Henry Weems came here to buy a lottery ticket.  Why?  ",7,2
"SCULLY:    Well, he's not in his place and he's not with Richie. You think he hid in there?  ",7,2
"SCULLY:    Pretty damn well, I'd say.  That thing must go all over the building, Mulder.  I'll start with the roof if you want to start with the basement.  ",7,2
SCULLY:    I haven't a clue.  ,7,2
"SCULLY:    Mulder, what does that prove?  ",7,2
"SCULLY:    For Richie, right?  ",7,2
SCULLY:    CMV negative.  Cytomegalovirus.  ,7,2
"SCULLY:    However, you will need protection from Cutrona and his men.  ",7,2
"SCULLY:    I'm sorry, Mulder.  That was utterly irresponsible. You're feeding the delusions of a man who has had three attempts made upon his life. You're supposed to be talking him into protective custody, not out of it.  ",7,2
"SCULLY:    (voice)    Mulder, you're putting an astounding amount of faith in coincidence and luck.  Essentially, you're betting a man's life on it.  And even if you believe in so-called lucky streaks you have to know they all eventually end.  ",7,2
"SCULLY:    Luckiest man in the world?  Hell, Mulder, I just beat him.  ",7,2
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,7,2
"SCULLY:    Well, he's got a bruised rib and a black eye.  It certainly could have been worse.  And don't tell me he just got lucky.  ",7,2
SCULLY:    I don't mean to make light of his misfortune but it may have knocked some sense into his head.   He's agreed to testify against Cutrona.  ,7,2
SCULLY:    No.  ,7,2
"SCULLY:    We'll get one, though.  ",7,2
SCULLY:    Not good.  If we don't find a donor in the next few hours...  ,7,2
"SCULLY:    Mulder, you're speaking as if we're all trapped in one of those contraptions that he built.  ",7,2
SCULLY:    What are you doing?  ,7,2
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,7,2
SCULLY:    Maybe higher.  Maybe everything does happen for a reason... whether we see it or not.  ,7,2
"SCULLY: What is it, Mulder? ",7,3
SCULLY: You're a liar. ,7,3
SCULLY: The passage from the Bible on an artifact that you were saying is extraterrestrial? ,7,3
"SCULLY: (voiceover) I came in search of something I did not believe existed. I've stayed on now, in spite of myself. In spite of everything I've ever held to be true. I will continue here as long as I can... as long as you are beset by the haunting illness which I saw consume your beautiful mind. What is this discovery I've made? How can I reconcile what I see with what I know? I feel this was meant not for me to find but for you ... to make sense of -- make the connections which can't be ignored... connections which, for me, deny all logic and reason. What is this source of power I hold in my hand -- this rubbing -- a simple impression taken from the surface of the craft? I watched this rubbing take its undeniable hold on you, saw you succumb to its spiraling effect. ",7,3
SCULLY: (voiceover) Now I must work to uncover what your illness prevents you from finding. In the source of every illness lies its cure. ,7,3
SCULLY: Who's there? Who's there?! ,7,3
SCULLY: What do you want? ,7,3
SCULLY: I asked that no one be told about it... nor that I'm here. ,7,3
SCULLY: You knew Dr. Merkmallen? ,7,3
"SCULLY: Well... I was working late last night by lamplight and, uh, I saw a man who vanished... and then they just swarmed. ",7,3
SCULLY: Why? ,7,3
SCULLY: Caused by the ship out there? ,7,3
SCULLY: Let's get him in the truck! He's got to get to a hospital! Hospital! ,7,3
SCULLY: Okay! ,7,3
"SCULLY: (voiceover) I feel you slipping away from me with every minute I fail here. What are the elusive meanings I cannot see that are hidden here? If I could understand it, know how it affected you, learn how to use its power to save you. ",7,3
SCULLY: What is it? ,7,3
"SCULLY: Look, I'm sorry. I don't speak your language. ",7,3
SCULLY: Stay away from me! ,7,3
SCULLY: You're the murderer here. ,7,3
SCULLY: Dr. Merkmallen! ,7,3
SCULLY: You don't even believe in that. ,7,3
SCULLY: (breathes heavily) I'm here only to help my partner. ,7,3
SCULLY: (to DR. BARNES) What is it? ,7,3
"SCULLY: (voiceover) The work here is painstaking-- a slow and tedious piecing together. It appears to be a craft, its skin covered in the intricate symbols you and I both saw but which I now understand are part of a complex communication. Dr. Barnes has broken some of the symbols into letters using an ancient Navajo alphabet and, though it has helped to uncover some of what's here it has also made for greater confusion. On the top surface of the craft I'm finding words describing human genetics. (On graph paper she translates the names of the four basic nucleotides - CYTOSINE, GUANINE, ADEMINE, THYMINE. [CarriK: I think that either Scully or the Aliens spelled one of those wrong. Adenine is how I learned it.{DrWeesh who has a Degree in Medical Science agrees with CarriK!}]) Efforts to read the bottom of the craft have been harder. Our workers were scared away by phenomena I admit I can't explain-- a sea of blood, a swarm of insects. But what little we have found has been staggering-- passages from the Christian Bible, from pagan religions, from Ancient Sumeria... science and mysticism conjoined. But more than words, they are somehow imbued with power. I've ignored warnings to quit this work, remaining committed to finding answers, afraid only that our secret here won't last and that I might be too late. ",7,3
SCULLY: What? ,7,3
"SCULLY: I found more, too. ",7,3
"SCULLY: 24 panels... One for each human chromosome. [CarriK: Yes, 24 chromosomes is correct. 22 pairs plus the two sex chromosomes. They get special treatment. Go to http://www.ornl.gov/hgmis/resource/info.html for more info on the subject. Thanks Sis 80K and CathyS.] A map of their makeup-- maybe a map of our entire genetic makeup... (she sighs in amazement) A complete human genome. I mean, it's like... it's the most beautiful... intricate work of art. ",7,3
"SCULLY: You're sick, Dr. Barnes. You need to get off your feet, lie down. ",7,3
SCULLY: I'm only here to help my friend. ,7,3
SCULLY: It has power. ,7,3
SCULLY: We have to get to the police. ,7,3
SCULLY: Stop! ,7,3
SCULLY: That was him. That was the man I saw in the tent... in the road. ,7,3
"SCULLY: Oh, God. What are you doing? ",7,3
SCULLY: What happened to you? ,7,3
SCULLY: You slammed on the brakes. There was a man. ,7,3
SCULLY: No. He was right there-- sitting right where you are in your seat. ,7,3
SCULLY: Turn us around. ,7,3
SCULLY: No ... I'm going home.  ,7,3
SCULLY: Where is he? Is he still in the hospital? ,7,3
SCULLY: Is he still at Georgetown Memorial? ,7,3
SCULLY: Do you know where he is or don't you?! ,7,3
SCULLY: I have been on a plane for 22 hours. I have to see him. ,7,3
SCULLY: What kind of trouble? ,7,3
SCULLY: Kritschgau? ,7,3
SCULLY: Responsibility for what? ,7,3
SCULLY: He's not dying. ,7,3
SCULLY: (calm and deliberate) He's not dying. He is more alive than he has ever been. He's more alive than his body can withstand and what's causing it may be extraterrestrial in origin. ,7,3
SCULLY: Maybe as his partner... but not as his doctor. ,7,3
"SCULLY (voice): Please. I need to see him. I'm begging you, please. Thank you. ",7,3
"SCULLY: (gently) Mulder, it's me. I know that you can hear me. If you can just give me some sign. (No response.) I want you to know where I've been... what I found. I think that, if you know, that you could find a way to hold on. (whisper) I need you to hold on. I found a key... the key... to every question that has ever been asked. It's a puzzle... (her voice begins to break) ... but the pieces are there for us to put together and I know that they can save you if you can just hold on. (She is almost crying as she pleads with him, gripping his hand tightly, staring into his blank face.) Mulder... please. Hold on.  ",7,3
SCULLY: It appears to be a craft; its skin covered with the intricate symbols you and I both saw. They are somehow imbued with power. ,7,4
SCULLY: He's not dying. He is more alive than he's ever been and what's causing it may be extraterrestrial. ,7,4
"SCULLY: Please, Mulder. Hold on.  ",7,4
SCULLY: How did you get in here? ,7,4
SCULLY: What's that supposed to mean? ,7,4
SCULLY: Like you? Almost killing him by shooting him full of Phenytoin for a few moments of lucidity. ,7,4
SCULLY: I don't believe that. ,7,4
"SCULLY: Well, whatever it is, it's killing him. And we have to get it out of him. ",7,4
SCULLY: (on phone) Scully. ,7,4
SCULLY: (on phone) Why? What happened? ,7,4
SCULLY: There were guards posted here. A man who's gravely ill doesn't just get up and disappear. ,7,4
SCULLY: How did this happen? ,7,4
SCULLY: His mother? ,7,4
SCULLY: Has anybody spoken with her? ,7,4
"SCULLY: Sir, this isn't just a case. This is Agent Mulder we're speaking about. ",7,4
SCULLY: Sir! ,7,4
SCULLY: Don't move. Who's there? ,7,4
SCULLY: (lowering the gun) What are you doing here? How did you get here? ,7,4
SCULLY: Surprise? That you're standing here. The last time I saw you was in New Mexico. They'd taken you from the hospital. Your... your doctors feared the worst. ,7,4
SCULLY: He's missing. ,7,4
SCULLY: He's very ill. ,7,4
SCULLY: Yeah. I know who that is.  ,7,4
SCULLY: (on phone) This is Dana Scully. ,7,4
"SCULLY: (whisper as the COURIER leaves) Thank you. (back into the phone) As before, you can reach me at your son's office at the FBI. Thank you. ",7,4
"SCULLY: (on phone, quietly) Sir, did you send me this book? ",7,4
SCULLY: (on phone) This book. It explains everything that I found in Africa... using the same symbols that I found on the ship. ,7,4
"SCULLY: (on phone) It's all here, sir-- a foretelling of mass extinction; a myth about a man who can save us from it. That's why they took Mulder. They think that his illness is a gift-- protection against the coming plague. ",7,4
SCULLY: Sir... Are you hurt? Are you cut? (to SKINNER's ASSISTANT) Get on the phone. ,7,4
SCULLY: Hey! Stop that man! ,7,4
"SCULLY: You told someone, didn't you? You let the information out. ",7,4
SCULLY: A man attacked Skinner in his office. ,7,4
SCULLY: For what he knows about Mulder. ,7,4
SCULLY: (amazed) What is this? These are mine. You've hacked into my files. What are you doing with these? ,7,4
SCULLY: By whom? ,7,4
SCULLY: What? ,7,4
SCULLY: This was not supposed to go public. ,7,4
SCULLY: (depressed) It doesn't matter. ,7,4
"SCULLY: Bum a cigarette, Agent Fowley? ",7,4
SCULLY: Really? I could swear I smell cigarette smoke on you. ,7,4
SCULLY: Yes. Let's. ,7,4
SCULLY: Where's Mulder? ,7,4
"SCULLY: I just want you to think. Think of Mulder when you met him. Think of the promise and the life in front of him. Think of him now. And then try and stand there in front of me, look me in the eye and tell me Mulder wouldn't bust his ass trying to save you. ",7,4
SCULLY: Why do you come to me like this? Why? When I can't find him. ,7,4
SCULLY: I don't think you're hearing me. ,7,4
SCULLY: Even if I did I wouldn't know how to save him. This science makes no sense to me. ,7,4
SCULLY: Are you asking me to pray? ,7,4
SCULLY: And you believed them. Traitor. ,7,4
SCULLY: Deserter. Coward. ,7,4
"SCULLY: You're not supposed to die, Mulder-- not here. ",7,4
SCULLY: Not in a comfortable bed with the devil outside. ,7,4
"SCULLY: No, Mulder, he's lulled you to sleep. He's made you trade your true mission for creature comforts. ",7,4
"SCULLY: No aliens. Have you looked outside, Mulder? ",7,4
"SCULLY: No, Mulder, you must get up. You must get up and fight... especially you. This isn't your place. Get up, Mulder. Get up and fight the fight. ",7,4
"SCULLY: Mulder. Mulder, you've got to wake up. I've got to get you out of here. Mulder, can you understand me? ",7,4
"SCULLY: (beginning to cry) Mulder, you've got to get up. I don't know how much time we have. You've got to get up, Mulder. ",7,4
"SCULLY: (whispering, pleading) No one can do it but you, Mulder. Mulder, help me. Please, Mulder. ",7,4
"SCULLY: Mulder, no work. You have to go back to bed. ",7,4
"SCULLY: (insistent) He was there-- we... we prayed together. Mulder, I don't believe that. I... I don't believe it. It's impossible. ",7,4
"SCULLY: (about to cry) I don't know what to believe anymore. Mulder, I was so determined to find a cure to save you that I could deny what it was that I saw and now I don't even know... I don't know... I don't know what the truth is ... I don't know who to listen to. I don't know who to trust. ",7,4
SCULLY: Diana Fowley was found murdered this morning. I never trusted her... but she helped save your life just as much as I did. She gave me that book. It was her key that led me to you. I'm sorry... I'm so sorry. I know she was your friend. ,7,4
SCULLY: And you are mine. ,7,4
"SCULLY:       Yes, sir.  ",7,5
SCULLY:       I'm sorry?  ,7,5
"SCULLY:    Mulder, have you been spreading rumours?  ",7,5
SCULLY:    Not particularly.  So what do you have here?  ,7,5
"SCULLY:    Thank you.  Merry Christmas to you, too.  ",7,5
SCULLY:       It looks like someone on the inside was trying to get out.  ,7,5
SCULLY:       What about the person or persons who did the digging?  ,7,5
"SCULLY:   (slight smile)    See, you had me up until there.  ",7,5
SCULLY:    I think it's what you said before.   I think it's a grave robbery with a twist.  You've got the fingerprints and the torn casket liner.  Most likely it's rigged evidence that's been faked by whoever exhumed the body.  ,7,5
"SCULLY:       Publicity ... fear ... rumours ...  I mean, I don't know what specific effect, but nonetheless it's ... (notices MULDER looking down at the ground)  What?  ",7,5
"SCULLY:    Special Agent Raymond Crouch, Age 56,  married, no children. After a sterling 21-year career with the Bureau, he retired in 1993.  And, then earlier this month, he was found in the garage of his Tallahassee home, service weapon in hand.  ",7,5
SCULLY:     I read over the report and there's no indication otherwise.  ,7,5
"SCULLY:    Obviously, there are clear ritualistic elements to this crime. But the question is why were they directed at Raymond Crouch?  ",7,5
"SCULLY:       Yes, somewhat.  They were former FBI agents who offered consulting services to law enforcement.  Somehow, they fell into disrepute.  ",7,5
SCULLY:       How well do you know this man?  ,7,5
SCULLY:       What's he doing here?  ,7,5
SCULLY:    Single-minded.  ,7,5
SCULLY:    Sounds like someone I know.  ,7,5
SCULLY:    All four committed suicide in the last six months.  All were exhumed from their graves in a ritual desecration.  They were members of the Millennium Group.  Is that correct?  ,7,5
"SCULLY:       Sir, we've been having a really difficult time gleaning any information whatsoever about the group ... about its membership, its practices ... I believe you can help us.  ",7,5
SCULLY:    Hey.  (MULDER doesn't look up)  I've got the men concentrating on the woods.  ,7,5
"SCULLY:       Well, if you're going to tell me that he, uh, stopped by the side of the road to raise the dead, which I hope you're not, I've got two things to say to you.  One is that his previous circles were made of blood, not salt, and two...  ",7,5
SCULLY:       Protecting himself against what?  ,7,5
SCULLY:    More salt.  ,7,5
SCULLY:   Losing your daughter.  You're in a custody battle with the parents of your late wife.  I just spoke with your doctor.  That's why you're here.  ,7,5
SCULLY:    And so you retired.  ,7,5
"SCULLY:    And to that end, they committed suicide.  ",7,5
SCULLY:    Could you tell us a little bit more about this man?  ,7,5
SCULLY:    Rice County morgue.  ,7,5
"SCULLY:    Mulder, you're telling me it's more important to track down four dead bodies than one live murderer.  ",7,5
"SCULLY:    Mulder, those people, even when they were alive mangled biblical prophecy to the extent that it's unrecognizable.  The year 2000 is just their artificial deadline and besides, 2001 is actually the start of the new millennium.  ",7,5
"SCULLY:    Anyway, I think that Frank's profile is sound.  ",7,5
"SCULLY:    And I think with it we have our best chance of finding this necromancer, as you call him.  So I am going down to the county morgue.  ",7,5
SCULLY:    And what are you going to do?  ,7,5
"SCULLY'S VOICE:   This is Agent Dana Scully with the FBI.  Please do not autopsy the murder victim that was brought in earlier -- the sheriff's deputy. If you've already started, stop now.  I'll be there shortly and I'll explain when I arrive.  ",7,5
SCULLY:    Hello?  ,7,5
SCULLY:    Sir?  ,7,5
SCULLY:    All things considered...?  ,7,5
"SCULLY:    The Sheriff's Deputy.   The man we found this morning. He was dead and then, somehow, he wasn't.  He attacked me.  ",7,5
SCULLY:    Three rounds center-of-mass into his chest.  No effect.  ,7,5
"SCULLY:    Yeah, this man, uh, Mulder calls a ""necromancer,"" our suspect, he was here, too.  He fired that shot with my gun.  He saved me.  I have no idea why.  He got away but I was in no shape to follow.  Look, sir, I can't even begin to offer an explanation for what happened but I have to say it is exactly what Mulder feared.  ",7,5
"SCULLY:    No, he went looking for our suspect's home.  No one's been able to contact him since.  I've got task force agents canvassing the northwestern Maryland area but it's a large territory to cover and we're running out of time. Sir, I'm just afraid that Mulder may have found what he's looking for. I need your help in finding him.  ",7,5
"SCULLY:    I'm not sure that I really understand your reasons, sir, and I'm starting to wonder what this is all about and how much you know about it. Mulder mentioned the four Millennium members who ""liveth and were dead."" Now, this morning in the morgue, I saw what he was talking about.  ",7,5
SCULLY:    One of them attacked me.  ,7,5
"SCULLY:    Now, as crazy as this sounds, I have to ask.  Do you believe that the Millennium Group is actually capable of bringing about the Endtime? Armageddon?  ",7,5
SCULLY:    But what if it were true?  Good and evil -- which would prevail?  ,7,5
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Scully.  ,7,5
SCULLY:   (on phone)    And?  ,7,5
SCULLY:    Rice County?  That's where I am right now.  ,7,5
SCULLY:    I'm going to need an address.  ,7,5
SCULLY:    Mr. Black.  ,7,5
SCULLY:    Mike Johnson's been taken for psychiatric evaluation. He'll be put under suicide watch just as you asked.  ,7,5
"SCULLY:    (smiles)   And, um...  ",7,5
SCULLY:       There's someone here to see you.  ,7,5
SCULLY:    You're not going to stay and watch?  ,7,5
"SCULLY:       No, it didn't.  ",7,5
"SCULLY:       Happy New Year, Mulder.  ",7,5
SCULLY:    Slow going.  Let's just say I had ample time to read the police report that you faxed me.  ,7,6
"SCULLY:    Sheriff's deputy is slain during a routine patrol.  It's a tragic occurrence but I don't see the mystery here, Mulder.  ",7,6
"SCULLY:    Yes, but that's according to the young man who's accused of his murder.  ",7,6
"SCULLY:    Mulder, tell me you've got more than SAT scores to show that this Tony Reed didn't commit this crime.  ",7,6
"SCULLY:    Oh, my God, it looks like he was hit with a sledgehammer.  ",7,6
"SCULLY:    The damage to the maxillofacial bones and the cranium is consistent with a blunt-force trauma, but... I'd say that, uh, Tony eats his Wheaties.  ",7,6
SCULLY:    Ugh.  His eyeglasses.  ,7,6
"SCULLY:    Well, maybe if he was under the influence of PCP or some kind of stimulant.  ",7,6
"SCULLY:    Well, even so, I mean, stress and fear may have triggered an adrenaline response which is known to enable feats of near-superhuman strength.  ",7,6
"SCULLY:    Sheriff, we don't mean to second-guess you. We're just hoping to be of some assistance.  ",7,6
"SCULLY:    Well, that might make things worse and they seem pretty bad already.  In your statement you say that Deputy Foster stopped you but you don't say why.  ",7,6
"SCULLY:    If you didn't do it, it's all the more reason to clear it up.  ",7,6
"SCULLY:    Tony, you're not likely to get a fairer hearing than this.  ",7,6
SCULLY:    16 years old and his life is over unless he starts telling the truth.  ,7,6
"SCULLY:    I'm not saying he's guilty, Mulder.  I'm inclined to agree that Tony Reed did not commit murder but I think that he saw the person who did, and he may be covering up for him.  ",7,6
SCULLY:    What kind of force?  ,7,6
"SCULLY:    (innocently, almost coy)  Mulder.  Rather than spirits... can we at least start with Tony's friends?  (looks like she is playing with his tie) Please?  Just... for me?  I think there's one person in particular I'd like to talk to.  ",7,6
SCULLY:    (showing her badge)   Chastity Raines?  I'm Agent Scully. This is Agent Mulder.  We're with the FBI.  ,7,6
SCULLY:    Do you?  ,7,6
SCULLY:    Do you realize that Tony could go to prison for the rest of his life for this?  ,7,6
"SCULLY:    A ""Betty""?  ",7,6
SCULLY:   (on phone)   Scully.  (pause)  What about the murder weapon?  ,7,6
SCULLY:    How many people have access to this room?  ,7,6
SCULLY:    (glancing up at a video camera)  What does the tape show?  ,7,6
SCULLY:    Can we take a look at the surveillance tape?  ,7,6
"SCULLY:    No one's saying that you are, Sheriff.  ",7,6
SCULLY:    Could there be a malfunction with the VCR?  ,7,6
SCULLY:    What am I supposed to be seeing?  ,7,6
SCULLY:    Sorry to make you trek over here for what's probably a glitch.  ,7,6
SCULLY:    Especially since ghosts don't go around leaving synthetic polymers in their wake.  ,7,6
SCULLY:    I think we can rule that out.  ,7,6
SCULLY:    Which is impossible because it only appears for a single frame.  ,7,6
SCULLY:    Scag?  ,7,6
SCULLY:    What?  ,7,6
"SCULLY:    Excuse me, please.  Thank you.  ",7,6
"SCULLY:    (looking at the squished MR BABBITT)    Based on the eyewitness accounts of the students I spoke to, at this moment I'd have to say that I don't have one.  ",7,6
SCULLY:    The ones we found in the evidence room?  ,7,6
SCULLY:    You think Max did this?  Based on what?  ,7,6
"SCULLY:    Well, he may have had motive but he didn't have opportunity. There was nobody here who saw him even go near the victim.  ",7,6
"SCULLY:    Well, Mulder, he's a teenager.  Everything about him is changing. His body and his brain chemistry is in a state of unparalleled upheaval, plus there's peer pressure and substance abuse.  Any one of these factors could alter his behavior radically.  ",7,6
SCULLY:    That's your theory?  ,7,6
"SCULLY:    Sheriff, we'd like to ask your son a few questions if that's okay.  ",7,6
"SCULLY:    (reading MAX's file)   High temperature and heart rate, low blood sugar, electrolytes show acidosis.  All of these symptoms are consistent with extreme exertion and withdrawal.  ",7,6
SCULLY:    That's not going to happen any time soon.  Your condition's getting worse and we're not going to be able to help you unless you can tell us what's going on.  ,7,6
SCULLY:    There's some test results missing from Max's chart. I think we should track them down.  ,7,6
SCULLY:    Hot off the presses.  ,7,6
SCULLY:    This can't be right.  ,7,6
"SCULLY:    Oh, my God.  ",7,6
"SCULLY:    Evidence of cerebral lesions from repeated concussions... arthritis in his spine and major joints. Stress fractures, numerous muscle and... and ligament micro-tears.  ",7,6
"SCULLY:    In a teenager?  I can't even imagine.  This is the kind of thing that you'd see in someone who's crashed race cars or played pro football for 15 years.  Whatever Max is doing, it's killing him.  ",7,6
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,7,6
SCULLY:    Mulder...  ,7,6
"SCULLY:    Yes, Mulder, but it's impossible.  The human body just isn't designed to move like that.  ",7,6
"SCULLY:    Well, it's too soon to tell.  He's unconscious and bleeding internally apparently from a blow to the abdomen.  ",7,6
SCULLY:    Why would he leave it behind?  You think he's doing it to taunt the police?  ,7,6
SCULLY:    But if he can do what you claimed then... then who could possibly intervene?  ,7,6
SCULLY:    Tony.  How do we find him?  ,7,6
"SCULLY:    The woods near where the deputy was killed. You know, Tony never came clean about what he was doing out there.  ",7,6
SCULLY:    Did the USGS show up?  ,7,6
SCULLY:    And what did they come up with?  ,7,6
"SCULLY:    What'd you expect them to find, Mulder?  ",7,6
"SCULLY:    Well, you and I were both in there and nothing happened to us. We're still slowpoking around.  ",7,6
"SCULLY:    Well, that's doubtful.  But no more so than any other theory. I mean, it's worth checking out.  ",7,6
"SCULLY:    Bruises and muscle strains, mostly.  He'll recover... go back to being a normal kid.  ",7,6
SCULLY:    (turning back to the men)  I promise you there is nothing supernatural about this man.  Donnie Pfaster is just plain evil.  ,7,7
SCULLY:    A man escaped from prison.  ,7,7
SCULLY:    Isn't that why we're here?  ,7,7
"SCULLY:    Mulder, this case doesn't bother me.  ",7,7
"SCULLY:    Mulder, that man does things to people that no one should ever have to think about.  It's not a question of if I should stay.  I don't have a choice. So let's get to work.  ",7,7
SCULLY:    6:06?  And what's so supernatural about that?  ,7,7
SCULLY:    Have they been apprehended?  ,7,7
"SCULLY:    You mean, did I see him raise his foot?  Yes, I saw that.  ",7,7
"SCULLY:    (smiling)  I know what hypnosis is, Mulder.  ",7,7
SCULLY:    If you're suggesting that Donnie Pfaster escaped from prison using a technique from a Vegas lounge act I'd think again.  ,7,7
"SCULLY:    So, how would Donnie have acquired this amazing ability?  ",7,7
"SCULLY:    Well, then, who?  ",7,7
SCULLY:    That song-- can you hear that?  ,7,7
SCULLY:    I haven't heard that song since high school.  That's the second time I've heard it in the last hour.  ,7,7
SCULLY:    Did you see him?  ,7,7
"SCULLY:    Excuse me, uh, could you turn that up, please?  ",7,7
SCULLY:    (looking very confused as she listens to the song)   Yeah.  ,7,7
"SCULLY:    You're lucky to be alive, Reverend Orison.  ",7,7
SCULLY:    Special Agent Dana Scully.  ,7,7
SCULLY:    (no nonsense)   That's nice... But my partner and I are more concerned with several disappearances from maximum-security facilities that seem to involve you.  ,7,7
SCULLY:    What do you mean?  Reverend?  ,7,7
"SCULLY:    This has nothing to do with me, sir.  ",7,7
"SCULLY:    It's not exactly a long shot, sir.  ",7,7
"SCULLY:    What happened to the inmates, sir?  ",7,7
"SCULLY:    Where are you going, Mulder?  ",7,7
SCULLY:    How do you prove that somebody isn't being directed by God? You don't believe that it happens?  ,7,7
SCULLY:    I don't believe that.  ,7,7
"SCULLY:    Donnie Pfaster isn't dead, and we don't know that the other inmates who escaped are dead, either.  ",7,7
"SCULLY:    No, but I believe that the Reverend believes what he's saying-- that's it's God working through him.  ",7,7
SCULLY:    (wounded)  I'm trying not to take offense.  ,7,7
"SCULLY:    Mulder, I have heard that song three times now.  That may not mean anything to you but it means something to me.  ",7,7
SCULLY:    I never thought about it before.  It never meant anything to me until yesterday when it made me remember something.  ,7,7
SCULLY:    (sighs again)   When I was thirteen my father was stationed in San Diego.  I was listening to the radio to that song when my mother came in and told me that my Sunday School teacher had been killed.  ,7,7
"SCULLY:    He had been murdered in his front yard...  And that's the first time that I ever felt that there was real evil in the world.  Mulder, Reverend Orison called me ""Scout.""  That's the same name that my Sunday School teacher called me.  Donnie pfaster escaped from prison at 6:06 a.m. That's exactly the same time that I woke up yesterday morning when my power went out.  ",7,7
SCULLY:    Swelling of the brain-- a trauma not uncommon with this kind of head injury or accident.  ,7,7
SCULLY:    And he did this himself?  ,7,7
"SCULLY:    ""Its powers.""  ",7,7
SCULLY:    So this hole in his head enables Reverend Orison to help these prisoners escape?  ,7,7
"SCULLY:    Well, nobody can stop the world, Mulder.  I don't care how many holes they have in their head.  ",7,7
"SCULLY:    But why?  I mean, even if he could, why?  ",7,7
"SCULLY:    Well, then, if Reverend Orison meant to kill Donnie Pfaster then why is he still alive?  ",7,7
"SCULLY:    Where did he go?  MULDER:    Marshal?  (No response. MULDER smacks him gently on the face to wake him up.)  MULDER:    Marshal?  MARSHAL:   (confused)   What?  SCULLY:    The prisoner... the man you were guarding in this room. What happened to him?  MULDER:    (looking at the MARSHAL's empty holster)  He's gone, Scully, so's the Marshal's gun.  SCULLY:    You didn't see him?  (The MARSHAL stands up and walks around the room in a daze trying to sort it out.)  MULDER:    Let's go, Scully.  (SCULLY finds a pad of paper on the bedside table.  She picks it up and reads it.)  MULDER:    What is it?  SCULLY:    What does this mean?  (SCULLY shows MULDER the pad of paper. Written on it are the words, ""DON'T LOOK ANY FURTHER."")  MULDER:    Did you tell him?  SCULLY:    No, I only told you.  MULDER:    Oh, he must have...  overheard us when we were talking in the hallway.  SCULLY:    I didn't mention the name of the song.  MULDER:    I'm sure you did.  SCULLY:    No, I'm sure I didn't, Mulder.  MULDER:    Well... maybe this was meant for you.  Don't look any further.  SCENE 14  (Bathroom.  DONNIE PFASTER gets up off the floor and positions himself over the sink to wipe away some of the wax from his face.  He looks up at the mirror, blood trickling down from his cut temple, as REVEREND ORISON cocks a gun behind him.)  REVEREND ORISON:    Whosoever shedeth man's blood by man shall his blood be shed.  DONNIE PFASTER:   What are you doing?  REVEREND ORISON:    Taking you home.   The wicked... will be punished.  SCENE 15  (Night.  REVEREND ORISON is digging a grave, DONNIE PFASTER is beside him on his knees with his hands tied behind his back.)  REVEREND ORISON:    Pray for God's love, Donnie.  Find the humility in yourself to allow God into your heart.  All you have to do is believe. Repent.  You'll feel God's love come to show you the way to His heavenly kingdom.  (DONNIE PFASTER whimpers and cries softly. ORISON points a gun at DONNIE's face.)  REVEREND ORISON:    Are you sorry for what you've done?  DONNIE PFASTER:   You...  (mumbling)  REVEREND ORISON:    What did you say?  DONNIE PFASTER:   Never... No...  No...  REVEREND ORISON:    Why are you crying?  DONNIE PFASTER:   I can't... I can't...  REVEREND ORISON:    Beg His forgiveness for what you did to those girls. For what you did to all those poor, helpless girls.  DONNIE PFASTER:   My violence is always waiting... for an instant. For when His back is turned.  You can see it now.  REVEREND ORISON:    Are you crying for your sins?  Or for yourself?  DONNIE PFASTER:   No, Reverend.  I cry for you.  Because you cannot kill me.  (DONNIE PFASTER's face shifts into that of a demon. ORISON backs away. Cut to ...)  SCENE 16  (Gravesite, next day.  Crime scene team is uncovering REVEREND ORISON's dead body.  MULDER and SCULLY observe.)  MULDER:    You know, it's funny, when all is said and done, there's... not much mystery in murder.  SCULLY:    And for that I owe you an apology, Mulder.  MULDER:    What do you mean?  SCULLY:    Well, you were right.  I was looking too hard for connections that weren't there.  Orison was a murderer, plain and simple.  He liberated those prisoners so he could bring them out here and pass judgment on them.  MULDER:    I guess in his own twisted way he was making good with his God.  Glory, Amen.  Let's go home, Scully.  SCULLY:    You know, Donnie Pfaster placed the call to the police that led us out here.  It's almost like he's begging us to hunt him down.  MULDER:    This X-File is over... lying dead there in a grave he dug himself. Let's let the US Marshals take over from here.  Don't look any further, Scully.  SCENE 17  (SCULLY's apartment.  That evening?   DONNIE PFASTER enters and looks around. He goes into her bedroom and takes her Bible from the chest at the foot of her bed and places it in a drawer.  SCULLY enters the apartment and TURNS ON LIGHTS??? Yes, she turns on lights in every room. Great view of the apartment.  She sets her keys on the table, her gun on the dresser, then begins taking off her suit and sleeveless navy top as DONNIE PFASTER watches from the closet.)  SCENE 18  (SCULLY's apartment.  She changes into a pair of gray flannel pajamas while DONNIE PFASTER watches from the closet.  VERY creepy. SCULLY is about to put her work clothes in the closet when she sees that her clock again says 6:66. She picks up the clock and the power goes off plunging the room into darkness, save for the streetlights which shine in the windows.  SCULLY looks at her closet door which is ajar, realizes something is wrong and starts to throw herself at the door to close it when it flies open and DONNIE PFASTER bursts out.)  CUT TO: (MULDER's apartment.  His phone rings.  The answering machine picks up.)  MULDER:   (recorded voice)   This is Fox Mulder.  Leave a message after the ... (beep).  MARSHALL DADDO:    (voice)   Agent Mulder, Marshall Joe Daddo in Marion. Just talked to a call girl who i.d.'d Donnie Pfaster as an attacker.  Claims Pfaster got real upset when she was wearing a red wig.  Upset she wasn't a redhead.  This mean anything to you?  Appreciate a call back.  (As the machine disconnects, MULDER enters his apartment. He does not check his messages.)  CUT TO: (SCULLY is thrown against a wall.  DONNIE PFASTER picks her up, grabbing her by the throat.  She fights back and manages to gouge his eyes with her thumbs, drawing blood.  He yells in pain and releases her as he reaches for his eyes. She punches him and runs across the room to grab her gun.  He runs at her and flings her repeatedly against the bureau mirror, breaking it.  The pieces shatter all over the floor and she drops the gun.  She kicks him, busts a lamp over his head, breaks free, dumps one of the bookcases on top of his head, and runs to the phone in the hall and dials 911.  DONNIE PFASTER chases her and flings her to the floor on her stomach and lands on top of her.)  SCULLY:    Go back to hell!  (DONNIE PFASTER has her hands behind her back.  He looks at her fingers.)  DONNIE PFASTER:   Who does your nails, girly girl?  SCULLY:    (trying to reason with him)   Let me go!  The only reason why you're alive is because I asked the judge for life!  The only reason why you're alive is because we didn't kill you when we could!  DONNIE PFASTER:   You're the one that got away.  You're all I think about.  SCULLY:    I'm a federal agent.  You do anything to me and they will not give you a break this time.  DONNIE PFASTER:   I'm going to run you a bath.  (SCULLY screams.  He clamps his hand over her mouth.)  CUT TO: (MULDER's apartment.  He is in his bathroom brushing his teeth.  He goes into his bedroom to set his radio alarm.  The last alarm was set at 7 PM. Hmm.  He sets it for 5 AM.  While setting it, he hears a fragment of the song ""Don't Look Any Further.""  He turns it back on while he finishes brushing and swallows the toothpaste. He looks thoughtfully at the radio.)  MUSIC:   Don't look any further Day-o, umba day-o Mambu ji ay-o...  CUT TO: (SCULLY's apartment.  DONNIE PFASTER has tied SCULLY arms behind her back with her own pantyhose.  Another pair, clean, I hope, has been used to gag her.  He drags her, feet first, into a closet.)  DONNIE PFASTER:   Now, be good and don't cause me any problems.  (DONNIE PFASTER closes the closet door and goes into her bathroom. SCULLY hears water running and her phone ringing. DONNIE PFASTER pushes ""play"" on her CD player.  The song, ""Don't Look Any Further"" comes on.)  CUT TO: (MULDER lying in his bed with the phone to his ear. Finally, he hangs up and gets up.)  CUT TO: (DONNIE PFASTER filling SCULLY's tub with water and bubble bath.)  CUT TO: (SCULLY in the closet peering under the crack at the bottom of the door at her gun on the bedroom floor. She looks up at the door handle.)  CUT TO: (DONNIE PFASTER testing the bath water and turning it off.)  CUT TO: (SCULLY standing up in the closet and opening the door with her tied hands.)  CUT TO: (DONNIE PFASTER picks up a bottle of her shampoo.  Willow Lake, made by the Lamour Corporation in Minneapolis.)  MUSIC:   Ooh   Oh, whoa, whoa  Oh Someone to count on In a world ever changin' Here I am Stop where your standin'  CUT TO: (SCULLY hiding under the bed as DONNIE PFASTER passes her into another room.)  MUSIC:   What you need is a lover Someone to take over Oh, girl Don't look any further And it's strange When you think of the chances That we've both been in a state of mind Too cool to be careless Lookin' for the right thing  (SCULLY, grunting, makes her way along the floor to the other side of the bed where her gun is.  Meanwhile, DONNIE PFASTER, in search of candles, has gone into her kitchen, taken out a silverware caddy and removed a knife and a pair of scissors.)  MUSIC:   Oh, baby Don't look any further Tonight We're gonna take a trip to paradise Rockin' all night long Baby Daylight Daylight I'll still be lookin' in your heavenly eyes And we'll go on and on  (SCULLY is close to her gun, but she freezes in fear, blood trickling out of her nose as DONNIE PFASTER passes her again.)  MUSIC:   Day-o, umba day-o Mambu ji ay-o Don't look any further Day-o, umba day-o Mambu ji ay-o Don't look any further  (In the bathroom, DONNIE PFASTER is lighting a LOT of candles. Scully apparently likes them a lot.  There must be 40-50 in the room that he has collected throughout the apartment.)  MUSIC:   Someone to count on In a world ever changing Here I am, baby Stop right where you're standing What you need is a lover Someone to take over Here I am, babe Don't look any further, further...  (SCULLY gets her feet, clad in very cute fuzzy slippers, through her hands, putting her hands in front of her.  She keeps crawling to the gun over the shards of mirror on the bedroom floor.  In the living room, DONNIE PFASTER turns off the stereo and heads for SCULLY.  SLOW MOTION sequence starts. MULDER enters the front door and draws his gun on DONNIE PFASTER. CarriK's lip reading ability says that he says ""Put your hands up!"" and puts his hand on DONNIE's shoulder.  DONNIE PFASTER does not obey. Instead, he turns his head as SCULLY enters the room, her hands unbound, the gag around her neck and her gun hanging loosely in her right hand. She is focused solely on DONNIE PFASTER.  It looks like MULDER asks, ""Did he hurt you?"" [Others say he says, ""Don't shoot!"", but according to TD's brand new super-duper VCR he definitely says ""Did he hurt you?""] We see a bullet casing hit the floor, SCULLY's face illuminated by a gunshot, DONNIE PFASTER having a slight reaction as the bullet passes through him, MULDER turning as the overhead light is blown out by the bullet.  MULDER stares at SCULLY who is still holding the gun where she fired it into DONNIE PFASTER's ribcage. She is horrified at what she has done.  The screen goes black as a gunshot rings out.)  SCENE 19  (SCULLY's apartment, later.  Crime scene.  MULDER has been talking to a policeman.  He sees SCULLY, now with a shawl wrapped around her pajamas, go into her bedroom and close the door.)  MULDER:    Excuse me.  COP:   Yeah. Sure.  (SCULLY closes the window and takes off the shawl. MULDER enters SCULLY's bedroom.)  MULDER:    If you want to pack some things, we can get out of here.  SCULLY:    Yeah.  (SCULLY pulls her Bible back out of the drawer and looks at MULDER.)  MULDER:    You can't judge yourself.  SCULLY:    (sitting on the bed)   Maybe I don't have to.  MULDER:    The Bible allows for vengeance.  SCULLY:    But the law doesn't.  MULDER:    (leaning into her)   The way I see it... he didn't give you a choice.  And my report will reflect that... in case you're worried.  Donnie Pfaster would've surely killed again if given the chance.  SCULLY:    He was evil, Mulder.  I'm sure about that, without a doubt. But there's one thing that I'm not sure of.  MULDER:    What's that?  SCULLY:    Who was at work in me.  Or what...  what made me... what made me pull the trigger.  MULDER:    You mean if it was God?  SCULLY:    I mean...  what if it wasn't?  (MULDER has no answer.  [Fade to black]  [THE END]   Return to the Scripts Page ",7,7
SCULLY:    The prisoner... the man you were guarding in this room. What happened to him?  ,7,7
SCULLY:    You didn't see him?  ,7,7

SCULLY:    I can think of a neater one.  How you convinced me to drop everything and get on the first plane to Los Angeles.  ,7,8
"SCULLY:    Yeah, I saw the picture.  And as for this Amazing Maleeni turning his head all the way around, LIKE YOU SAID, MULDER:  neat trick.  ",7,8
SCULLY:    (crossing to him)  But... I'd guess this event was completely removed from the subsequent murder.  ,7,8
SCULLY:    Don't you?  ,7,8
"SCULLY:    Mulder, his head was cut off.  ",7,8
SCULLY:    Why are you talking like Tony Randall?  ,7,8
"SCULLY:    Mulder, I admit that I don't know how it happened but I still say that it was a murder.  So what's your theory?  ",7,8
SCULLY:    Who's the heckler?  ,7,8
"SCULLY:    Hang on a second.  Let me see this.  That heckler was pretty hard to impress wouldn't you say? Look, and then he just takes off in a huff.  ",7,8
"SCULLY:    Well, it's worth checking out, don't you think?  ",7,8
"SCULLY:    Ah, but observe.  His discarded soda cup.  The hand may be quicker than the eye but it still leaves fingerprints.  ",7,8

"SCULLY:    Well, you're on videotape heckling the deceased.  ",7,8
SCULLY:    No.  ,7,8
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,7,8
"SCULLY:    Well, thank you, Mr. LaBonge.  We'll, uh... be in touch.  ",7,8
"SCULLY:    Mulder, I think that professional jealousy is as good a motive for murder as any.  ",7,8
SCULLY:    If I can get Mr. Maleeni into an autopsy bay hopefully we can put this issue to a rest as soon as possible.  ,7,8
"SCULLY:    All right, I'm stumped... and I think I'm supposed to be.  ",7,8
"SCULLY:    Well, first of all, and sorry to disappoint you but, uh, Mr. Maleeni's head didn't just magically fall off.  It was very carefully sawed.  Very slow and exacting work probably with a fine-tooth meat saw. And check out this little detail.  ",7,8
"SCULLY:    Spirit gum, Mulder.  It held the head to the body.  Just barely, of course.  ",7,8
"SCULLY:    Well, no.  As far as I can tell this man died of advanced coronary disease.  ",7,8
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,7,8
"SCULLY:    No.  Which makes it even stranger still because, as far as I can tell this body has been dead for over a month.  I see signs of refrigeration.  ",7,8
"SCULLY:    Well, somebody performed yesterday.  ",7,8
SCULLY:    He certainly does.  ,7,8
SCULLY:    He might try and run.  ,7,8
SCULLY:    No.  We are investigating the death of a magician who called himself the Amazing Maleeni.  ,7,8
"SCULLY:    Yes, we know.  We checked his next of kin.  ",7,8
"SCULLY:    Do you know magic, Mr. Pinchbeck?  ",7,8
SCULLY:    No kidding.  What now?  ,7,8
"SCULLY:    Why do people do magic?  To, uh, impress, to delight to gain attention.  ",7,8
"SCULLY:    Well, maybe we should consult an expert.  Someone who knows magic, who's seen the greatest trick in the world.  Maybe he can help us figure that out.  ",7,8
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,7,8
SCULLY:    The feeling of pride that comes from performing your civic duty.  ,7,8
SCULLY:     It would seem not.  ,7,8
"SCULLY:    Not even you, I guess.  ",7,8
SCULLY:    Thanks for your expert opinion.  I guess we're right back where we started.  ,7,8
SCULLY:    What would this be doing in Maleeni's van?  ,7,8
"SCULLY:    It's your handwriting, is it not?  Mr. Alvarez please answer the question.  ",7,8
SCULLY:    We ran it through the California criminal history database to which you seem to be quite well known.  ,7,8
SCULLY:    In Herman Pinchbeck's van.  Where were you last Thursday?  ,7,8
"SCULLY:    (friendly warning)   Don't leave town, Mr. Alvarez.  ",7,8
SCULLY:    Maybe he wasn't so adept.  LaBonge certainly doesn't have a high opinion of his skills.  ,7,8
SCULLY:    It's in your right hand.  ,7,8
"SCULLY:    (smiling, impressed)   Ah...  That's not bad.  ",7,8
SCULLY:    (warning him)    Mulder...  ,7,8
SCULLY:    (deadpan)   Ah-choo.  ,7,8
SCULLY:    (amused)  Amazing!  ,7,8
SCULLY:    And what's the point?  ,7,8
SCULLY:    And that's what's happening in this case?  ,7,8
SCULLY:    By whom?  Maleeni is already dead.  ,7,8
"SCULLY:    We'd like to have a word with you, Mr. Pinchbeck.  ",7,8
SCULLY:    (shocked)   Mulder?!  ,7,8
SCULLY:    You're Maleeni?  ,7,8
SCULLY:    We know.  Gambling debts to a man named Alvarez.  ,7,8
SCULLY:    So why'd you play poker with him?  ,7,8
"SCULLY:    Well, why did you lose?  You could have manipulated the cards, right?  ",7,8
"SCULLY:    Well, you could, right?  ",7,8
"SCULLY:    Well, sir... what does any of this have to do with your twin brother being found decapitated at the Santa Monica Pier?  ",7,8
SCULLY:    You found him dead of a heart attack.  ,7,8
SCULLY:    And so you refrigerated the body...  ,7,8
SCULLY:    And you posed as an amputee to allay suspicion that you weren't your brother.  ,7,8
"SCULLY:    You, uh, still haven't explained why you left your brother's body at the pier or why you arranged to have his head fall off.  ",7,8
"SCULLY:    What are you looking for, Mulder?  ",7,8
"SCULLY:    Mulder, it says here something about a robbery attempt yesterday.  ",7,8
"SCULLY:    (looking at the clipboard)   Yeah, well, Mr. Pinchbeck was the employee who signed out the truck.  He knew the schedule.  ",7,8
"SCULLY:    Maybe, maybe not.  ",7,8
"SCULLY:    (on phone)   Yes... Okay. All right  All right, thank you.  ",7,8
SCULLY:    He's still in the city lockup where he's been since we arrested him last night.  It certainly doesn't look like he did this.  Lots of fingerprints.  ,7,8
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,7,8
SCULLY:    Does it?  ,7,8
SCULLY:    Cissy Alvarez.  Convicted bank robber.  ,7,8
SCULLY:    Well... saving up for a rainy day?  ,7,8
SCULLY:    Billy LaBonge.  ,7,8
SCULLY:    I think releasing these two may be a bit premature.  ,7,8
SCULLY:    Last night the Cradock Marine Bank was robbed of $1.8 million.  This morning that entire amount was found in the possession of Mr. Cissy Alvarez.  ,7,8
SCULLY:    He'll need a good lawyer.  ,7,8
SCULLY:    That's what you wanted us to think.  ,7,8
SCULLY:    It was a setup from the start.  You played poker with him and you made sure that you lost big.  ,7,8
SCULLY:    LaBonge planted Alvarez's marker in Maleeni's van and made sure we found it   (Flashback of MULDER looking at the marker)   and then you used Alvarez's greed in order to ensnare him and then orchestrated the attempted bank robbery in order to implicate him.  ,7,8
"SCULLY:    And then last night the two of you robbed the bank, and planted the money at ALVAREZ's place.   (Flashback of money falling out of the ceiling)  ",7,8
"SCULLY:    With your expertise at sleight of hand, pick pocketing, and escapology I think you were both able to get out of here by pilfering a guard's key.  ",7,8
SCULLY:    We saw through their magic.  ,7,8
SCULLY:    (surprised)  You picked his pocket?  ,7,8
SCULLY:    What are you talking about?  ,7,8
SCULLY:    We were the last piece of the puzzle.  ,7,8
"SCULLY:    You know, Mulder, there's still one thing that you haven't explained.  ",7,8
SCULLY:    How the Amazing Maleeni was able to turn his head completely around.  ,7,8
SCULLY:    I do.  I'll show you.  Observe.  ,7,8
SCULLY:    Well... magic.  ,7,8
SCULLY:    Snakes.  ,7,9
"SCULLY:    Oh, my God.  ",7,9
SCULLY:    But it says here that he was found dead in his car.  ,7,9
"SCULLY:    But, uh, what happened to all the snakes?  ",7,9
"SCULLY:    So you think that, uh... Mr. Chirp was murdered?  ",7,9
"SCULLY:    Maybe it's symbolic.  I mean, serpents and religion have gone hand in hand.  They've represented the temptation of Eve-- Original Sin. They've been feared and hated throughout history as they've been thought to embody Satan-- to serve Evil itself.  ",7,9
"SCULLY:    These particular serpents actually were serving Evil? (""looks"" at him)  Are you going to type that on our travel request?  ",7,9
SCULLY:    But...?  ,7,9
SCULLY:    Animus enough to motivate a murder?  ,7,9
SCULLY:    Snake handling.  I didn't learn that in catechism class.  ,7,9
SCULLY:    The nearest one?  Probably ten miles from here.  ,7,9
"SCULLY:    Rattlesnakes and medieval visions of damnation.  Well, I for one, feel a whole lot closer to God.  ",7,9
"SCULLY:    Or believing in flying saucers, for that matter.  ",7,9
SCULLY:    Something slithery?  ,7,9
SCULLY:    Why is it empty?  ,7,9
"SCULLY:    (nervously, holding out her badge, not taking her eyes off the snakes)   Reverend Enoch O'Connor, we're Federal Agents.  We're, uh... with the FBI.  ",7,9
SCULLY:    (still nervous)   We're here to ask you questions about a former member of your church--  Jared Chirp.  ,7,9
SCULLY:    A test?  What do you mean?  ,7,9
SCULLY:    Are you speaking about the Devil's test or your test?  ,7,9
"SCULLY:    Tennessee.  Snakes.  Thank you, Mulder.  Thank you so much. I say we arrest him and catch the first flight out of here.  ",7,9
"SCULLY:    Well, Mulder, there are other people in his congregation.  ",7,9
"SCULLY:    (gently)  Gracie we're investigating the leader of your former church, Enoch O'Connor.  We believe that he may have had something to do with what happened here tonight.  ",7,9
"SCULLY:    Gracie, that sounds like something that Reverend O'Connor might say.  Now, you're not a member of that congregation anymore. And I understand that's because you're someone who thinks for herself.  ",7,9
SCULLY:    I think I'll check around back.  ,7,9
SCULLY:   Oh!!  ,7,9
SCULLY:    Gracie.  You still don't believe your father did it?  ,7,9
SCULLY:    I guess it's looking less and less like he's a suspect.  ,7,9
"SCULLY:    Well, if so, Mulder, the jury's still out.  I just spoke to his doctors.  It's a toss-up as to whether he's going to pull through this.  ",7,9
SCULLY:    He's not receiving it.  ,7,9
"SCULLY:    Gracie stepped in.  She's trying to forbid treatment on religious grounds.  It's not clear whether she has a legal claim to do it, but she says that it's up to God as to whether he lives or dies.  ",7,9
"SCULLY:  (she nods slightly)    Well, more to the point, Mulder, what if she did this?  She told me that her father would be judged as he deserves.  ",7,9
"SCULLY:    Well, she grew up around snakes, Mulder.  Who's to say she isn't every bit as adept at handling them as he is?  ",7,9
"SCULLY:    So, what's he scared of?  ",7,9
"SCULLY:    Though I don't understand it, O'Connor's church exerts a strong pull on these people.  ",7,9
"SCULLY:    It's an intolerant culture, Mulder.  ",7,9
"SCULLY:    You're saying that you, Fox Mulder, would welcome someone telling you what to believe?  ",7,9
"SCULLY:    Which turns out to be more or less the case.  Based on this, that means that Jared can't be the father of Gracie's baby.  ",7,9
SCULLY:    So maybe he was killed because he discovered the truth.  ,7,9
SCULLY:    How could Gracie have possibly gotten him out of here?  ,7,9
"SCULLY:    Mulder, he was on his deathbed; that's impossible.  And besides, what's his motivation?  ",7,9
"SCULLY:    (shocked, but understanding)  Enoch O'Connor is.  ",7,9
SCULLY:    How is she?  ,7,9
SCULLY:  (to the COP)  What happened here?  Where's the baby?  ,7,9
SCULLY:    Snakes. (to WOMAN)    She gave birth to snakes.  ,7,9
SCULLY:    Where are you going?  ,7,9
"SCULLY:    Gracie, it's Agent Scully.  We're taking you to the doctor right now, okay?  ",7,9
"SCULLY:    Can you tell me what happened, Gracie?  ",7,9
"SCULLY:    You're safe, Gracie.  My partner's gone after him. Gracie, you're going to be okay.  He can't hurt you anymore.  ",7,9
SCULLY:    Where's Mulder?  ,7,9
SCULLY:    Mulder?!  ,7,9
SCULLY:    Still no trace...  even though every law enforcement agency in Tennessee's out looking for him.  ,7,9
"SCULLY:    He's just a man, Mulder.  Just like O'Connor.  ",7,9
"SCULLY:    I'd say if it was, you passed with flying colors.  You're alive, aren't you?  ",7,9
SCULLY:    Mulder?  ,7,10
SCULLY:    What are you doing?  ,7,10
SCULLY:    About?  ,7,10
SCULLY:    Mind if I turn on a light?  ,7,10
SCULLY:    Skinner is royally pissed.  At you.  ,7,10
"SCULLY:    He expected a report at noon.  He waited.  Now he sent me to find you, to get it.  ",7,10
SCULLY:    They had to move on the case.  The media got wind of the police findings and they're going to broadcast them.  The parents are being held for further questioning.  ,7,10
SCULLY:    The facts would say otherwise.  There's no sign of a break-in.  Both parents were home when the girl disappeared.  ,7,10
SCULLY:    Why?  ,7,10
SCULLY:    Is it the media or just our own morbid fascination with the killing of an innocent?  ,7,10
"SCULLY:    What are you doing, Mulder?  ",7,10
SCULLY:    That's not what I mean.  You're personalizing this case.  You're identifying with your sister.  ,7,10
SCULLY:    There are a lot of good agents up there in Skinner's office who do not have the patience for this.  ,7,10
"SCULLY:    You told them that they were wrong, Mulder.  ",7,10
SCULLY:    Why did you do it?  ,7,10
"SCULLY:    That was utterly irresponsible, Mulder.  It was out of line and it was without any basis in reality.  ",7,10
SCULLY:    She was convicted in a court of law.  ,7,10
"SCULLY:    I can't explain it, Mulder, but you're doing exactly what I said.  You're personalizing this case.  ",7,10
SCULLY:    How?  ,7,10
"SCULLY:    What if they're dead, Mulder?  Don't go looking for something you don't want to find.  ",7,10
SCULLY:    Sir?  ,7,10
SCULLY:    I need to have a word with Agent Mulder.  ,7,10
"SCULLY:    No, it can't, sir.  ",7,10
"SCULLY:    (softly)   Mulder, your mom's dead.  ",7,10
SCULLY:    Mulder?  ,7,10
SCULLY:    What is it?  ,7,10
SCULLY:    Was there a note?  ,7,10
SCULLY:    Mulder...  ,7,10
SCULLY:    We never truly know why.  ,7,10
SCULLY:    Who?  ,7,10
"SCULLY:    (rising, pleading)   Oh, no, Mulder.  Please don't ask me to do this.  ",7,10
"SCULLY:    An autopsy, Mulder?  I mean, it's one thing on a stranger but you're my friend, and she's your mother...  ",7,10
"SCULLY:    How could she know that, Mulder?  ",7,10
SCULLY:    (walking toward him)  Mulder...  ,7,10
"SCULLY:    Your mother killed herself, Mulder.  I conducted the autopsy.  She was dying of an incurable disease.  An untreatable and horribly disfiguring disease called Paget's Carcinoma.  She knew it.  There were doctor's records.  She didn't want to live.  ",7,10
SCULLY:    Mulder   ,7,10
"SCULLY:    Mulder, she was trying to tell you to stop.  To stop looking for your sister. She was just trying to take away your pain.  ",7,10
SCULLY:    Hi.  ,7,10
SCULLY:    It's been a hard night for him.  ,7,10
SCULLY:    It's not a good...  ,7,10
"SCULLY:    Well, then you better book three.  ",7,10
"SCULLY:    Mulder, we just got here.  ",7,10
SCULLY:    How do you know that?  ,7,10
"SCULLY:    Well, what about the handwritten note?  ",7,10
SCULLY:    Santa Claus.  ,7,10
SCULLY:    Stop.  Turn around.  ,7,10
SCULLY:    It's Amber Lynn LaPierre.  This tape was dated two days before her disappearance.  ,7,10
SCULLY:    What's your name?  ,7,10
SCULLY:    You're under arrest.  You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up the right to remain silent anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to speak with an attorney and to have the attorney present during questioning.  If you so desire...  ,7,10
SCULLY:    You're personalizing this case.  You're identifying with your sister.  ,7,11
"SCULLY:    Mulder, your mom's dead.  ",7,11
SCULLY:    She killed herself.  ,7,11
SCULLY:    You're under arrest.  ,7,11
"SCULLY:    (deep breath)   Ed Truelove was 19 when he committed his first murder.  He was working as a janitor at an elementary school and they needed someone to play Santa Claus.  He never got over the feelings it aroused. He's admitted to all of it, Mulder.  24 separate murders.  (no response) But he refuses to take blame for Amber Lynn LaPierre.  (she glances at the videtape image)   I was just handed the preliminary forensics report.  (she puts it on the desk)   Her body was not one of those found in the graves. (MULDER continues looking at the pictures)  Mulder, I know you wanted to find her out there.  ",7,11
SCULLY:    I'm talking about your sister.  (MULDER sits up and stretches his neck.)   I know that's who you're looking for.  ,7,11
SCULLY:    Do we know each other?  ,7,11
"SCULLY:    Mr. Piller, are you part of this investigation?  ",7,11
SCULLY:    You're a police psychic.  ,7,11
"SCULLY:    Mr. Piller, you have some interesting references here.  You've, uh, worked with law enforcements in Kashmir, India, Myanmar, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Khyber Pass...  ",7,11
SCULLY:    And did you recover them?  ,7,11
"SCULLY:    Thank you, Mr. Piller, but we have real work to be done.  ",7,11
SCULLY:    Please excuse us.  ,7,11
"SCULLY:    Mulder...  Mulder, please.  ",7,11
"SCULLY:    Mulder, you have been through so much in such a short time -- the death of your mother and the feelings it's brought up for your sister -- you're vulnerable right now.  ",7,11
"SCULLY:    Yes, but this man isn't going to help us find her by his own admission.  ",7,11
"SCULLY:    Because it's foolproof, Mulder.  Nobody is going to disprove it if there's no body.  I mean, that's exactly what this man does.  He gives a, a comforting explanation that a train wreck or an earthquake that everyone can live with but the fact is the bodies are still buried.  ",7,11
SCULLY:    Like your sister.  Mulder...  You told me that all you wanted was for this to be over.  ,7,11
"SCULLY:    Well, then I'm going back to Washington.  There's nothing more to be done here.  ",7,11
SCULLY:    Suspicious of what?  ,7,11
SCULLY:    Compensatory for what?  ,7,11
SCULLY:    You mean his sister wasn't abducted.  ,7,11
SCULLY:    But why alien abduction?  ,7,11
SCULLY:    So what do you think happened to his sister?  ,7,11
SCULLY:    You think that his sister's dead?  ,7,11
SCULLY:    Someone owes it to Mulder.  ,7,11
"SCULLY:    Well, this particular wound has never healed.  And Mulder deserves closure, just like anyone.  ",7,11
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Mulder, it's me.  I found something, and I'm standing here not quite believing what it is.  ",7,11
SCULLY:   (on phone)    I don't know if you know this but there was a special Treasury Department investigation into Samantha's disappearance.  ,7,11
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Well, I'm in your mother's house and I found a piece of a document that she burned -- a document that matches one that I found in the treasury investigation file.  But she had the original, Mulder.  ",7,11
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    This is the document that effectively calls off the search for your sister, Mulder.  And it's signed with the initials ""C.G.B.S.""  ",7,11
SCULLY:   (on phone)    C.G.B. Spender.  The Smoking Man.  He was involved with this back in '73.  ,7,11
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Mulder, you told me you believe that he's the man that killed your father.  That he's the man who's done nothing but confound your work.  Who's come close to killing you and here he's ordering people to stop looking for your sister.  ",7,11
"SCULLY:   (on phone, surprised)    You don't want to press him?  ",7,11
SCULLY:    Hello?  ,7,11
SCULLY:    (calmly)   You can start by putting out that cigarette.  ,7,11
SCULLY:    All but why you can't just come to the door and knock.  ,7,11
SCULLY:    You're sick.  ,7,11
SCULLY:    What do you want?  ,7,11
SCULLY:    You've wanted that since 1973... when you ordered an end to the search for Agent Mulder's sister.  Your initials are on that document.  ,7,11
SCULLY:    Why not?  ,7,11
SCULLY:    You're a liar.  If you knew that she was dead why didn't you say something earlier? Why now?  ,7,11
SCULLY:    So you just let Mulder believe that she was alive for all these years.  ,7,11
"SCULLY:    When did you come up with this story, Mulder?  Because yesterday, when I spoke to you, you said that the Smoking Man wasn't involved.  ",7,11
SCULLY:    Mulder ...  ,7,11
"SCULLY:    Mulder, I spoke to him.  The Smoking Man, C.G.B. Spender, whatever his name is...  ",7,11
"SCULLY:    Mulder, why would he lie now?  I mean, think about it. It hurts me to tell you this.  ",7,11
"SCULLY:    Oh, he led you, Mulder.  He led you from the moment that he met you.  ",7,11
"SCULLY:    That's not all, Harold.  Your history of mental illness.  You were institutionalized, diagnosed with schizophrenia.  ",7,11
"SCULLY:    Well, whoever's lived here hasn't lived here in a long time.  ",7,11
SCULLY:    What do you mean?  ,7,11
"SCULLY:    (sarcastically)   Oh, yay.  A seance.  I haven't done that since high school.  ",7,11
SCULLY:    How will we know?  ,7,11
SCULLY:    Mulder?  What are you doing?  ,7,11
SCULLY:    What is?  ,7,11
SCULLY:    Mulder?  ,7,11
SCULLY:    Let's get out of here.  ,7,11
SCULLY:    Go get some sleep.  ,7,11
"SCULLY:    I got it, Mulder.  I couldn't believe it when I saw it.  It was like it was looking for me.  Sergeant's blotter, 1979.  ",7,11
SCULLY:    The description matches your sister.  ,7,11
"SCULLY:    Mulder, it's almost noon.  ",7,11
SCULLY:    Maybe she went by another name.  She could have given them a name other than her own.  ,7,11
SCULLY:    Her medical examination is normal.  Her mental state -- it says here she was exhibiting signs of paranoia.  ,7,11
"SCULLY:    (reading)   ""Diagnosis of condition incomplete... tests unavailable.""  ",7,11
"SCULLY:    Mulder, wait.  ",7,11
SCULLY:    That was 1979.  It was 21 years ago.  I don't even know where to begin and .. and we don't even have a record here of a doctor signing her out.  ,7,11
SCULLY:    What's wrong?  ,7,11
SCULLY:    Are you ready for it?  ,7,11
SCULLY:    Do you want me to go talk to her myself?  ,7,11
SCULLY:    Okay.  ,7,11
SCULLY:    (holding out her badge)   Arbutus Ray?  ,7,11
SCULLY:    Are you the same Arbutus Ray that worked as a nurse at the Dominic Savio Memorial Hospital in 1979?  ,7,11
SCULLY:    I'd like to ask you about a patient you treated... a 14-year-old girl.  ,7,11
SCULLY:    So you saw her dead?  ,7,11
SCULLY:    What do you mean?  ,7,11
SCULLY:    So they took her?  ,7,11
"SCULLY:    Mulder, where did you go?  ",7,11
"SCULLY:    Mulder, what happened?  Are you sure you're all right?  ",7,11
SCULLY:    FBI!  ,7,12
SCULLY:    We're investigating a case!  ,7,12
SCULLY:    We're investigating a case.  ,7,12
"SCULLY:    Mulder, what the hell is going on here?  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    (smiling sweetly)   Agent Mulder, can we have a word a second.  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    ""What is it""?  Mulder, have you noticed that we're on television?  ",7,12
SCULLY:    But it's a camera and it's recording.  ,7,12
SCULLY:    It's recording everything that you are saying.  Do you understand that?  I just want to make sure that you're clear on that.  ,7,12
"SCULLY:    My point being, Mulder, that we're on a case.  ",7,12
SCULLY:    Wh ...  ,7,12
"SCULLY:    Look, Mulder, you want to talk about werewolves to me you can knock yourself out.  I may not agree with you but at least I'm not going to hold it against you but this...  Mulder, this could ruin your career.  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    I don't want me looking foolish, Mulder.  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    I'm gonna call Skinner, Mulder.  ",7,12
SCULLY:    I'm sure he's going to want to say a couple of words about this.  ,7,12
"SCULLY:    Guys, give it a rest, huh?  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    Well... those weren't teeth marks, Mulder.  They turned out to be insect bites...  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    Individual welts or stings of some sort.  Together, they just looked like a larger pattern especially when we want them to... (peripherally glances at the camera)  ... although it was an understandable conclusion that I'm sure anybody would have made.  ",7,12
SCULLY:    He said that the FBI has nothing to hide... and neither do we.  ,7,12
"SCULLY:    (surprised)   Oh.  All right, good.  ",7,12
SCULLY:    No.  You go with someone else.  ,7,12
"SCULLY:    Guys, watch out.  I'm a doctor.  ",7,12
SCULLY:    Last call from this phone was made to the Road Club-- Ricky Koehler requesting roadside assistance for his flat tire.  He asked them to hurry.  He said he didn't feel safe.  ,7,12
SCULLY:    What's that?  ,7,12
SCULLY:    Somebody lost a nail.  ,7,12
"SCULLY:    Check out this color, Mulder-- blood red.  ",7,12
SCULLY:    You didn't see his-his attacker?  ,7,12
"SCULLY:    So, you didn't see anything at all?  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    Did you, uh, did you see a woman?  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    (dryly, not looking up)   Oh, yeah.  ",7,12
SCULLY:    Bubblegum pink.  ,7,12
SCULLY:    Don't run!  FBI.  ,7,12
SCULLY:    FBI.  Chantara! Go...  ,7,12
SCULLY:    Don't run.  It's okay.  It's okay.  It's all right.  ,7,12
SCULLY:    Can I see your hands please?  ,7,12
"SCULLY:    May I see your hands, please?  It's okay.  Let me see your hands, please.  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    Earlier this evening, a man was attacked.  He was badly slashed and you realize this places you at the crime scene.  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    You can tell us, Chantara.  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    Come on, Chantara.  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    ""Mi novio""--  her boyfriend.  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    Chantara, no one's going to kill you.  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    Chuco Munoz, the man himself.  Only distinguishing feature is a tattoo on his skull.  ",7,12
SCULLY:    What do you mean?  ,7,12
"SCULLY:    Yeah, well, maybe not by himself but he's probably got friends, right?  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    Couple of days, maybe a week.  He didn't attack Ricky Koehler, that's for sure.  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    What is it, Mulder?  What?   (she looks in the car)  Oh.  ",7,12
SCULLY:    Where'd you find that?  ,7,12
"SCULLY:    Well, you did, that's correct.  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    Mulder, that's not exactly... (sighs)  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    Okay, well, for the sake of this argument...  ",7,12
SCULLY:    ...How would one catch something like that?  ,7,12
SCULLY:    Chantara Gomez back to Wetzel.  ,7,12
"SCULLY:    But you're missing someone, Mulder.  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    Edy. Steve and Edy.   They're a part of this chain, too and, and according to your theory they would have been attacked, right?  ",7,12
SCULLY:    (confused)   I'm sorry. Are you talking to me?  ,7,12
"SCULLY:    Steve, are you going to be all right?  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    (calmly)   Look, you guys, Steve, Edy.  The reason why we are here is because we are concerned about your safety.  We're concerned about your lives.  You witnessed a violent attack right across the street from your house.  ",7,12
SCULLY:    Think we should take them to a motel?  ,7,12
"SCULLY:    Oh, God.  More of you?  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    I'm afraid not.   Mulder, what next?  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    Well, I want to examine Chantara Gomez.  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    Your ""contagion of fear""?  ",7,12
SCULLY:    No.  ,7,12
SCULLY:    But if I can't figure out what this thing was at least I can figure out what it wasn't.  ,7,12
"SCULLY:    Chantara Gomez, age 31, apparent cause of death is the fracturing of the second and third cervical vertebrae.  There are contusions consistent with, uh, choking or throttling uh, by very powerful hands.  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    Well, let's see if we can put that story to rest, shall we?  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    (taking pictures)   That's... that's completely inaccurate.  This, uh, investigation is... is...  We're moving towards an apparent chain of victims and I seriously doubt that we're going to find anything that looks like a contagious pathology here.  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    (confident)   Look, this is obviously a murder, here.  I mean, this woman died of a broken neck, right?  Not the hantavirus.  ",7,12
"SCULLY:   Nobody.  I just... I was, um... It was a figure of speech.  ",7,12
SCULLY:    (examining the body)  We're trying to look for the killer.  ,7,12
SCULLY:    (to the camera)   Because the FBI has nothing to hide.  ,7,12
"SCULLY:    Look, there is no ulterior motive here.  It's just...  Are you going to help me out here, or what?  ",7,12
SCULLY:    Thank you.  ,7,12
"SCULLY:    Look, I...  ",7,12
SCULLY:    Call 911.  Call 911!  911!  ,7,12
SCULLY:    Get out of here!  Come on!  ,7,12
"SCULLY:    It's not the hantavirus.  It looks for all the world like the hantavirus but I can promise you that it's not.  Well, I mean, she-she exhibited all the symptoms-- the hemorrhagic fever, the severe chills, acute shock.  But, I mean, the thing is that they all developed in a matter of seconds. And the hantavirus doesn't kill that fast.  I mean, no virus in the world kills that fast.  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    Because she kept bringing it up.  I mean, it was like the power of suggestion, Mulder.  She was-she was standing there.  She was saying that she was afraid of contagion and then all of a sudden, she just...  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    No, no, no, Mulder.  I was standing right here.  I didn't see anything.  (indicates the camera)   They didn't see anything.  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    (softly)  The hell I wasn't afraid, Mulder.  I don't know what's going on here.  ",7,12
"SCULLY:    Mulder, you were walking around with him for three hours and you didn't see anything ...  ",7,12
SCULLY:    It's the battering ram.  ,7,12
SCULLY:    Wind?  ,7,12
SCULLY:    Damn it.  I hate you guys.  ,7,12
SCULLY:    Deputy Wetzel?  ,7,12
SCULLY:    He's alive.  ,7,12
SCULLY:    We're up here!  ,7,12
SCULLY:    You think the Deputy stopped it whatever it was?  ,7,12
"SCULLY:    (sounds disappointed for him)   You didn't get the proof that you wanted, Mulder.  ",7,12
SCULLY:    (voice)   It's going to be a hard one to write up.  ,7,12
"SCULLY:    (reading, not impressed)   ""To protect all proprietary or intellectual property owned by F.P.S., a private California corporation under the harshest penalty of law.""  ",7,13
SCULLY:    F.P.S.  ,7,13
SCULLY:    (a rhetorical question)   Video games.  ,7,13
SCULLY:    I can get in the Pentagon easier than this.  ,7,13
SCULLY:    How about a simple explanation as to why we're here?  ,7,13
SCULLY:    Okay.  ,7,13
SCULLY:    What kind of accident?  ,7,13
SCULLY:    How did the victim die?  ,7,13
SCULLY:    Was there equipment involved?  ,7,13
SCULLY:    What's your business here?  ,7,13
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,7,13
SCULLY:    Only there's a dead body between you and untold riches.  ,7,13
SCULLY:    This man's been shot.  ,7,13
SCULLY:    What do you call this?  ,7,13
SCULLY:    You say this weapon is a toy but this man clearly has gunshot wounds through his...  ,7,13
"SCULLY:    (taking out her phone)   Well, the next call's going to be to the local P.D.  ",7,13
"SCULLY:    Well, connections or not, you've got a murder victim here.  ",7,13
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Yes, this is Special Agent Dana Scully with the FBI...  ",7,13
"SCULLY:    My partner, Agent Mulder.  This is Detective LaCoeur.  ",7,13
"SCULLY:    Mulder, you're not serious.  ",7,13
"SCULLY:    Mulder, that's any voluptuous vixen out of any number of video games.  ",7,13
"SCULLY:    Yeah, but even if they had, she's not real.  She's a character. She's some immature hormonal fantasy.  ",7,13
SCULLY:    Who's Daryl Musashi?  ,7,13
SCULLY:    What's he doing here?  ,7,13
"SCULLY:    Mulder, why does this game have the effect of reducing grown men back to moony adolescence?  ",7,13
SCULLY:    Mulder.  ,7,13
SCULLY:    Do you want me to autopsy the body?  ,7,13
"SCULLY:    (into tape recorder)   Preliminary external examination of deceased, a twenty-ish male, name listed only as ""Retro,"" offers no additional clues as to actual cause of death.  ",7,13
"SCULLY:    (pause, she clicks the recorder on again)   Scratch that.  Cause of death is from a large entry wound at the sternum, resulting in trauma to the internal organs and blood loss.  Wound is consistent with a high-velocity impact from a large projectile which passed through a three-ply Kevlar jacket. (pause, the recorder is turned on again)   Scratch that.  Wound is result of high-velocity impact from an unknown object, which even if it did enter the body left no damn trace evidence whatsoever-- no powder burns, no chemical signatures of any kind of explosive propellant ...  ",7,13
"SCULLY:    I thought I was on to something.  You know, Mulder, this suit holds more than just exploding paint cells.  It measures the player's vital signs from the heart rate to the extant body chemistry and then sends that information back to the computer.  Then when a player is shot a battery pack sends a 12-volt jolt that keeps him from getting up until the game is over.  ",7,13
"SCULLY:    Yeah, well, if only that were the case.  ",7,13
"SCULLY:    I thought at first that maybe the uh, suit had malfunctioned, that one of the charges had blown inward but, unfortunately, that wasn't the case either.  ",7,13
"SCULLY:    Yeah, wasted on a stupid game.  ",7,13
SCULLY:    Dressing up like high-tech warriors to play a futuristic version of Cowboys and Indians?  What kind of moron gets his ya-yas out like that?  ,7,13
"SCULLY:    Mulder, what - what purpose does this game serve except to add to a culture of violence in a country that's already out of control?  ",7,13
"SCULLY:    You think that taking up weapons and creating gratuitous virtual mayhem has any redeeming value whatsoever?  I mean, that the testosterone frenzy that it creates stops when the game does?  ",7,13
"SCULLY:    Well, that must be why men feel the great need to blast the crap out of stuff.  ",7,13
"SCULLY:    Yeah, I've seen it. A computer-animated woman, Mulder, with a computer-animated weapon.  ",7,13
"SCULLY:    Pictures don't kill people, Mulder, guns kill people.  ",7,13
SCULLY:    You get the feeling these men have something better to do?  ,7,13
SCULLY:    Was she read her rights?  ,7,13
"SCULLY:    For the record, can you state your name, please?  ",7,13
SCULLY:    (interrupting)   I'm sorry.  Your real name?  ,7,13
SCULLY:    No.  ,7,13
"SCULLY:    Well, you're not upsetting me, Miss, uh...  ",7,13
SCULLY:    You say that you have no knowledge of Ivan Martinez or a company known as First Person Shooter or F.P.S.?  ,7,13
SCULLY:    Would it surprise you to know that you have been placed at a crime scene in the offices of F.P.S.?  ,7,13
SCULLY:    You might want to start telling the truth.  ,7,13
SCULLY:    What?  ,7,13
SCULLY:    They paid you to scan your body?  ,7,13
SCULLY:    Hello.  ,7,13
"SCULLY:    Phoebe?   Hey, you okay?  ",7,13
SCULLY:    Where is everybody?  Where's Ivan?  ,7,13
"SCULLY:    Well, we need to talk to him right away about a woman named Jade Blue Afterglow.  He scanned her body and he created a character out of her.  He put her in the game.  ",7,13
SCULLY:    What for?  ,7,13
SCULLY:    Hey...  ,7,13
SCULLY:    Somebody's shooting at them.  ,7,13
SCULLY:    Mulder?  ,7,13
SCULLY:    (exasperated)   He's getting his ya-yas out.  ,7,13
SCULLY:    Where's Mulder?  ,7,13
"SCULLY:    I said, where's Mulder?  Maybe you guys didn't hear me. Come on, guys.  Where is he?  ",7,13
SCULLY:    I saw what he did.  But where did he go?  ,7,13
SCULLY:    I saw where he went.  I want to know where he is.  Is there a door?  Or an exit?  Or some kind of passageway that he could have used?  ,7,13
SCULLY:    Yeah.  Easy for you to say.  ,7,13
SCULLY:    What do you mean?  ,7,13
SCULLY:    Where?  ,7,13
"SCULLY:    Yes, but where's the game?  ",7,13
SCULLY:    What?  ,7,13
"SCULLY:    Yeah, and you're going to be counting teeth.  ",7,13
SCULLY:    The game has disappeared.  ,7,13
SCULLY:    Jade Blue Afterglow--  does that ring a bell?  ,7,13
"SCULLY:    Oh, you'd remember her.  ",7,13
SCULLY:    Hey.  Phoebe.  ,7,13
SCULLY:    You knew about her?  Then it was you.  You scanned that woman's body.  ,7,13
SCULLY:    But why?  ,7,13
SCULLY:    I wouldn't be so sure.  ,7,13
"SCULLY:    But, Phoebe, she is still a killer.  I can't explain it, but she is. And you put her in that game.  ",7,13
"SCULLY:    You've got to destroy her, Phoebe.  ",7,13
"SCULLY:    Well, there's got to be some way.  There's got to be some vulnerability or a weakness somewhere.  ",7,13
SCULLY:    Her name is Maitreya.  ,7,13
SCULLY:    She's input herself into the game.  We have to download her.  ,7,13
"SCULLY:    Frohike, what's wrong?  What is that?  ",7,13
SCULLY:    What?  ,7,13
SCULLY:    Hey.  No fair picking on a girl.  ,7,13
SCULLY:    There's no picture.  ,7,13
SCULLY:    That's not the game.  ,7,13
SCULLY:    Where's Mulder?  ,7,13
SCULLY:    Shut the game down.  ,7,13
"SCULLY:    Well, just turn it off!  ",7,13
SCULLY:    Look!  We have to get him out of there!  ,7,13
SCULLY:    You okay?  ,7,13
SCULLY:    Mulder!  ,7,13
SCULLY:    Mulder?  ,7,13
"SCULLY:    ""T-h-e-e-f.""  I assume it's supposed to be t-h-I-e-f-- ""thief.""  ",7,14
"SCULLY:    Well, that's certainly one question.  I've got many.  ",7,14
"SCULLY:    To be fair, I might have used the words ""Mulder, how is this an X-File?""  ",7,14
SCULLY:    Which would certainly shine the light of suspicion on them.  ,7,14
SCULLY:    Which is why the police are rightly wondering if Dr. Thalbro killed himself.  ,7,14
"SCULLY:    I'll admit, Mulder this is not an open and shut case.  But, uh  (whispering back over her shoulder)   it doesn't make it an X-File.  ",7,14
SCULLY:    Dirt?  ,7,14
"SCULLY:    (sighs)  Hexcraft, as in, uh, putting a curse on someone?  Murdering them magically?  ",7,14
"SCULLY:    No, hexcraft. I mean, I'll buy that as the intent here.  It certainly jibes with the evidence.  I say we talk to the family.  ",7,14
SCULLY:    I'll always keep you guessing.  ,7,14
"SCULLY:    Sir, can you think of any enemies that your father-in-law might have made? Maybe inadvertently through his medical practice or a business dealing, perhaps?  ",7,14
SCULLY:    Uh-huh.  ,7,14
SCULLY:    Uh-huh.  ,7,14
SCULLY:    (finally looking up at him)  Kuru.  ,7,14
SCULLY:    From eating the brains of their relatives.  ,7,14
"SCULLY:    Practically speaking, Mulder, Kuru doesn't even exist anymore.  Not in New Guinea and certainly not in the U.S.  But this man's cerebellum and his striatum clearly show signs of it, Mulder.  I mean, these... these amyloid plaques?  His brain is riddled with them.  ",7,14
"SCULLY:    Yeah, stark raving, among other things but in this case, stark raving mad enough to slit his own throat and hang himself.  ",7,14
"SCULLY:    Mulder, that's what his autopsy shows.  From the wound pattern to the blood spray... this man did it to himself, there's no question.  ",7,14
SCULLY:    We understand you've made a diagnosis.  ,7,14
SCULLY:    In San Francisco?  It's unheard of.  Maybe in... in Central Africa...  ,7,14
"SCULLY:    Sir, regardless of the particulars I think it's clear that there was an intruder in your home and I think it would be prudent for you to accept our protection and help us to identify  this person.  ",7,14
"SCULLY:    Oh, yeah, Mulder, win him over.  ",7,14
SCULLY:    What do you suggest?  ,7,14
SCULLY:    It's dirt.  ,7,14
SCULLY:    Goofer dust?  ,7,14
SCULLY:    (skeptically)   A voodoo doll.  ,7,14
SCULLY:    Which would mean what?  ,7,14
SCULLY:    You believe that your wife was murdered?  ,7,14
"SCULLY:    Sir, we can't help you if you withhold information from us.  ",7,14
SCULLY:    You gave her morphine.  Lots of it.  ,7,14
SCULLY:    What makes you think it's her father?  ,7,14
"SCULLY:    If Lynette Peattie was Carlos the Jackal I would've had an easier time tracking her down.  There's no birth certificate, no social security number, nothing.  ",7,14
SCULLY:    Her name shows up once in the records of a Vista inoculation program-- 1981. The Allegheny mountains of West Virginia.  ,7,14
"SCULLY:    That's when her father, one Oral Peattie refused to allow her to be inoculated against polio.  But there's no address for him.  There's no record of him whatsoever.  So, Mulder, why are we exhuming this girl?  ",7,14
SCULLY:    Here?  His daughter's grave?  ,7,14
SCULLY:    Lynette Peattie's body.  ,7,14
"SCULLY:    Well, what's important is that he believes that.  At any rate, if he can't find you he can't hurt you.  ",7,14
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Scully.  ,7,14
SCULLY:   (on phone)    What happened?  ,7,14
"SCULLY:   (on phone, quietly)    I didn't see anybody following us.  ",7,14
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Okay.  ,7,14
SCULLY:    Stay where you are.  ,7,14
"SCULLY:    Oh!  Oh, God!  ",7,14
"SCULLY:    (gasping in pain, disoriented)   I don't know.  I can't...  ",7,14
SCULLY:    (panicked)  I can't see.  ,7,14
SCULLY:    Just stay where you are!  Stay down.  ,7,14
SCULLY:    Leave him alone!  ,7,14
SCULLY:    Doctor...  What's happening?  ,7,14
SCULLY:    Dr. Wieder!  ,7,14
"SCULLY:    She's going back to her people after all.  You know, Mulder, I would've made the same call... as a doctor... if I was certain that I couldn't save her life and she was in that much pain... I would've done what Wieder did.  ",7,14
SCULLY:    Except maybe it's not.  ,7,14
"SCULLY:    Jason McPeck, Goochland, Virginia.  ",7,15
SCULLY:    Yeah. His parents refused treatment on religious grounds. His faith forbids medical aid and so Jason's cure was delivered by angels.  ,7,15
"SCULLY:    Well, spontaneous remission, Mulder, isn't completely unheard of. So-called miracle recoveries attributable to no clear cause or reason.  ",7,15
SCULLY:    DARPA.  ,7,15
SCULLY:    No.  ,7,15
"SCULLY:    As far as I can tell, I was the only one to whom it was delivered.  ",7,15
"SCULLY:    It's not a case, Mulder.  ",7,15
"SCULLY:    (showing her badge)   Hi, I'm Dana Scully with the, uh, Federal Bureau of Investigation.  Are you Mrs. McPeck?  ",7,15
SCULLY:    I'm here about your son.  ,7,15
"SCULLY:    Ah, no. I was just hoping to better understand what happened to him.  May I ask is he okay?  ",7,15
SCULLY:    And you say that you saw angels?  ,7,15
SCULLY:    May I ask what they looked like?  ,7,15
SCULLY:    And what did they say?  ,7,15
SCULLY:    He pinched you?  Where?  ,7,15
SCULLY:    What the hell are you doing?  ,7,15
SCULLY:    Get out of my car!  ,7,15
SCULLY:    You got your light.  Now get out.  ,7,15
SCULLY:    So you want to give it to us.  ,7,15
SCULLY:    You think I'm fooled by this?  ,7,15
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Yes, I need a trace on a D.C. area phone number. I need an address.  ",7,15
"SCULLY:    I'm sorry, I, uh, made a mistake.  ",7,15
"SCULLY:    Look, is this necessary?  I just walked through the wrong door.  ",7,15
SCULLY:    Look...  ,7,15
SCULLY:    You obviously knew that I would.  ,7,15
SCULLY:    (no time for flattery)   Please.  ,7,15
SCULLY:    (sighs)   What are you dying of?  ,7,15
"SCULLY:    So, you want to use me to clear the slate... to make you a respectable person.  It won't work.  ",7,15
SCULLY:    I'm here.  Where is it ...  this miracle cure of yours?  ,7,15
SCULLY:    I'll get back to you.  ,7,15
"SCULLY:    (on machine)   Mulder, it's me.  I wanted to let you know that I'll be out of town for a day or two.  It's a family emergency.  I'll... I'll call you when I can.  ",7,15
SCULLY:    (recorded voice)   This is Dana Scully.  I'm not in right now. Please leave a message after the beep.  ,7,15
SCULLY:    (critically)   You're going to smoke?  ,7,15
SCULLY:    Just like that.  ,7,15
SCULLY:    What exactly is it you expect to receive?  ,7,15
SCULLY:    I might if you let me know where we're going.  ,7,15
SCULLY:    I've always trusted Mulder.  ,7,15
"SCULLY:    Wow.  I'm learning a whole other side to you.  You're not just a cold-blooded killer, you're a pop psychologist as well.  ",7,15
SCULLY:    Where are we going?  ,7,15
SCULLY:    And what's her relationship to you?  ,7,15
SCULLY:    Nice to meet you.  ,7,15
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Sir?  ,7,15
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    I'm on the road.  Um, I'm sorry to call you on this line.  ",7,15
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Everything's okay.  I just wanted you to express that to Mulder.  ,7,15
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    No, sir.  That's all right.  Can you tell him that I'll call him later?  Just, just tell him that I'm fine.  ",7,15
SCULLY:    I'm going to the restroom.  ,7,15
"SCULLY:    Mulder, I'm trusting you'll be able to make sense of what's on this tape.  I had no other way of contacting you.  Please try to understand that I weighed the risks.  I couldn't divulge these plans without risking them and I promise you that I weighed everything.  Our current location is northbound on the upstate expressway.  We are driving my FBI fleet sedan.  I will promise I will get these tapes to you as fast as I can.  ",7,15
"SCULLY:    Unadulterated, thank you.  ",7,15
SCULLY:    You drugged me.  ,7,15
SCULLY:    How the hell did I get out of my clothes and into bed?  ,7,15
SCULLY:    Where are we?  ,7,15
"SCULLY:    Well, that wasn't part of the deal.  I don't know what you're up to.  ",7,15
"SCULLY:    It's, uh... It's beautiful.  ",7,15
"SCULLY:    So, your contact's going to join us?  ",7,15
SCULLY:    You extol our great trust but you still haven't told me who he is.  ,7,15
SCULLY:    I'm still not clear what my importance is to this exchange.  ,7,15
SCULLY:    What?  ,7,15
SCULLY:    How?  ,7,15
SCULLY:    Then you would be cured.  ,7,15
SCULLY:    What do I do when I get there?  ,7,15
"SCULLY:    Well, wait.  Where did you get this?  Where did it come from, this science?  ",7,15
SCULLY:    Who developed it?  ,7,15
"SCULLY:    Yes, I'm Scully but I don't believe that we've spoken before or corresponded.  ",7,15
SCULLY:    They shot him.  They killed him and they shot at me.  ,7,15
SCULLY:    (accusingly)  You told me that no one else knew about this.  ,7,15
"SCULLY:    (sighs)   Oh, man.  ",7,15
"SCULLY:    (disgusted)   Yes, I got it.  ",7,15
SCULLY:    I've got to go.  ,7,15
"SCULLY:    (insistent, desperate)    No, it can't be.  It can't be.  It's got to be on there.  ",7,15
SCULLY:    He was here!  These were his offices.  What the hell is this?  ,7,15
"SCULLY:    Mulder, he laid it all out for me.  I recorded it.  I mailed you the tape.  ",7,15
"SCULLY:    This old woman, Marjorie Butters, I met her.  I saw her pictures, her birth certificate...  ",7,15
"SCULLY:    Well, then what about this boy?  This boy with cancer?  You can't deny that.  That's undeniable proof.  ",7,15
"SCULLY:    Mulder, I looked into his eyes.  I swear what he told me was true.  ",7,15
SCULLY:    (voice)   You think he used me to save himself-- at the expense of the human race.  ,7,15
"SCULLY:    (voice)   You may be right... but for a moment, I saw something else in him.  A longing for something more than power.  Maybe for something he could never have.  ",7,15
SCULLY:    Anything?  ,7,16
"SCULLY:    Yeah.  Well, I hope you realize there's no evidence whatsoever that this mystery woman of yours has even committed a crime...  ",7,16
SCULLY:    Though her wardrobe comes close.  ,7,16
SCULLY:     and twice they came up empty-handed.  ,7,16
"SCULLY:    (shrugs)   Well, I hope we catch her, so she can tell us before I have to spend another night here.  You know, Mulder, I don't know about you but I find this all very depressing... This round-the-clock exposure to the seamy underbelly.  ",7,16
SCULLY:    (plaintively)   Mulder...  ,7,16
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Mulder, please tell me I can go home.  ",7,16
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Well, the furnace broke and I can just about see my breath in here.  ",7,16
SCULLY:   (on phone)    That... and I've witnessed a couple hundred things I'd like to erase from my brain.  Eww.  ,7,16
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    But as of yet, no mystery woman.  ",7,16
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Yeah, well not before I die of malnutrition.  ",7,16
"SCULLY:   (on phone, confused)    I'm sorry. What?  ",7,16
"SCULLY:   (on phone, miserable)    Mulder, when you find me dead, my desiccated corpse propped up staring lifelessly through the telescope at drunken frat boys peeing and vomiting into the gutter just know that my last thoughts were of you and how I'd like to kill you.  ",7,16
"SCULLY:   (on phone, whining ) It's a freak show, Mulder.  It's a nonstop parade of every single lowlife imaginable.  ",7,16
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    It's not the same, trust me.  ",7,16
"SCULLY:   (on phone, hopefully)    Are you talking about a reprieve for me?  ",7,16
SCULLY:   (on phone)    That van is back.  ,7,16
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Nothing, Mulder.  I'll talk to you later, okay?  ",7,16
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Mulder?  I am free.  ,7,16
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Mm-hmm.  I'm going to go home, take a shower for, I don't know eight or nine hours, burn the clothes that I'm wearing and then... sleep until late spring.  ",7,16
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Yes, except it's not an X-File, Mulder.  ",7,16
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Oh, no, we caught her, but she isn't a serial killer nor is she a blonde, and she isn't even a she.  ",7,16
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    What I'm talking about is the six missing prostitutes aren't dead, Mulder.  They are alive and well in a halfway house that was set up by this mystery blond who happens to go by the name of Mark Scott Egbert and Mr. Egbert wishes to acquaint lost souls with the teachings of Christ and that's his hook, I guess.  He dresses up like a fellow prostitute to make the girls feel at ease but this vanishing act is no more paranormal than a change of wardrobe, Mulder.  He goes into a place like a, like a woman and he comes out as a man, right under...  ",7,16
"SCULLY:    Exactly.  A wolf in sheep's clothing or I guess, in this case, a sheep in wolf's clothing.  ",7,16
"SCULLY:   (voiceover)   Time passes in moments ...  moments which, rushing past define the path of a life just as surely as they lead towards its end. How rarely do we stop to examine that path, to see the reasons why all things happen, to consider whether the path we take in life is our own making or simply one into which we drift with eyes closed.  ",7,17
"SCULLY:   (voiceover)   But what if we could stop, pause to take stock of each precious moment before it passes?  Might we then see the endless forks in the road that have shaped a life?  And, seeing those choices, choose another path?  ",7,17
SCULLY:    I got the lab to rush the results of...  ,7,17
"SCULLY:    I said, I got the lab to rush the results of the Szczesny autopsy, if you're interested.  ",7,17
SCULLY:    And Szczesny did indeed drown but not as the result of the inhalation of ectoplasm as you so vehemently suggested.  ,7,17
"SCULLY:    Margarita mix, upchucked with about 40 ounces of Corcovado Gold tequila which, as it turns out she and her friends rapidly consumed in the woods while trying to reenact the Blair Witch Project.  ",7,17
"SCULLY:    No, I don't.  ",7,17
"SCULLY:    Crop circles, Mulder?  ",7,17
SCULLY:    Hmm?  ,7,17
SCULLY:    I am.  ,7,17
SCULLY:    I guess I just don't see the point.  ,7,17
SCULLY:    Getting where?  ,7,17
"SCULLY:    Mulder, I still have to go over to the hospital and-and-and finish the final paperwork on the autopsy you had me do.  And, to be honest, it's Saturday and I wouldn't mind, I don't know, taking a bath?  ",7,17
"SCULLY:    What it means, Mulder, is I'm not interested in tracking down some sneaky farmers who happened to ace geometry in high school.  ",7,17
"SCULLY:    And besides, I mean... what could you possibly get out of this? Or learn?  I mean, it's not even remotely FBI-related.  ",7,17
SCULLY:    Mulder...  ,7,17
"SCULLY:    Look, we're always running.  We're always chasing the next big thing.  Why don't you ever just stay still?  ",7,17
"SCULLY:    My name is Dana Scully and I was told I could pick up a postmortem folder for a Ms. Szczesny here.  It's, uh, for the FBI.  ",7,17
SCULLY:    Thank you.  ,7,17
"SCULLY:    Hi, um... I was given the wrong test results.   This, uh, x-ray marked ""D. Waterston"" was in the envelope marked ""Szczesny.""  I was expecting autopsy results.  ",7,17
"SCULLY:    Thank you.  Is the, um... is the ""D. Waterston"" that was on the x-ray is that a Dr. Daniel Waterston?  ",7,17
SCULLY:    Thank you.  ,7,17
"SCULLY:    Um, I'm sorry.  I'm Dr. Scully.  I-I was just in the hospital and...  ",7,17
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,7,17
"SCULLY:    Uh, yes, Dana Scully.  ",7,17
"SCULLY:    I'm sorry, you must be mistaken.  ",7,17
SCULLY:    He has a heart condition?  ,7,17
SCULLY:    Then it's serious.  ,7,17
"SCULLY:    No, that's all right.  But, uh, thanks for your time.  ",7,17
SCULLY:    Yes...  he's a remarkable man.  ,7,17
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Hello?  ,7,17
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    I'm sorry, who is this?  ",7,17
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Maggie.  Is everything all right?  ,7,17
SCULLY:   (on phone)    I'm sorry?  ,7,17
SCULLY:   (on phone)    About what?  ,7,17
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    I don't know, Maggie.  I don't know if I've got time.  ",7,17
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Maggie, can you hang on a second?  I have another call coming through.  ",7,17
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Hello?  ,7,17
SCULLY:    Hello?  ,7,17
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Mulder, aren't you supposed to be on a plane?  ",7,17
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Right.  Guess I lost track of time.  ,7,17
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    No, I just walked in. Why?  ",7,17
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Mulder, I'm not going.  ",7,17
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    I'm out for the evening, Mulder.  ",7,17
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Look, um... why don't you leave that address on my answering machine and, uh, I'll try for you.  ",7,17
SCULLY:    I'm sorry.   I-I have the wrong room.  ,7,17
SCULLY:    Hi.  ,7,17
SCULLY:    Surely not the Devil.  ,7,17
"SCULLY:    How are you feeling, Daniel?  ",7,17
SCULLY:    You're extremely lucky you called that diagnosis.  ,7,17
"SCULLY:    (softly, looking away for a moment)   Daniel...  ",7,17
"SCULLY:    So, how did you happen to be here in Washington?  ",7,17
SCULLY:    Is that why you wanted to see me?  To remind me once again what a bad choice I made?  ,7,17
"SCULLY:    You scare me, Daniel.  ",7,17
SCULLY:    You never accepted my reason for leaving.  ,7,17
SCULLY:    But you understood why.  ,7,17
SCULLY:    I'm sorry I came.  ,7,17
SCULLY:    I just wanted to make sure you were okay.  ,7,17
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Scully.  ,7,17
SCULLY:   (on phone)    She researches crop circles?  ,7,17
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Mulder you want me to...?  ,7,17
SCULLY:    Hi.  I'm...  ,7,17
SCULLY:    You were...  ,7,17
"SCULLY:       Right.  That's strange.  Um, I-I'm Agent Scully.  I'm-I'm here on behalf of my partner.  ",7,17
"SCULLY:    For the FBI, as odd as that may sound.  ",7,17
"SCULLY:    No, thank you.  I think I need some fresh air.  ",7,17
"SCULLY:    Yes, I... I mean, yes, I-I'm just a little shaken.  I... a near car accident, I think.  It's nothing, really.  ",7,17
SCULLY:    I'm sorry?  ,7,17
"SCULLY:    Look, I-I don't mean to be rude but I really don't have much time.  ",7,17
"SCULLY:    Uh, to be honest, I don't know exactly what it is that you do.  ",7,17
SCULLY:    I really should be going.  ,7,17
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Hello.  ,7,17
SCULLY:    I was summoned.  ,7,17
SCULLY:    Prednisone?  That won't complicate cardiac arrhythmia. Not if it's just a short burst.  ,7,17
SCULLY:    How did she even find out?  ,7,17
SCULLY:    What things?  ,7,17
SCULLY:    Bad how?  ,7,17
SCULLY:    You divorced.  ,7,17
SCULLY:    Where did you go?  ,7,17
SCULLY:    When?  ,7,17
SCULLY:    (also softly)   Daniel...  you didn't move here for me?  ,7,17
"SCULLY:    Oh, God.  ",7,17
SCULLY:    You've come at such a strange time.  ,7,17
SCULLY:    (shaking her head)   I don't know what I have.  I mean...  your x-rays were in the wrong envelope.  I never would have even known you were here if it wasn't for a mix-up.  It's just...  ,7,17
SCULLY:    I want everything I should want at this time of my life. Maybe I want the life I didn't choose.  ,7,17
SCULLY:    Nurse!  We have a code in here!   Nurse!  ,7,17
"SCULLY:    He's in v-fib, get his head.  ",7,17
SCULLY:    In!  ,7,17
SCULLY:    200 joules.  All clear?  ,7,17
SCULLY:    300 joules.  ,7,17
SCULLY:    Clear!  ,7,17
"SCULLY:    Epinephrine, one milligram, I.V. Push.  Now!  Who's paying attention?!  ",7,17
SCULLY:    Clear!  ,7,17
SCULLY:    We have a pulse.  ,7,17
SCULLY:    Okay.  Thank you.  ,7,17
"SCULLY:    Uh, I'm looking for Colleen.  ",7,17
SCULLY:    I just need to speak with her that's all.  ,7,17
"SCULLY:    I'm sorry that I was rude before.  I'm a medical doctor and a scientist and, you're right, I don't know what it is that you do ... but there was something that you said that I wanted to ask you about.  ",7,17
"SCULLY:    I have a friend who's ill, and, um... I had a strange feeling today-- just a short while ago, actually-- that he may be dying from a more serious condition than anyone realizes.  ",7,17
SCULLY:    Hmm... Yes.  ,7,17
SCULLY:    What are you saying that I saw?  ,7,17
SCULLY:    But he has a heart condition.  ,7,17
SCULLY:    Yes.  It's so strange.  ,7,17
SCULLY:    I'm sorry.  ,7,17
SCULLY:    But how?  ,7,17
SCULLY:    I'm sorry?   I was just going up to see your father.  ,7,17
SCULLY:    Since when?  ,7,17
"SCULLY:    Maggie, to be honest, I left so that there wouldn't be hell in your lives.  ",7,17
SCULLY:    We have nothing but Dr. Waterston's welfare in mind here.  ,7,17
SCULLY:    I understand that.  What's taking place here is an alternative approach.  ,7,17
SCULLY:    I just wanted to help him.  It seemed like nothing else was working.  ,7,17
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Hello?  ,7,17
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Maggie, what's...?  ",7,17
SCULLY:    Daniel?  ,7,17
SCULLY:    You were slipping away.  No one thought you'd come out of this. I'm still in shock.  ,7,17
SCULLY:    I was afraid it didn't work.  ,7,17
"SCULLY:    Daniel, that ""crap"" may have just saved your life whether you're open to it or not.  ",7,17
"SCULLY:    I spoke at length to Maggie.  It's time... that you took responsibility for the hurt you caused in your family.  It's no accident that you got sick, Daniel.  You've been running from the truth for ten years.  ",7,17
SCULLY:    Maybe the reason you're alive now is to make up for that. To make it up to Maggie.  ,7,17
"SCULLY:    (voice breaking slightly)   No.  I'm not the same person, Daniel. I wouldn't have known that if I hadn't seen you again.  ",7,17
SCULLY:    Excuse me!  ,7,17
SCULLY:    Mulder?  ,7,17
SCULLY:    But you're supposed to be in England.  ,7,17
SCULLY:    What happened?  ,7,17
"SCULLY:    Maybe sometimes nothing happens for a reason, Mulder.  ",7,17
"SCULLY:    Nothing.  (she smiles)   Come on, I'm make you some tea.  ",7,17
SCULLY:    What part?  ,7,17
"SCULLY:    Mmm, I didn't say my whole life changed.  ",7,17
"SCULLY:    Mmm, and I didn't say that God spoke back.  I said that I had some kind of a vision.  ",7,17
SCULLY:    I once considered spending my whole life with this man. What I would have missed.  ,7,17
SCULLY:    What if there was only one choice and all the other ones were wrong?  And there were signs along the way to pay attention to.  ,7,17
SCULLY:    Who's taking credit for it?  ,7,18
"SCULLY:    Uh, Christ's Church.  Isn't that, uh, Cardinal O'Fallon's church?  ",7,18
SCULLY:    Um...  He's one of the most powerful men in the church today. His name often comes up as a possibility for the first American pope.  ,7,18
SCULLY:    (in the same tone of voice that she might say doggie poop) A screenwriter?  ,7,18
"SCULLY:    Of course, I'm too young to remember but, uh, wasn't he some kind of a '60s campus radical, like a Jerry Rubin or Mario Savio?  ",7,18
SCULLY:    Just paperwork.  ,7,18
"SCULLY:    Mulder, we should have a warrant.  ",7,18
"SCULLY:    Mulder, sorry to denigrate a third of your Trinity, but, uh, looks like Hoffman was killed by one of his own bombs.  ",7,18
"SCULLY:    Yeah, well, it appears he was a master calligrapher as well. Look, Mulder, they've got gum arabic and sodium hydroxide here.  (reacting to the smell)   Whoo, these would be used to, uh, to age the ink and the paper prematurely.  It's a... it's a forger's trick.  ",7,18
"SCULLY:    Well, it's pretty rusty but it looks like some kind of lost Gospel.  A gospel of Mary Magdalene, and, uh, an account of Christ's life on Earth after the Resurrection.  ",7,18
"SCULLY:    Yeah. It's a heretical text, Mulder-- mythical, I should say, but long rumored to be in existence.  ",7,18
SCULLY:    I think the question is: What would Hoffman be doing forging them?  ,7,18
SCULLY: I'm sure this place is crawling with rats.  ,7,18
"SCULLY:    Now, Wayne, I'm sure that it was dark in there and that your eyes were playing tricks on you and you've been influenced by ghost stories and horror movies that take place in crypts and graveyards and you hallucinated this vision of these dancing bones trying to reconstruct this bowl.  ",7,18
"SCULLY:    You know, Mulder, I... I know that Federman's bs-ing you, so I'm really hesitant to mention this, but, um... his story reminds me of the Lazarus Bowl.  ",7,18
"SCULLY:    We had this wacky nun in Catholic school-- Sister Callahan-- we used to call her ""Sister Spooky"" 'cause she would tell us scary stories all the time.  ",7,18
"SCULLY:    Well, she would hold up an old piece of wood with a rusty nail in it, and she would say ""this is an actual piece of the cross that Christ's wrist was nailed to.""  Or she'd show us a vial of red liquid and say that it was John the Baptist's blood, or something.  ",7,18
"SCULLY:    Well, she would tell this story of when Jesus raised Lazarus from the dead and she said that there was this old woman who was Lazarus's aunt or something...  ",7,18
SCULLY:    ...who was spinning a clay bowl on a wheel nearby and that Christ's words-- the actual incantation to raise the dead--were recorded in the clay grooves of the pottery just like the way music is recorded into vinyl.  ,7,18
"SCULLY:    (laughing, fingering a piece of the clay bowl)   Well, Sister Spooky says that, uh... that these words in the clay still have the power to raise the dead just like Jesus raised Lazarus.  ",7,18
SCULLY:    What is it?  ,7,18
SCULLY:    Wow.  ,7,18
"SCULLY:    We're not sure.  Either a forger by the name of Micah Hoffman or, uh, someone else in the vicinity of Jesus Christ.  ",7,18
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Scully.  ,7,18
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Why?  ,7,18
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Oh, Mulder, this bowl.  Your buddy Chuck Burks says that it has properties he's never seen before.  ",7,18
SCULLY:   (on phone)    I'll call you after the autopsy.  ,7,18
"SCULLY:    Fracturing of skull and surface abrasions initially consistent with concussive force injuries.  I am, uh, now weighing the heart which is relatively normal, although somewhat large.  ",7,18
"SCULLY:    Oh, my God.  ",7,18
SCULLY:    Who are you?  ,7,18
SCULLY:    Ow!  Damn it!  ,7,18
SCULLY:    In Micah Hoffman's stomach there were traces of red wine and strychnine.  ,7,18
SCULLY:    Mmm.  ,7,18
"SCULLY:    It's possible, Mulder.  ",7,18
"SCULLY:    Mulder... Let's allow the man some dignity, okay?  ",7,18
SCULLY:    Let's get this over with.  ,7,18
"SCULLY:    Oh, my God.  ",7,18
SCULLY:    Mulder...  Do you see what I see?  ,7,18
SCULLY:    Is that Micah Hoffman?  ,7,18
"SCULLY:    Sir, the dead man looked very much like Micah Hoffman. He had Hoffman's I.D. on him...  ",7,18
"SCULLY:    We're off this case, Mulder.  ",7,18
SCULLY:    That's the language that Christ spoke.  (she looks up at MULDER) Did your linguist happen to translate it?  ,7,18
SCULLY:    What is it?  ,7,18
SCULLY:    Lazarus?  ,7,18
"SCULLY:    So, uh... you created a Christ in these forgeries that was more suited to your particular world view?  ",7,18
SCULLY:    So why didn't O'Fallon and the Elders go outside the church for authentification?  ,7,18
SCULLY:    Remorse?  ,7,18
SCULLY:    Plan 9 From Outer Space?  ,7,18
SCULLY:    How about Hoffman's Roadrunner to O'Fallon's Wile E. Coyote?  ,7,18
SCULLY:    Mulder...  ,7,18
SCULLY:    Do you think it's at all possible that Hoffman is really Jesus Christ?  ,7,18
SCULLY:    No.  ,7,18
"SCULLY:    Well, yes, I know that.  ",7,18
SCULLY:    Maybe true faith is really a form of insanity.  ,7,18
SCULLY:    (emphatically)   No.  I'm directing it at myself and at Ed Wood.  ,7,18
SCULLY:    How...?  ,7,18
SCULLY:    You've seen this movie 42 times?  ,7,18
SCULLY:    Doesn't that make you sad?  It makes me sad.  ,7,18
"SCULLY:    (resigned)   California, here we come.  ",7,18
SCULLY:    Hi.  ,7,18
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Hey, Mulder, it's me.  What are you doing?  ",7,18
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    I'm, uh, packing.  Just, you know, getting ready for our trip back to D.C. tomorrow.  ",7,18
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Well, that's because people can't really come back from the dead, Mulder.  I mean, ghosts and zombies are just projections of our own repressed cannibalistic and sexual fears and desires.  They are who we fear that we are at heart-- just mindless automatons who can only kill and eat.  ",7,18
"SCULLY:   (on phone, smiling)    Oh, I see.  So it's just that we never get to stay with them long enough to see the gentler side of the undead.  ",7,18
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Yeah.  ,7,18
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Wow, he's really gone Hollywood.  ",7,18
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    You know, Mulder, speaking of Hollywood, I think that Tea Leoni has a little crush on you.  ",7,18
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    I think that Shandling likes you a bit, too.  ",7,18
"SCULLY:    Shh, Mulder, sit down.  ",7,18
SCULLY:    Been looking all over for you.  ,7,18
SCULLY:    I got a page from the Washington Bureau.  Micah Hoffman was murdered tonight.  Murdered in his own home by Cardinal O'Fallon who then hanged himself.  A murder-suicide.  ,7,18
SCULLY:    Wow... It's all over now.  ,7,18
SCULLY:    Pretty silly.  ,7,18
"SCULLY:    Well, hopefully, the movie will tank.  ",7,18
"SCULLY:    I think the dead are beyond caring what people think about them. Hopefully we can adopt the same attitude.  (suppressing a laugh, she smiles at him)   You do know that there aren't real dead people out there, right? That this is a movie set?  ",7,18
SCULLY:    Well... We're alive.  And we're relatively young and Skinner was so tickled by the movie..  ,7,18
SCULLY:    That he has given us a Bureau credit card to use for the evening.  ,7,18
SCULLY:    Come on.  ,7,18
"SCULLY:    Mulder, I have something to confess.  ",7,18
SCULLY:    I'm in love with Associate Producer Walter Skinner.  ,7,18
SCULLY:    This is where the body was found?  ,7,19
SCULLY:    Testimony concerning what?  ,7,19
SCULLY:    And you think that someone made good on these threats?  ,7,19
"SCULLY:    It's almost as if his flesh has been stripped or eaten away.  I mean, an assailant could have thrown acid on him.  ",7,19
SCULLY:    I'll get right on it.  ,7,19
"SCULLY:    Well, the tissue damage on Dr. Scobie's mouth extends all the way down his trachea into his lungs.  His alveoli look like corned beef.  ",7,19
"SCULLY:    No, that's not the case.  There's no acids present, no caustics.  This damage isn't the result of any kind of chemical reaction.  His airways have more or less just been reamed out.  I can tell you what killed him, though... strictly speaking.  ",7,19
"SCULLY:    Hypoxemia.  The, uh, inability to transfer oxygen from the lungs to the bloodstream.  ",7,19
SCULLY:    A bug?  ,7,19
"SCULLY:    I didn't find anything like that, Mulder.  Were you expecting me to?  ",7,19
"SCULLY:    Oh... Well, judging from the condition of the body, I'd say that he died in the same manner as Dr. Scobie.  ",7,19
SCULLY:    What could Morley Tobacco have against a transient from Massachusetts?  ,7,19
"SCULLY:    It's a long shot, Mulder, but it could be some form of contagious agent, like an insect-borne bacterium which would mean that there might be other victims in this building.  ",7,19
"SCULLY:    And the only thing I have to go on medically at this point is Mulder's bug. You know, I know an entomologist at UNC Wilmington-- Dr. Libby Nance.  ",7,19
SCULLY:    Hmm. What are the differences?  ,7,19
SCULLY:    What if such deviations arose from genetic engineering?  ,7,19
"SCULLY:    No. I was thinking about another possibility: ""Transgenomics.""  ",7,19
SCULLY:    It's a form of DNA manipulation-- alterations made on the genetic level.  ,7,19
SCULLY:    Which possibly could have created super bugs.  I guess the real question is could they have become dangerous to humans?  ,7,19
SCULLY:    Thomas Gastall's left lung and bronchus.  ,7,19
"SCULLY:    Hey, Mulder.  Where have you been?  ",7,19
"SCULLY:    Well, take a look at this.  ",7,19
"SCULLY:    They're the larval stage of the tobacco beetle, Mulder and somehow, they have ended up nesting in Thomas Gastall's lungs.  ",7,19
SCULLY:    The larvae must pupate inside the lungs and then once they mature into beetles exit the body en masse.  ,7,19
SCULLY:    Mulder?  ,7,19
"SCULLY:    They're using a deep-suction technique that's been designed for asthma and cystic fibrosis.  And, so far, we're having some luck at clearing his lungs.  ",7,19
SCULLY:    For every one of those things that are in his lung tissue there may be a dozen eggs that have yet to be hatched.  ,7,19
SCULLY:    His pulmonary tissue is riddled with them and they're going to hatch.  It's just ... (she sighs)   we're buying time.  ,7,19
SCULLY:    I'm thinking he inhaled them.  ,7,19
"SCULLY:    Well, the tobacco beetle lives out its life cycle on or around the tobacco plant.  That's where it lays its eggs.  If those genetically-altered beetles that we found did that then maybe the eggs survived the processing into cigarettes.  ",7,19
"SCULLY:    Right-- like spores or pollen, somehow small enough to be airborne.  ",7,19
SCULLY:    Maybe they were around someone who was.  ,7,19
SCULLY:    How do you feel?  ,7,19
SCULLY:    We're looking for someone who may be able to help you-- a Morley test subject by the name of Darrel Weaver.  ,7,19
SCULLY:    Yeah.  Mr. Weaver seems to have some kind of tolerance or immunity and we're hoping that once we find him we'll be able to figure out how to treat you.  ,7,19
SCULLY:    Mulder...  ,7,19
SCULLY:    Doctor!  ,7,19
SCULLY:    His SAT's down to 72.  Get some O-2 on him and call the Code.  ,7,19
SCULLY:    There's more now than there were six hours ago.  ,7,19
"SCULLY:    No.  No, I...  He's too weak for thoracic surgery.  He-he'd die on the table.  ",7,19
"SCULLY:    (voice cracking)   I'd say for the time being, we just wait.  ",7,19
SCULLY:    Not good.  Let's get the blood work on this man.  ,7,19
SCULLY:    Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Get me 30 milligrams of methyl pyrrolidinyl pyridine.  ,7,19
SCULLY:    Yeah.  (to SKINNER)   I think this could save Mulder's life.  ,7,19
SCULLY:    Hey.  Good to be back?  ,7,19
"SCULLY:    Well, you'll be interested to know that Morley Tobacco has subpoenaed all of our files on the case.  They seem extremely interested in your recovery.  ",7,19
"SCULLY:    He's, uh, well enough to have been moved to the hospital ward at Raleigh Correctional.  ",7,19
"SCULLY:    Well, his fingertips were stained yellow with it.  He was a four-pack-a-day smoker-- far heavier than any of the focus group members who died.  You know, nicotine is extremely poisonous.  It's actually one of the oldest known insecticides.  ",7,19
"SCULLY:    Well, once we loaded your system up with enough of it, it acted as a sort of chemotherapy...  except it almost stopped your breathing at the same time.  ",7,19
SCULLY:    You're not going to start smoking.  ,7,19
SCULLY:    Mulder...  ,7,19
"SCULLY:    Good.   Well, Skinner's waiting for us in his office.  ",7,19
"SCULLY'S VOICE:   Well, we have two young men in the car who say you do know something.  ",7,20
"SCULLY'S VOICE:   A woman who, by both young men's accounts fits your description.  ",7,20
SCULLY:    But it's not?  ,7,20
SCULLY:    ... but you're not.  ,7,20
SCULLY:    Seven years?  ,7,20
SCULLY:    Not even I would be so farfetched.  ,7,20
"SCULLY:    What I'm thinking, Mulder, is how familiar this seems.  Playing Watson to your Sherlock.  You dangling clues out in front of me one by one. It's a game, and... and, as usual, you're, you're holding something back from me.  You're not telling me something about this case.  ",7,20
"SCULLY:    Okay, so these agents were investigating something.  ",7,20
"SCULLY:    Something... much like what they themselves were almost killed by.  Uh, something they came into contact with.  Uh... Third party?  ",7,20
SCULLY:    Two third parties.  Twins?  Relatives?  A doppelganger?  ,7,20
"SCULLY:    (like she's playing Twenty Questions)   A corporeal likeness that appears unbidden from the spirit world the sight of which presages one's own death or... a double, conjured into the world by a technique called bilocation ...  ",7,20
"SCULLY:    ... which in psychological terms represents the person's secret desires and impulses committing acts that the, uh, real person cannot commit himself ... or herself?  ",7,20
"SCULLY:    Mulder, the slide, please.  ",7,20
SCULLY:    (proudly claps her hands)   Yes!  ,7,20
"SCULLY:    Maybe you should take another look at that photograph, Mr. Zupanic.  Five-foot three, red hair.  Maybe I can jog your memory.  ",7,20
"SCULLY:    Are you still pleading ignorance, Mr. Zupanic?  Is that not you in last year's Fourth of July parade?  ",7,20
SCULLY:    And who's that sitting next to you?  ,7,20
"SCULLY:    Try Betty Templeton.  We can't find her, Mr. Zupanic. She seems to have left town in a hurry.  ",7,20
SCULLY:    Mm-hmm.  ,7,20
"SCULLY:    Alderwood, blue house.  ",7,20
"SCULLY:    Mr. Zupanic, do you have any reason to be lying to us?  ",7,20
"SCULLY:    Thank you, Mr. Zupanic.  I've no doubt we'll be in touch with you.  ",7,20
SCULLY:    That Mr. Zupanic not only knows Betty Templeton and where we can find her but that he is hip to whatever she's into and that I should take a look at that house he mentioned on Moreton Bay Street while you go and find out from Mr. Zupanic what it is exactly that he's clearly hiding about Betty Templeton.  ,7,20
"SCULLY:    Well, I guess that's why they put the ""I"" in the FBI.  ",7,20
"SCULLY:    So I take it from your posture, Mulder, you've solved this case.  ",7,20
SCULLY:    Narrowed it down to where?  ,7,20
SCULLY:    Bert Zupanic is a boxer?  ,7,20
SCULLY:    So what? We wait around Kansas City for a couple of days until we can talk with this woman?  ,7,20
"SCULLY:    Well, finding Betty Templeton won't solve this case, Mulder. Not unless we find Lulu Pfeiffer.  ",7,20
"SCULLY:    Our doppelganger who lived, until yesterday in a pink house on Moreton Bay Street, but she's not a manifestation, Mulder, she's real and so is the path of destruction that she's left in her wake.  Though there seems to be no connection of any kind between these two women, Betty Templeton and Lulu Pfeiffer have traveled city to city across 17 U.S. States, one alternately trailing the other for the past 12 years and wherever they have been, mayhem has followed.  ",7,20
"SCULLY:    It's not just car accidents and fistfights, Mulder.  It's house fires and explosions and even riots.  ",7,20
SCULLY:    Mr. Zupanic?  ,7,20
"SCULLY:    Uh, there was an incident.  You were struck by flying glass.  ",7,20
"SCULLY:    Would that be Betty or Lulu, Mr. Zupanic?  ",7,20
"SCULLY:    'Cause they're the ones who caused this and they'll do it again if we can't find them.  Where are they, Mr. Zupanic?  ",7,20
"SCULLY:   (on phone, voice)    Scully.  ",7,20
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Betty Templeton?  ,7,20
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Well, Lulu Pfeiffer works at Koko's, too.  And that's exactly what Lulu says about Betty, Mulder.  Except she says that this is the end of the line, that she's not leaving Kansas.  ",7,20
SCULLY:   (on phone)    What's going on here?  ,7,20
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Well, I think that this is more than just physical proximity, Mulder.  I think that these women have some kind of a psychic connection.  ",7,20
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    She just took off, Mulder.  She left work and she drove away.  ",7,20
SCULLY:   (on phone)    That's exactly what she's driving.  ,7,20
"SCULLY:    Uh, yes.  I'm looking for someone.  He was here speaking to an employee and, uh, I can't seem to reach him.  ",7,20
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,7,20
SCULLY:    And you don't know where he went?  ,7,20
SCULLY:    How about Internet access?  ,7,20
SCULLY:    Is he in there?  ,7,20
SCULLY:    Can you wake him up for me?  ,7,20
SCULLY:    It's important.  ,7,20
SCULLY:    Mr. Danfous?  ,7,20
"SCULLY:    (very pleasant, very forced smile)   Mr. Danfous, I'm Special Agent Dana Scully with the FBI.  ",7,20
"SCULLY:    It's an FBI title, sir.  ",7,20
"SCULLY:    Mr. Danfous, if you'll let me explain why I'm here we might be able to get you to bed a little bit sooner.  ",7,20
"SCULLY:    Mr. Danfous, through a lot of matching-up of documents that I have been able to compile on the Internet, and by comparing time and space and circumstance and by liberally applying the law of averages...  ",7,20
SCULLY:    I believe that you may be the father of two daughters.  ,7,20
"SCULLY:    Using documents filed by a sperm bank in Sparta, Illinois and by the mothers who may have been impregnated by your donation...  ",7,20
"SCULLY:    Well, be that as it may, sir, it is very likely that you are the biological father.  And it is very important for their safety and for the safety of others that we get as much information as possible about your mother and your father and anything about your family tree that may be able to explain the reactions that are being caused by these two girls.  ",7,20
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Mulder?  ,7,20
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Where have you been?  ,7,20
SCULLY:   (on phone)    What happened to you?  ,7,20
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    I don't know, but I have been able to locate the nature of their connection.  Both women are non-fraternal siblings from the same father.  ",7,20
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Yeah.  He's here in the state pen.  ,7,20
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Well, the biggest thing that I can figure out right now is he's probably the angriest man in the world, Mulder.  ",7,20
SCULLY:    (on phone)   They're both after him?  ,7,20
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Well, if they're the reason it doesn't explain what's happening, what's causing this phenomenon or how we're going to make it stop.  ",7,20
SCULLY:    Mr. Zupanic?  ,7,20
SCULLY:    50 million anonymous donations have been made to sperm banks across the U.S.  Most have produced healthy offspring for single mothers or fertility-challenged couples while some of them have not.  ,7,20
"SCULLY:    Bert Zupanic and his non-fraternal biological sibling both small-time bank robbers, part-time pro wrestlers, both with too many idiosyncratic behaviorisms to list stood a 27-million-to-one chance of ever meeting but they did.  ",7,20
SCULLY:    Betty Templeton and Lulu Pfeiffer products of different mothers but the same father-  ,7,20
"SCULLY:    ... an angry drifter now doing time for counterfeiting-- chanced to meet 12 years ago, but couldn't seem to avoid each other's compulsively identical mannerisms, mannerisms attributable to their perpetually angry father.  ",7,20
"SCULLY:    I've been thinking hard about that, Mr. Saperstein.  I would like to say it has something to do with balance in the universe, the attraction of opposites and the repulsion of equivalents, or that over time, nature produces only so many originals that when two original copies meet that the result is often unpredictable.  ",7,20
"SCULLY:    If four should meet, the result is...  well, suffice to say it's better just to avoid these encounters altogether and at all costs.  I think Agent Mulder would agree with me.  ",7,20
SCULLY:    Morning.  ,7,21
SCULLY:    Nice to meet you.  ,7,21
"SCULLY:    Look, Mulder, all I'm saying is...  ",7,21
"SCULLY:    But there is a condition called microstomia-- ""small mouth""-- which is, uh, it's brought on by the disease scleroderma and it's the overproduction of collagen and it can actually reduce a person's mouth to a tiny little opening.  ",7,21
"SCULLY:    (small grin)   Well, there's always nasal aplasia-- the complete absence of a nose.  ",7,21
"SCULLY:    Yeah, but what we're talking, Mulder, is medical-- physiological-- not criminal.  Not as far as I can see.  ",7,21
SCULLY:    Mulder...  ,7,21
"SCULLY:    That's a little... out of place, wouldn't you say?  ",7,21
SCULLY:    Hi. We're looking for a Mr. Anson Stokes.  ,7,21
"SCULLY:    Well, do you happen to know when he's coming back?  ",7,21
"SCULLY:    Well, we are, uh, Agents Mulder and Scully from the FBI.  ",7,21
"SCULLY:    (yeah, buddy, whatever tone)    Okay...  ",7,21
"SCULLY:    And the, uh... unfortunate condition that he's found himself in.  Would you happen to know anything about that?  ",7,21
SCULLY:    Chemicals?  ,7,21
SCULLY:    Okay.  ,7,21
"SCULLY:    Well, according to Gilmore he was standing right where I am when it happened.  ",7,21
"SCULLY:    Apparently, everything is left as it was.  ",7,21
"SCULLY:    Well, it's too bad, Mulder.  Underneath all this dust, this furniture is really wonderful.  ",7,21
"SCULLY:    Mulder, this furniture is expensive, very expensive.  ",7,21
"SCULLY:    My point is that, uh... there's a lot of money sitting around here and maybe something's missing.  ",7,21
"SCULLY:    I don't know-- jewelry.  I mean, Anson Stokes opened up this storage unit and then he just disappeared.  ",7,21
SCULLY:    Mm-hmm. There's your crime: Theft.  ,7,21
SCULLY:    Well...  ,7,21
SCULLY:    Ouch.  ,7,21
SCULLY:    That's the woman from the trailer.  ,7,21
SCULLY:    Mm-hmm.  ,7,21
SCULLY:    It is.  His dental records are a match.  He was found about half a mile from his house.  He was probably hit by a car or a truck or... something.  ,7,21
"SCULLY:    Yes, he is.  ",7,21
"SCULLY:    You know, Mulder, in the seven years that we've been working together I have seen some amazing things, but this?  This takes the cake.  It's... it's going to change the boundaries of science.  ",7,21
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,7,21
SCULLY:    How's that?  ,7,21
SCULLY:    You don't mean what I think you mean?  ,7,21
"SCULLY:    Well, what does any of that have to do with this?  ",7,21
SCULLY:    But how?  ,7,21
"SCULLY:    Uh, I think that I should stay here with the body.  I mean, I... you know, I don't think it's a good idea to leave him unguarded.  You know, this is truly amazing.  ",7,21
SCULLY:    (happy whisper to the body as she closes the door)   Bye.  ,7,21
SCULLY:    I have a group of researchers flying in from Harvard Medical.  Can't wait to see their faces.  ,7,21
SCULLY:    What's this?  ,7,21
SCULLY:    Benito Mussolini.  ,7,21
SCULLY:    Your mystery woman.  Or someone who looks a lot like her.  ,7,21
"SCULLY:    Well, even if it is her, Mulder, what would she be doing with Mussolini?  ",7,21
"SCULLY:    Uh, he's, uh...  he's invisible... after all... Um...  ",7,21
SCULLY:    He's in there.  ,7,21
"SCULLY:    Oh, I should just shoot myself.  Oh...  I was so happy.  I was so excited. What was I thinking?  An invisible man?  ",7,21
"SCULLY:    I don't know what I saw, Mulder.  I do know that having that kind of proof in my hands it was just too good to be true.  ",7,21
SCULLY:    Why did the body disappear?  ,7,21
SCULLY:    A wish?  Whose wish?  ,7,21
"SCULLY:    His brother, Leslie.  ",7,21
"SCULLY:    The, uh... the fire department just recovered two bodies.  ",7,21
"SCULLY:    Looks like it.  And, uh, Anson Stokes is visible now.  (disappointed)  Of course.  ",7,21
SCULLY:    But what I'd really love an explanation for is how his corpse got from my locked morgue all the way across town to the Mark Twain Trailer Park.  ,7,21
"SCULLY:    I know what he'd say.  He'd say that you're some kind of a jinni from 1,001 Nights or something like that and that you grant people wishes.  ",7,21
SCULLY:    500 years.  ,7,21
SCULLY:    You're saying that you have been a firsthand witness to 500 years of human history.  ,7,21
"SCULLY:    (not believing a word)   ""An Ifrit.""  ",7,21
"SCULLY:    I can't think of anything we have to hold you on.  And, not surprisingly we don't have any evidence of any of this, so, uh...  I think she's free to go.  ",7,21
"SCULLY:    Skinner called me, Mulder.  Is everything all right?  ",7,21
SCULLY:    No.  ,7,21
SCULLY:    Mul...  ,7,21
"SCULLY:    Could you give us a minute, please?  ",7,21
SCULLY:    Like today?  ,7,21
SCULLY:    Wh  Where the hell did she go?  ,7,21
SCULLY:    No... It's got to be hypnotism or mesmerism or  something.  ,7,21
SCULLY:    I thought I did.  ,7,21
"SCULLY:    Mulder, all right, say...  say that you're right.  Say this is what it is.  Then what you're doing is extraordinarily dangerous.  I mean, you even said that yourself.  ",7,21
SCULLY:    (wistfully)   It sounds wonderful.  ,7,21
"SCULLY:    Maybe it's the whole point of our lives here, Mulder-- to achieve that. Maybe it's a process that one man shouldn't try and circumvent with a single wish.  ",7,21
"SCULLY:    Caddyshack,"" Mulder?  ",7,21
SCULLY:    That's what every guy says.  It's a guy movie.  ,7,21
"SCULLY:    So, uh...  What's the occasion?  ",7,21
SCULLY:    Cheers.  ,7,21
"SCULLY:    Well, I'm fairly happy.  That's something.  ",7,21
"SCULLY:    So what was your final wish, anyway?  ",7,21
SCULLY:    So much of the work that we do cannot be measured in standard terms.  ,7,22
"SCULLY:    We open doors with the X-Files, which lead to other doors.  ",7,22
"SCULLY:    (directly)   I believe that there was once a conspiracy.  I believe I was taken by men who subjected me to medical tests, which gave me cancer and left me barren.  ",7,22
SCULLY:    I've seen things that I cannot deny.  ,7,22
"SCULLY:    Oh, Mulder, how many times have they tried to shut us down?  ",7,22
SCULLY:    Did you hurt him?  ,7,22
"SCULLY:    (into phone)   Billy, are you all right?  ",7,22
SCULLY:    (thoughtfully)    I don't know how we could possibly justify the expense.  ,7,22
SCULLY:    Let's go waste some money.  ,7,22
"SCULLY:    You're married, Billy.  ",7,22
SCULLY:    Why not?  ,7,22
"SCULLY:    Agent Scully, Agent Mulder.  ",7,22
SCULLY:    I watched Agent Mulder paint that there seven years ago.  ,7,22
"SCULLY:    Detective?  Did the, uh... deputy carry a .38?  ",7,22
SCULLY:    Three shells were discharged.  I image they could have rolled from up there.  ,7,22
SCULLY:    Was the missing deputy a good cop?  ,7,22
SCULLY:    Married? Single?  ,7,22
"SCULLY:    (showing her badge)   Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Hoese.  We're with the FBI.  ",7,22
"SCULLY:    We, uh... we came to see if there's anything that you could tell us that might help to find your husband.  ",7,22
SCULLY:    What do you see?  ,7,22
SCULLY:    What do you see?  ,7,22
SCULLY:    Once upon a time there was a little baby.  ,7,22
SCULLY:    (outside)   It's me.  ,7,22
SCULLY:    I don't know what's wrong.  ,7,22
"SCULLY:    I, um...  I was starting to get ready for bed and I started to feel really dizzy-- vertigo or something-- and then I just... I started to get chills.  ",7,22
"SCULLY:    No, I just... I just want to get warm.  ",7,22
SCULLY:    Thank you.  ,7,22
SCULLY:    What?  ,7,22
"SCULLY:    Oh, Mulder, I'm going to be fine.  ",7,22
SCULLY:    Who's right?  ,7,22
SCULLY:    How do you know?  ,7,22
SCULLY:    Yeah.  I have.  We both have.  ,7,22
SCULLY:    It's a biological toxin emitted as a gas through the bloodstream.  ,7,22
SCULLY:    From what is arguably an alien.  ,7,22
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,7,22
"SCULLY:    Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.  ",7,22
SCULLY:    Mulder...  ,7,22
SCULLY:    I just...  I just...  I just hit the ground.  ,7,22
SCULLY:    Why is this happening to me?  ,7,22
"SCULLY:    What the hell's going on, Mulder?  ",7,22
SCULLY:    Warn him of what?  ,7,22
SCULLY:    Billy?  ,7,22
SCULLY:    Mulder?  ,7,22
"SCULLY:    Mulder, if any of this is true...  ",7,22
SCULLY:    (staring at him in disbelief)   Forget about it?  ,7,22
SCULLY:    What are you talking about?  ,7,22
SCULLY:    Mulder...  ,7,22
SCULLY:    I won't let you go alone.  ,7,22
SCULLY:    This just can't be.  ,7,22
"SCULLY:    Medical records-- Billy Miles and other known abductees in Bellefleur, Oregon.  They all experienced anomalous brain activity.  ",7,22
SCULLY:    Which is exactly what Mulder experienced earlier this year.  ,7,22
SCULLY:    There was something out there in that field.  It knocked me back.  Because it didn't want me.  Mulder thinks that it's me that's in danger of being taken.  ,7,22
SCULLY:    Scully?  ,7,22
SCULLY:    Hi.  ,7,22
SCULLY:    I'm feeling fine.  They're just running some tests on me.  ,7,22
SCULLY:    I already heard.  ,7,22
SCULLY:    (crying)   We will find him.  I have to.  ,7,22
"SCULLY:    Sir, um... there's something else I need to tell you.  Something that I need for you to keep to yourself.  ",7,22
"SCULLY:    I'm having a hard time explaining it. Or believing it.  But, um...  ",7,22
SCULLY:    I'm pregnant.  ,7,22
SCULLY:    I believe I was taken by men who subjected me to medical tests which left me barren.  ,8,1
SCULLY:    There was something out there in that field. It knocked me back because it didn't want me.  ,8,1
SCULLY:    (crying)   We will find him.  ,8,1
SCULLY:    I'm having a hard time believing it.  ,8,1
SCULLY:    I'm pregnant.  ,8,1
SCULLY:    What is this?!  Excuse me.  Can somebody please tell me what's going on here?  ,8,1
SCULLY:    For?  ,8,1
SCULLY:    What manhunt?  Manhunt for who?  ,8,1
"SCULLY:    Look, there's nothing.  If you're looking for Mulder, you're wasting your time.  Are you listening to me?  ",8,1
"SCULLY:    Well, then whose stupid idea is this?  ",8,1
SCULLY:    There are agents tearing apart Mulder's office who say they're part of an FBI manhunt.  ,8,1
SCULLY:    They're not going to find Mulder this way.  You know that and I know that.  ,8,1
"SCULLY:    Look, I don't understand.  You are the Assistant Director. Who is going over your head on this?  ",8,1
"SCULLY:    Our cooperation?  With due respect, there aren't two people better qualified to be directing this action, sir.  ",8,1
"SCULLY:    You make us out to be suspects, sir.  ",8,1
SCULLY:    I don't believe this.  ,8,1
SCULLY:    Why do I get the feeling they'd be happy if we never found him at all?  ,8,1
"SCULLY:    Well, you heard Kersh.  They don't want the truth. You give them the truth, and they'll hang you with it.  ",8,1
SCULLY:    What good are you to Mulder if you give them the power to ruin your career?  ,8,1
SCULLY:    We will find him.  ,8,1
SCULLY:    Thank you.  ,8,1
SCULLY:    (not expecting the question)   Yes.  ,8,1
SCULLY:    Why are they talking to you?  ,8,1
SCULLY:    I'd say they have all the character profile they need on him.  ,8,1
SCULLY:    I think I know Mulder as much as anybody.  ,8,1
SCULLY:    What rumors are those?  ,8,1
SCULLY:    Where'd that come from?  ,8,1
SCULLY:    No.  When was this?  ,8,1
SCULLY:   What's my theory?  My theory is you don't know Mulder at all. You never did.  ,8,1
"SCULLY:    ""John Doggett.""  Kersh's task force leader.  You might have just introduced yourself.  ",8,1
"SCULLY:    Nice to meet you, Agent Doggett.  ",8,1
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Mom, it's Dana.  I, uh... I'm sorry I haven't called you in a while.  I've been busy with work and, um, with something ... else that I should probably tell you about in person.  I mean, I don't even know if you're in town or if you're checking your messages. (her voice cracks, she is about to cry)   But, um...  but I really need to see you and talk to you.  There's a lot of stuff that's going on with me right now and, um... and I just really need to talk.  ",8,1
SCULLY:    Mom?  ,8,1
SCULLY:   (on phone)    You stay out of my business!  ,8,1
SCULLY:   (on phone)    You better have a court order!  ,8,1
SCULLY:   (on phone)    How many phones are you tapping? How many agents are you doing surveillance on?  ,8,1
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Thank you. You just answered all my questions.  ,8,1
SCULLY:    Stop there!  Right there!  Now come on through the window nice and easy.  ,8,1
"SCULLY:    I'm sorry, Mr. Coeben.  I'm sorry.  There was a man. There was someone in the building.  Did you see anyone?  ",8,1
SCULLY:    (almost speechless)   Who?  You... You don't mean Mulder?  ,8,1
SCULLY:    Mulder?  Are you in here?  ,8,1
SCULLY:    What are you doing here?  ,8,1
SCULLY:    I came by to feed Mulder's fish.  ,8,1
"SCULLY:    (angry)   You've got a way about you, Agent Doggett. That might have worked with the NYPD but you're talking to a fellow FBI agent now and I'd appreciate some respect.  ",8,1
SCULLY:    Who ambushed me with the phony chitchat about Mulder and then put a wiretap on my phone?  ,8,1
SCULLY:    And now you're following me.  ,8,1
"SCULLY:    What do you want to get on me, Agent Doggett? What is it you hope to find?  ",8,1
SCULLY:    You wouldn't know where to look.  ,8,1
SCULLY:    I don't even know the question.  ,8,1
"SCULLY:    You think by talking in circles, I'm just going to get dizzy and-and blurt it out-- this so-called answer?  ",8,1
SCULLY:    (defiantly)   You said it. I didn't.  ,8,1
SCULLY:    You want me to go on record?  I will go on record to say this; that I have seen things that I cannot explain.  I have observed phenomena that I cannot deny.  And that as a scientist and a serious person it is a badge of honor not to dismiss these things because someone thinks they're B.S.  ,8,1
SCULLY:    Then what are you doing here?  ,8,1
SCULLY:    I don't know.  ,8,1
SCULLY:    (to DOGGETT)   Skinner is telling the truth.  ,8,1
SCULLY:    You think it was Mulder?  ,8,1
SCULLY:    Two days ago?  By who? For what?  ,8,1
"SCULLY:    (realizing, with relief)   Mulder's mother is buried in Raleigh. That's the reason he was going every weekend.  ",8,1
SCULLY:    I don't know what to think.  ,8,1
SCULLY:    What is it?  ,8,1
SCULLY:    (reading the file)   His temporal lobe.  ,8,1
SCULLY:    (softly)   Mulder was dying.  ,8,1
"SCULLY:    It's all right here.  For a year, he was going to doctors. There's a clear record of his decline.  ",8,1
SCULLY:    How far would he go for what?  ,8,1
SCULLY:    It was his whole life.  ,8,1
SCULLY:    (hard to accept)   You think that Mulder was here? That he broke in to steal those files?  ,8,1
SCULLY:    Please don't report that.  ,8,1
SCULLY:    I think this is a waste of time.  ,8,1
"SCULLY:    I'm looking, and what I'm seeing is activity all over the southwestern states.  ",8,1
SCULLY:    Mulder disappeared in the Pacific Northwest.  ,8,1
SCULLY:    (disbelief)   Here?  In the Arizona desert?  ,8,1
SCULLY:    Okay. Say this is true ... then how do we even begin to start finding him?  ,8,1
SCULLY:    That's it.  It just came to me.  ,8,1
"SCULLY:    What you saw, why they took Mulder, why they're in Arizona now-- it all makes sense.  ",8,1
SCULLY:    Why do people refuse to believe in aliens and UFOs after all these years of sightings and eyewitness accounts?  Why?  ,8,1
"SCULLY:    Because, maybe, if there are aliens they're simply going around and they're... and they're removing all of the evidence before it becomes proof.  This isn't Mulder who's going around and collecting this stuff.  It's them.  ",8,1
"SCULLY:    Because they are looking to find that which is not in my computer or Mulder's computer or in the files that were removed from the FBI.  They are looking to find the whereabouts of good, hard proof. That in this case exists in a person, in a boy named Gibson Praise.  ",8,1
"SCULLY:    (gets herself together and looks at the map)   How to start looking for a 12-year-old kid in the middle of the Arizona desert.  Well, there aren't a whole lot of choices.  ",8,1
SCULLY:    Gibson Praise was last seen here at a power plant about 60 miles outside of Phoenix.  But all the satellite data shows activity here about 100 miles to the north.  ,8,1
"SCULLY:    Well, according to this map... a whole lot of nothing.  ",8,1
SCULLY:    Hi. Um ... we're looking for a boy named Gibson Praise.  ,8,1
SCULLY:    What are you doing here?  ,8,1
"SCULLY:    It just came to me... why they took Mulder, why they're in Arizona.  They're looking to find the whereabouts of a boy named Gibson Praise.  ",8,2
SCULLY:    What are you doing here?  ,8,2
"SCULLY:    (voiceover)   We live in a darkness of our own making... blind to a habitant world all but unseen by us.  A world of beings traveling through time and space imaginable to us only as flights of fancy.  Who are these beings we dare to imagine but fear to accept?  What dark work goes on inside their impossible machines... cloaked from us by invisible forces?  If they know our secrets, why can't we know theirs?  ",8,2
SCULLY:    Where is he?  Where's Mulder?  ,8,2
SCULLY:    You don't know?  I heard an agent say over the radio that you saw him.  ,8,2
SCULLY:    (confidently)  It wasn't Mulder.  ,8,2
"SCULLY:    It may have looked like Mulder, but it wasn't Mulder.  ",8,2
"SCULLY:    I'm sure it did look like Mulder, and you have every reason to believe that it was him...  but it was not Mulder. (she looks at SKINNER, then back to DOGGETT)   I told you that I've seen things... things that I can't explain.  Well, I have seen what looks like a man  transform into another man.  ",8,2
SCULLY:    You don't want to know.  ,8,2
SCULLY:    He's alien.  ,8,2
SCULLY:    He's a bounty hunter.  ,8,2
SCULLY:    On Gibson Praise... because he's part alien.  He's a human anomaly.  ,8,2
SCULLY:     (avoiding eye contact)   To take him back to his ship... where we believe Mulder is.  ,8,2
"SCULLY:    Well then, you explain it to me.  ",8,2
SCULLY:    I think that it is true.  And possible.  And wherever Mulder is right now... he better damn well be smiling.  ,8,2
SCULLY:    I don't know.  But he's going to turn this place upside down looking for the wrong person.  ,8,2
"SCULLY:    Well, whatever happened to him, he's long gone.  Wherever he is, he's three steps ahead of us.  ",8,2
"SCULLY:    I'm here to protect you, Gibson.  ",8,2
SCULLY:    I know you know that's the truth.  I know you know my thoughts.  ,8,2
"SCULLY:    (coming closer, gentle)  The only reason they want to take you, Gibson  is because you're a special boy.  They want to take you because of what you are.  ",8,2
SCULLY:    She has a right to be afraid.  We don't know who to trust now.  ,8,2
"SCULLY:    I think you might have broken it, Gibson.  ",8,2
"SCULLY:    I'm going to make you a splint, Gibson, okay?  I can set your leg, but, uh... I'm going to need a car to get you out of here.  (SCULLY rises and breaks off a couple of pieces of wood from a crate.)  I'm going to come back for you.  I promise.  I'm not going to let anything bad happen to you.  ",8,2
SCULLY:    (reacting to the three men staring at her)   What?  ,8,2
SCULLY:    From who?  From me?  Where?  ,8,2
SCULLY:    Tell him to hold her.  Tell them not to let her out of his sight!  ,8,2
SCULLY:    Hey!!  ,8,2
SCULLY:    There she is.  Do you see her?  ,8,2
SCULLY:    Where did she go?  Did you see her?  ,8,2
SCULLY:    She ran right back here.  I saw her.  ,8,2
SCULLY:    You saw her.  ,8,2
SCULLY:    Agent...  Can you breathe?  ,8,2
SCULLY:    He thinks it was me.  He thinks that I did this to him.  (to DOGGETT)  How is that possible?  ,8,2
SCULLY:    It's someone in this room.  ,8,2
SCULLY:    Who are you?  ,8,2
SCULLY:    Drop your weapon and turn around.  ,8,2
SCULLY:    Just do it!  I know how it works-- kill shot to the back of the neck.  ,8,2
"SCULLY:    Turn around, or I'm going to assume that you're not who you say you are.  ",8,2
SCULLY:    (still pointing the gun)   Okay...  then tell me.  ,8,2
SCULLY:    No.  That's what's wrong here.  It hasn't gone far enough.  I need those car keys.  ,8,2
"SCULLY:    (tearing up)   Look, we are being hampered here by the FBI, by John Doggett, by doubt, by our own mistrust.  Whatever it is, it is working... as long as we let it.  ",8,2
SCULLY:    I-I can't take the chance that I'm never going to see him again.  ,8,2
SCULLY:    Look... we've got one last chance here waiting for us out there in the desert-- Gibson Praise.  It may just be who gets to him first.  ,8,2
SCULLY:    Gibson!  ,8,2
SCULLY:    I told him to stay here.  He was supposed to stay here.  (yelling)   Gibson! (she sees something a few yards away)   I found him.  ,8,2
"SCULLY:    Gibson.  What are you doing out here?  Why didn't you answer me, huh?  ",8,2
SCULLY:    (glances up at SKINNER)   What are you talking about?  ,8,2
SCULLY:    He's got a really bad fever.  I think his leg might be infected.  ,8,2
SCULLY:    You take him to the hospital.  ,8,2
SCULLY:    Mulder!  ,8,2
SCULLY:    Mulder!  ,8,2
"SCULLY:    Oh, my god.  ",8,2
"SCULLY:    For someone who claims he's not following me, you sure have a knack.  ",8,2
SCULLY:    What does that tell you?  That I'm crazy or that I'm right?  ,8,2
SCULLY:    You say you want to find Mulder but you won't do what it takes.  You're afraid that I'm right.  ,8,2
SCULLY:    You've seen this crap for yourself now.  How do you explain what took place today?  ,8,2
SCULLY:    I know what Agent Mulder would do.  He'd do whatever it took.  ,8,2
"SCULLY:    Give a little, get a little, Agent Doggett.  ",8,2
SCULLY:    What kid?  I don't see any kid.  ,8,2
SCULLY:    How do you know that?  ,8,2
SCULLY:    Your men... followed Assistant Director Skinner?  ,8,2
SCULLY:    Your men are at the hospital?  ,8,2
SCULLY:    How do you know that they're your men?  ,8,2
SCULLY:    Where's the boy?  ,8,2
SCULLY:    Are you certain about that?  ,8,2
"SCULLY:    Yeah, every minute that you wait, that boy's in danger.  He's exposed.  ",8,2
"SCULLY:    You believe that, Agent Doggett?  ",8,2
"SCULLY:   (sarcastically, yet serious)    Hey, if something tries to rip your throat out, I got you covered.  ",8,2
SCULLY:    There's no one in that  room.  ,8,2
"SCULLY:    I'm looking for a patient, a boy, 12 years old.  He may still be in this building.  ",8,2
SCULLY:    How did you get here?  How did you get him out of that room?  ,8,2
SCULLY:    Where is he?  ,8,2
SCULLY:    That supposed to cheer me up?  ,8,2
SCULLY:    And you never will.  You still don't believe me.  ,8,2
"SCULLY:    Oh, it's just some things they have to check out... make sure of.  ",8,2
"SCULLY:    What are you doing here, Agent Doggett?  ",8,2
SCULLY:    That's not your job.  ,8,2
SCULLY:    I suggest you postpone the transfer.  We can get him out later once the crowd disperses.  ,8,3
SCULLY:    (sound distorted)   Somebody call a medic!  ,8,3
"SCULLY:    Do you recognize this, Mr. Wells?  Have you seen it before?  ",8,3
"SCULLY:    This key card, Mr. Wells...  you do recognize it.  Is that correct?  ",8,3
SCULLY:    It is yours.  It was found in the dumpster behind the Strand Hotel.  ,8,3
"SCULLY:    Mr. Wells, we understand that you had an interesting morning in court. What is it that you'd like to speak with us about?  ",8,3
SCULLY:    Are you saying that you don't remember?  What is the last thing that you do remember?  ,8,3
SCULLY:    Yes... You do.  ,8,3
"SCULLY:    Mr. Wells, this shooting aside is there anything else that you remember before that?  ",8,3
"SCULLY:    That was three days ago, Mr. Wells.  Are you telling us that you don't remember anything else?  Not the murder of your wife?  ",8,3
SCULLY:    If you truly don't remember...  then how can you be certain that you didn't?  ,8,3
SCULLY:    It's nice to meet you.  I'm sorry it's not under better circumstances.  ,8,3
"SCULLY:    Mr. Wells, are you saying that you don't remember the day that your wife was murdered?  I'm talking about two days ago, Monday.  ",8,3
"SCULLY:    You do realize that you're not going to be able to prove this, right?  I mean, if, uh... if tomorrow is really the day before today, then we won't have had this conversation.  ",8,3
SCULLY:    It means you're going to have to tell us all over again.  ,8,3
"SCULLY:    Mr. Wells, let's say that, that all this is true.  Why do you think it's happening?  ",8,3
SCULLY:    What reason?  ,8,3
SCULLY:    Maybe you already have the answer within you.  ,8,3
SCULLY:   Good morning.  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    I'm not here to be a curiosity, Agent Doggett.   I'm here to work.  ",8,4
SCULLY:    Well... do you have any questions?  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    This is my partner's office, Agent Doggett. You and I will just be using it for a while.  ",8,4
"SCULLY:    Homicides: Two  in Idaho. White male, 62, undertaker by profession, he was killed on his front porch about ten feet away from his wife.  ",8,4
"SCULLY:    Cause of death was blood loss from numerous deep wounds  from bites. Any thoughts, any questions?  ",8,4
SCULLY:    On his head torso and hands. Two of his fingers are missing... eaten off.  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    These were murders. The, uh, bites on his wife appear to be human.  ",8,4
SCULLY:    Not according to local P.D.  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    Well, that's a good place to start.  ",8,4
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,8,4
SCULLY:    Hi. Agent Scully. This is Agent Doggett.  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    Understand, Detective, that we've seen cases like yours regularly on our unit.  Agent Doggett has only just been assigned to the X-Files.  ",8,4
SCULLY:    I can assure you that there's nothing baffling about human bite marks.  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    It's not quite animal, either.  ",8,4
"SCULLY:    That's not an unheard of birth defect. Uh, no more rare than polydactylism.  ",8,4
SCULLY:    I say that assumption is the problem here. A strange print is found and immediately the most important piece of evidence is just thrown out to try and force an explanation.  Maybe this print can help explain those bite marks.  ,8,4
SCULLY:    I'm not quite sure yet.  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    (quietly frustrated)   I think that post-mortem predation is definitely a consideration here, but I only see one print and if it were an animal there would be numerous prints all over here and in the yard.  ",8,4
"SCULLY:    You agree, Agent Doggett?  ",8,4
"SCULLY:    I'm sure your explanation will mollify all those hotshots down at the county seat, Detective and relieve any general anxiety about what this thing might be   but only until it strikes again. And one more thing: I never said that what you're looking for is a man.  ",8,4
SCULLY:    It could be but I'm not sure if it tells us anything.  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    Well, if anything, I'd say this print leads up the stairs.  ",8,4
SCULLY:    Mm-hmm.  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    Yeah. You take every possible explanation and you choose the simplest one. Agent Mulder used to refer to it as ""Occam's Principle of Limited Imagination.""  ",8,4
SCULLY:    Unless you have a simple explanation as to how a killer with a deformed foot leaves a print only every 25 feet.  ,8,4
SCULLY:    Or to what he'd even be doing up here.  ,8,4
SCULLY:    (softly)   Agent Doggett.  ,8,4
SCULLY:    Dark up here.  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    Right now, not a heck of a lot.  ",8,4
SCULLY:    If there was anything up here it might have gone out that window.  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    (pause, dryly)   Never.  ",8,4
SCULLY:    What?  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    Well, from their smell, I'd say they were regurgitated.  Recently.  ",8,4
"SCULLY:    I saw those on the porch, too.  ",8,4
SCULLY:    Hanging there?  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    Yeah. Well, I was waiting for some lab results and then I wanted to take another look at the body.  ",8,4
SCULLY:    Nothing that will allay anyone's fears about what killed this man or his wife.  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    Well, to be honest, what I found here leans more towards an animal explanation. The, uh, scratches on the body match the four-toed prints that we found. And the bites have fang-like tears. What I thought were marks left by human molars are now inconclusive because of enzymes that were found in the bites which are clearly inhuman- - anticoagulants which  are found solely in the saliva of bats.  ",8,4
SCULLY:    Yeah.   I can't exactly explain it but I realize that I owe the Detective an apology.  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    (reading)    ""The creature was taken to the county coroner who confirmed it was neither man nor animal.""  ",8,4
SCULLY:    Did they ever find it?  ,8,4
SCULLY:    Agent Doggett...  ,8,4
SCULLY:    I found something. A photo album.   I think it's our first break on this case.  ,8,4
SCULLY:    The victim's daughter-- Ariel-- her dead body was pulled from the river here last week.  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    Well, you not only told her mother that her 62-year-old daughter was dead but that her body had been horribly and inexplicably burned. A daughter who, by the way, she hadn't even seen in over 40 years.  Since 1956, to be exact-- which is the date your article says those first killings started.  ",8,4
SCULLY:    The daughter is the connection.  ,8,4
SCULLY:    I don't know exactly but these killings only started up since her burned body has been found.  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    Well, I suggest that you jump at it, too because her body may have been burned for a reason and you're going to want to exhume it in order to find out why.  ",8,4
SCULLY:    What did you say to him?  ,8,4
SCULLY:    What else did you say to him?  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    Look, I am not an expert. I am a scientist who happens to have seen a lot.  I am just making a leap here.  ",8,4
"SCULLY:    Look, so, so, what, you told him to exhume the body when you don't even necessarily believe me yourself?  ",8,4
"SCULLY:    Well, I'd say that you're taking a pretty big leap believing in that article... about a human bat.  ",8,4
SCULLY:    What happened to the lynch mob?  ,8,4
SCULLY:    I heard enough.  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    I don't think so, Agent Doggett.  ",8,4
SCULLY:    It was unavoidable.  ,8,4
SCULLY:    This is the body pulled from the river. She died of natural causes-- congestive heart failure-- but her body was only burned afterwards.  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    Well, obviously to cover something up.  ",8,4
SCULLY:    That's what I still don't know.  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    Look, it kills like an animal, but with purpose. It stalked the detective for the same reason that it stalked the old woman and the undertaker. Each of those victims had had contact with this burnt body. The undertaker prepared it.  Her mother ID'd it and the Detective got the call when she was found.  ",8,4
"SCULLY:    The, uh, man who found her in the river. (looks at the file)   A, uh, Myron Stefaniuk.  ",8,4
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,8,4
SCULLY:    There's an address in his file. I hope we're not too late.  ,8,4
SCULLY:    Myron Stefaniuk?  ,8,4
SCULLY:    (relieved sigh)   Good.  Sorry. You gave us a bit of a scare. We went to your home up the road and we couldn't find you.  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    Well, we're investigating some murders, sir, that we believe may be connected to the burnt body that you found recently.  ",8,4
SCULLY:    It may just be your connection to the body.  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    Well, sorry, sir, but that may be enough.  ",8,4
"SCULLY:    You know, we've been out here for nine hours. The only thing this man seems to be in danger of is terminal loneliness.  ",8,4
SCULLY:    (depressed)   Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe this is all just a... a grand coincidence and we're wasting our time out here.  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    Yeah, I was sure of the facts as I had deduced them scientifically. Maybe I'm... I'm trying to force them into shape. Maybe I'm manufacturing a theory.  ",8,4
SCULLY:    Maybe I'm just trying too hard.  ,8,4
SCULLY:    What makes you say that?  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    Well, what does he have to hide?  ",8,4
SCULLY:    Stop right there!  ,8,4
SCULLY:    I see him.  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    Stop where you are!  Put your hands up and out! Now, turn around, slowly.  ",8,4
"SCULLY:    Even if that were true, sir, how could it possibly find you out here on an island?  ",8,4
SCULLY:    Mr. Stefaniuk... it's killed four people. All of whom would have had traces of your scent through various degrees of contact with your wife's body.  ,8,4
SCULLY:    He's all right. We spoke with him earlier today.  ,8,4
SCULLY:    What's that?  ,8,4
SCULLY:    We followed your brother.  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    I was sure that what we were looking for was something other than a man. Uh, the detective who was running the case didn't believe that, and...uh,  he's dead.  ",8,4
SCULLY:    I think he does now.  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    Well, I  I made the connections but it was Agent Doggett that got us out here.  ",8,4
SCULLY:    Excuse me?  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    Sir, I'm here to protect you.  ",8,4
"SCULLY:    Well, this thing, Mr. Stefaniuk is  uh  still flesh and blood. It can be killed.  ",8,4
SCULLY:    What is that?  ,8,4
SCULLY:    You hear it?  ,8,4
SCULLY:    Maybe I got it. Maybe I killed it.  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    If you've got a gun, get it.  ",8,4
"SCULLY:    Yeah. I'm okay. But you're not, Agent Doggett. I got you.  ",8,4
SCULLY:    He's alive? Where is he?  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    Do you believe it, Agent Doggett?  ",8,4
SCULLY:    That this thing is still out there and someday it's going to come after us?  ,8,4
SCULLY:    Yeah. You'll get used to it.  ,8,4
"SCULLY:    I, uh... I never had a desk in here, Agent Doggett but I'll see that you get one.  ",8,4
"SCULLY:    And I just want to say, um... thank you for watching my back.  ",8,4
SCULLY:    Damn.  ,8,5
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Hey, it's Scully.  Good morning.  ",8,5
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Well, actually, I'm out of town.  I'm  north of Sugarville, Utah, roughly.  ",8,5
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    The, uh, local coroner wants a consultation on a murder victim....  a man who was found beaten to death in the desert.  Apparently, his corpse shows some anomalous characteristics.  ",8,5
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    From what they're telling me, he is a, uh, 22-year-old backpacker who was last seen by his family about six months ago in perfect health.  However, his body is now showing advanced signs of osteoporosis, arthritis, and kyphosis of the vertebrae. In other words, he's got a spine of a 90-year-old woman.  ",8,5
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Well, it was just a, uh, a simple consultation... and, uh... he called me over the weekend and I figured I wasn't going to bother you.  ",8,5
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Well, actually, there might be, if you don't mind. Somewhere in our files... there is a, uh, an unsolved murder case.  ",8,5
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Unfortunately, I , uh, don't remember any of the particulars like where or when it took place but I do remember that there were some glycoproteins found at the crime scene.  ",8,5
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Yeah, mucous... But it was, uh, unable to be identified, and seeing as how you, uh, recently read through all of our files I thought maybe it would ring a bell with you.  ",8,5
SCULLY:   (on phone)    I'm sorry?  ,8,5
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    No, no, no, just, uh, just mucous.  Look, when you find that file, will you fax it over to the Juab County Sheriff's office?  That's the best place to reach me.  My cell phone doesn't seem to be working out here.  ",8,5
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Thank you.  ,8,5
SCULLY:    Hello?  ,8,5
"SCULLY:    Good  thanks.  I, uh, I was wondering.  A bus came through here a little while ago.  Uh, do you happen to know where it might have gone?  ",8,5
SCULLY:    Do you know what's up that road?  ,8,5
"SCULLY:    Uh, can I ask what happened to your hand?  ",8,5
"SCULLY:    Yeah.  There was a, uh, murder out here last week about 15, 20 miles off the state road.  Did you, uh, did you hear about it?  ",8,5
"SCULLY:    Yeah.  Well, you're going to want to wash this out. Put some iodine on it.  You don't want it to get infected.  ",8,5
"SCULLY:    Yeah, well, I also sound like a doctor.  ",8,5
SCULLY:    Yeah.  Can you sell me some gas?  ,8,5
"SCULLY:    I got a... quarter tank, I think.  I'll make it.  It's all right.  ",8,5
SCULLY:    Thanks.  ,8,5
"SCULLY:    Oh, that's great.  Thank you.  ",8,5
"SCULLY:    Where is ""here,"" exactly?  'Cause I can't seem to find this town on the map.  ",8,5
SCULLY:    Thank you very much.  ,8,5
SCULLY:    Okay.  ,8,5
SCULLY:    Hey.  Excuse me.  You put something in my tank that killed my engine.  ,8,5
"SCULLY:    Where's that gas can?  I'd like to see it, please.  ",8,5
SCULLY:    That's water.  I barely even smell any gasoline.  ,8,5
"SCULLY:    Oh, and it rains a lot here, does it?  Seeing as how it's basically the desert.  ",8,5
SCULLY:    Yeah. I'm going to use your phone.  ,8,5
SCULLY:   You don't have a phone.  So how did you call up the tanker that was supposed to come here yesterday?  ,8,5
SCULLY:   Hello?  Hello?  ,8,5
SCULLY:    Hi.  ,8,5
SCULLY:    Mr. Milsap?  ,8,5
"SCULLY:    Yes, I hope so.  My, uh, car has stalled up the street and I was wondering if I could use your phone.  ",8,5
SCULLY:   The line's dead.  ,8,5
SCULLY:    How long?  ,8,5
SCULLY:    I won't be here that long.  ,8,5
SCULLY:    What the hell is going on here?  ,8,5
SCULLY:    I get the distinct impression that somebody doesn't want me to leave.  ,8,5
SCULLY:    A bus came through here about an hour ago.  Where did it go?  ,8,5
SCULLY:    Don't tell me you didn't see it.  ,8,5
"SCULLY:    Excuse me.  Ma'am, excuse me.  Ma'am.  Excuse me, ma'am.  ",8,5
"SCULLY:    Hello?  Ma'am, I need some help.  ",8,5
SCULLY:    Hello?  ,8,5
SCULLY:    Hello?  ,8,5
SCULLY:    Let go.  Don't hold him down.  ,8,5
SCULLY:    How long has he been seizing?  ,8,5
SCULLY:    It's okay. You're all right.  You're okay.  ,8,5
SCULLY:    What's his name?  ,8,5
"SCULLY:    He had a grand mal seizure.  As far as I can tell, he's in status.  It's a continuous seizure state.  He doesn't smell like acetone, which would indicate that he's hyperglycemic and  uh  he doesn't appear to have any head injuries.  He could be epileptic and just ceased taking his medication.  ",8,5
SCULLY:    How did this happen?  ,8,5
"SCULLY:    Uh-huh.  At any rate, we need to get him to a hospital. Immediately.  ",8,5
SCULLY:    I assume that your phone's still not working.  ,8,5
"SCULLY:    Well, do you or one of your ""friendly"" neighbors happen to have a car?  ",8,5
SCULLY:    No cars?  ,8,5
"SCULLY:    All right, do you... um  do you have any Karo syrup? Any corn syrup?  ",8,5
"SCULLY:    Yeah, you can hold off now.  ",8,5
"SCULLY:    I'm sorry, but, uh... I'm just winging it here.  I mean, raising his blood sugar only helps if his condition is brought on by hypoglycemia, but this could be the result of any number of things.  ",8,5
"SCULLY:    Well, I'm afraid that I have done all that I can do  unless you know how to get ahold of diazepam or phenobarbital other than the nearest hospital  which is where we should be, of course.  ",8,5
"SCULLY:    Hey, hey.  Can you hear me?  How are you feeling?  ",8,5
SCULLY:    Yes.  I am.  ,8,5
"SCULLY:    Well, I'm not sure if I've actually done anything.  In fact, I don't even know, uh, I don't even know what's going on with you right now.  Do you know what your name is?  ",8,5
SCULLY:    You don't remember do you?  How about how you got here?  ,8,5
SCULLY:    What about these people who have taken you in? Do you know anything about them?  ,8,5
"SCULLY:    Yeah, I'll say they take very good care of you.  The sun seems to rise and set on you as far as they're concerned.  In fact, they seem to have stranded me here in order to nurse you back to health.  ",8,5
"SCULLY:    A murder took place about 20 miles from here.  A man was stoned to death.  His head was so badly crushed, that they couldn't identify him from his teeth.  Now it looks like upwards of a dozen people may have participated due to the footprints at the crime scene, but it's a very tight knit group of people who would murder together. A cult, in a word.  And I'd say that these people qualify.  ",8,5
"SCULLY:    FBI.  And I need to get you out of here, but I don't know how. Okay, do you think that you can you walk?  ",8,5
SCULLY:   I understand.  ,8,5
"SCULLY:    Hang  hang on a second.  Just let me look at something, okay?  ",8,5
SCULLY:    All right.  ,8,5
"SCULLY:    Hold on,  hold on.  ",8,5
SCULLY:    He's coming to.  Hey.   Can you hear me?  How are you feeling?  ,8,5
SCULLY:    It's lucky they're still listening to you for the time being.  ,8,5
"SCULLY:    This... wound in your back... it seems to be a point of entry for a parasitic organism that has taken up residence along your spine.  Now, this is something that I am completely unfamiliar with.  ",8,5
SCULLY:    I don't know how far this extends or how to get it out of you without harming you.  ,8,5
"SCULLY:    You will die if we cannot treat you properly.  Now, these people don't seem to want to let you go.  I think that they put this thing inside of you.  ",8,5
"SCULLY:    Now, I have no idea what the motives of these people are-- whether it's some bizarre religious activity-- but they killed the last person who was in your condition and I'm afraid that they're going to try and kill you, too.  ",8,5
SCULLY:    No kidding.  ,8,5
SCULLY:    I'm going to try and get us the hell out of here.  ,8,5
"SCULLY:    These, uh... people tell me that they have no cars.  I don't believe them.  They've got to have transportation hidden around here somewhere.  ",8,5
"SCULLY:    I'm going to go take a look around, okay?  ",8,5
SCULLY:    You know how to use a gun?  ,8,5
SCULLY:    I'll be back soon.  ,8,5
SCULLY:    Hey.  How'd you...?  ,8,5
SCULLY:    You had me convinced.  ,8,5
"SCULLY:    (yelling)    I'm a Federal Agent!  At this moment, the FBI is searching for me!  ",8,5
SCULLY:    No!  Ahhh!!!  You son of a bitch!  ,8,5
SCULLY:    You just murdered him!  ,8,5
"SCULLY:    No.  No!  I'm pregnant!  No!  No, don't do this! I'm going to have a baby!  ",8,5
SCULLY:    No!  Don't do this!  No!  I'm going to have a baby!  ,8,5
SCULLY:    No!  No!  No!  No!  ,8,5
SCULLY:    What did you put in me?!  I'm going to get every last one of you bastards!  ,8,5
"SCULLY:    Him?!  That thing in my spine is a ""him""?!  ",8,5
SCULLY:    Help!  Help!  Help!  ,8,5
SCULLY:    Help!  Help!  ,8,5
SCULLY:    Help!  Help!  ,8,5
SCULLY:    Agent Doggett.   Get me the hell out of here.  ,8,5
SCULLY:    I don't know.   How far is your car?  ,8,5
SCULLY:    I know something closer.  ,8,5
SCULLY:    Can you hot-wire it?  ,8,5
SCULLY:    You got to cut it out.  Cut it out. Oh... Oh...  Now it's going to come to my brain.  ,8,5
SCULLY:    (screaming)   Cut it out of me now!  ,8,5
"SCULLY:    Aah!  Just do it, Doggett!  ",8,5
"SCULLY:    Yeah, I'm ready to go.  ",8,5
SCULLY:    They believe they worshipped Christ.  That that thing was the Second Coming.  ,8,5
"SCULLY:    Look, I, uh... I wanted to apologize.  I  I left you out of this case, and that was a mistake on my part.  It was almost a fatal mistake.  ",8,5
SCULLY:    And I won't do it again.  ,8,5
"SCULLY:    I'm just going to shine this light in your eyes, okay?  You're doing great. See?  Nothing to it.  ",8,6
"SCULLY:    (speaking quietly to DOGGETT)   Okay.  Well, what we've got here is a healthy seven-year-old boy who was born 17 years ago.  ",8,6
SCULLY:    Mr. and Mrs. Underwood?  ,8,6
"SCULLY:    Yes. I'm Agent Scully, and this is Agent Doggett.  We are, uh, investigating this case.  ",8,6
"SCULLY:    Mrs. Underwood... whatever your son has been through, it has somehow affected his physical condition.  ",8,6
SCULLY:    Uh...  ,8,6
SCULLY:    Mr. Underwood...?  ,8,6
SCULLY:    You think this is a game?  ,8,6
"SCULLY:    Have you really worked kid cases before, Agent Doggett?  Child abductions?  ",8,6
SCULLY:    This isn't just a horror story.  This is a biological impossibility.  ,8,6
SCULLY:    You are ignoring the fact that he is still seven years old.  ,8,6
SCULLY:    I told you...  he's not sick.  ,8,6
"SCULLY:    You going to sleep here, too?  ",8,6
SCULLY:    I spoke with the doctors who treated Billy.  I looked at his charts.  ,8,6
SCULLY:    Yes and no.  What showed up is that Billy is the same boy who was taken ten years ago.  ,8,6
"SCULLY:    No.  I mean the same-  boy.  He has no cavities. He has no tooth decay.  He still has four baby teeth that he's never lost.  He had a routine blood test six weeks before he disappeared in 1990.  His cell counts, his enzymes, his hormone levels, they are all exactly the same as they were ten years ago.  ",8,6
SCULLY:    It's medically impossible.  ,8,6
SCULLY:    There are  X-File cases that describe similar paranormal findings.  Alien abductees who came back with anomalous medical stats.  ,8,6
"SCULLY:    I'm not saying that I can explain it, Agent Doggett, but this is definitely not normal.  ",8,6
SCULLY:    What's your interest in this guy?  ,8,6
"SCULLY:    These are juvenile records.  These are sealed by the court, Agent Doggett. We're not supposed to have these.  ",8,6
"SCULLY:    (angry)   Yeah, and you're breaking the law.  ",8,6
SCULLY:    No. Billy wasn't cut either.  ,8,6
"SCULLY:    Well, I hate to say this  but I think that the best thing for Billy and his family is if he's removed to an institution under the observation of people who are experienced in these things.  ",8,6
"SCULLY:    This is not a normal child, Agent Doggett, and this is not a normal act.  ",8,6
SCULLY:    And what's the message?  ,8,6
"SCULLY:    Yes, he's a kid, Agent Doggett, you're right.  He's a kid who materialized out of thin air, unaged.  Do you not somehow recognize how strange this is?  ",8,6
"SCULLY:    I've seen this symbol before, too.  ",8,6
"SCULLY:    I understand your misgivings, Mr. Underwood, but perhaps you can look at this as just another avenue.  ",8,6
SCULLY:    Ms. Pearl?  Are you okay?  ,8,6
SCULLY:    She's having a grand mal seizure.]  ,8,6
"SCULLY:    Oh, my god.  ",8,6
"SCULLY:    Well, they've got her stabilized and it looks like she's going to be okay... if you're at all curious about her condition.  ",8,6
SCULLY:    Believed what?  ,8,6
SCULLY:    You think that was an act?  ,8,6
SCULLY:    You saw that symbol appear on her forehead.  ,8,6
SCULLY:    No.  I think you want to hear this.  ,8,6
SCULLY:    Now listen to it backwards.  ,8,6
SCULLY:    It's a child singing.  ,8,6
SCULLY:    Lyrics.  ,8,6
"SCULLY:    You hear that, under the noise?   Now...  ",8,6
SCULLY:    Get out of the car!  Now!  ,8,6
SCULLY:    I thought you said Billy was in the car?  ,8,6
"SCULLY:    Count to ten, Agent Doggett.  ",8,6
SCULLY:    (sighs)   He couldn't have.  ,8,6
"SCULLY:    By the certain knowledge that not five minutes earlier, I saw him enter his home with his mother.  ",8,6
"SCULLY:    It's impossible, Agent Doggett, like everything else about this case.  Like how Billy can be in his home one minute and then in Ronnie's car the next.  Everything about this case is impossible.  ",8,6
SCULLY:    Agent Doggett...  He's on the run.  ,8,6
"SCULLY:    Okay, the clothes, the age and condition of the bones, the location of the grave.  There is no doubt that that is Billy Underwood's skeleton that is in that grave.  ",8,6
"SCULLY:    I know, but the forensic evidence is going to come out, and what then? What if I'm right?  ",8,6
"SCULLY:    Look, I know where you are with this.  I have been there.  I know what you're feeling-- that you've failed and that you have to explain this somehow.  And maybe you can.  ",8,6
"SCULLY:    But maybe that's explanation enough.  That that's not Billy's brother lying in that grave, too.  That that man who did this is never going to be able to do it again.  Isn't that what you wanted, Agent Doggett?  ",8,6
SCULLY:    All I'm saying is that maybe you succeeded... whether you're willing to see that or not.  ,8,6
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    It's, uh, it's Agent Scully.  I'm sorry to wake you.  ",8,7
SCULLY:   (on phone)    I got a call about 20 minutes ago from Assistant Director Skinner.  He has a situation.  ,8,7
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    An Agent is dead.  Um, Skinner had him surveilling a religious cult in Pittsburgh.  And all the followers are dead, as well.  ",8,7
SCULLY:   (on phone)    He's having difficulty determining that.  ,8,7
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    I'm sorry, Agent Doggett.  I can't go.  ",8,7
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Um, something unexpected has come up.  ",8,7
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Yeah, I'm, I'm fine.  ",8,7
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Uh, as soon as I can.  ",8,7
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Skinner told me about the case.  I know that you covered for me.  You didn't have to do that.  ,8,7
SCULLY:   (on phone)    I appreciate your discretion.  ,8,7
SCULLY:   (on phone)    I'm fine.  Skinner says that you're on the clock on this thing.  You need to get your rest.  ,8,7
SCULLY:   (on phone)    I asked him to contact some friends of Mulder's. I think they'll be able to help.  ,8,7
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Doggett, you're a good agent.  Trust your instincts.  ",8,7
SCULLY'S ANSWERING MACHINE:   This is Dana Scully.  Please leave a message. (beep)  ,8,7
SCULLY'S VOICE:    Agent Doggett?  ,8,7
SCULLY:    Agent Doggett.   Hi.  ,8,7
SCULLY:    Your door was unlocked.  ,8,7
"SCULLY:    I just woke you up, Agent Doggett.  ",8,7
SCULLY:    Anthony Tipet is dead.  I got the call from Skinner on my way over here.  He never regained consciousness.  ,8,7
"SCULLY:    I seem to be, yes.  ",8,7
"SCULLY:    No. I'm, um... I'm back at work now.  That must have been some nightmare you just had.  ",8,7
SCULLY:    You don't think he succeeded?  ,8,7
SCULLY:    Then where'd they come from?  ,8,7
"SCULLY:    It was a bad dream, Agent Doggett, but that's all it was.  ",8,7
SCULLY:    I was taken by men who subjected me to medical tests which left me barren.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    I'm having a hard time explaining it.  I'm pregnant.   ,8,8
SCULLY:    Hi.  ,8,8
"SCULLY:    I'm sorry, Agent Doggett, I didn't realize that you had an appointment.  ",8,8
SCULLY:    I'm sorry.  I don't remember.  ,8,8
"SCULLY:    That was before my time here.  But, uh, is there something I can help you with?  ",8,8
SCULLY:    I-I thought you said that your wife was murdered.  ,8,8
"SCULLY:    Ooo-kay, Mr. Haskell.  Why don't you, uh, start from the beginning.  ",8,8
"SCULLY:    I don't suppose that you have any, uh, medical proof of this.  ",8,8
SCULLY:    What doctors?  ,8,8
SCULLY:    So you're... saying that it was the doctors that killed your wife?  ,8,8
"SCULLY:    Do you, uh... have all the information and numbers and a way that we can reach Mr. Haskell?  ",8,8
"SCULLY:    Uh, we'll be in touch.  ",8,8
"SCULLY:    Thank you, Agent Doggett.  I'm sure the rest of my afternoon can't possibly be so amusing.  ",8,8
SCULLY:    Interesting?  As in preposterous and outrageous?  ,8,8
SCULLY:    What exactly are you getting at?  ,8,8
"SCULLY:    Well, I appreciate your thoroughness, Agent Doggett, and your familiarity with the X-Files cases in those cabinets, but my personal files are my personal files. Okay?  ",8,8
"SCULLY:    Hi.  Um, I'm sorry.  I had a doctor's appointment and, um, I don't know, I guess time just got away from me.  ",8,8
"SCULLY:    Nothing.  No, I just, uh...  I went for a walk.  ",8,8
"SCULLY:    I'm... I'm sorry I haven't told you.  I don't know why I haven't.  I mean, you were always there for me during my illness but, um...  ",8,8
SCULLY:    I was left unable to conceive with whatever test that they did on me.  And I am not ready to accept that I will never have children.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    What?  ,8,8
SCULLY:    What?  ,8,8
SCULLY:    You found them?  ,8,8
SCULLY:    I don't believe this.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    Is that what it was?  It was bad news?  ,8,8
SCULLY:    I want a second opinion.  ,8,8
"SCULLY:    Um, I don't know.  I guess I just forgot to push the button.  ",8,8
SCULLY:    There's nothing to do.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    Hello.  Is anybody here?  ,8,8
"SCULLY:    I'm, um, I'm here with my friend.  ",8,8
SCULLY:    Yes.  I'm worried about her.  ,8,8
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Yes, I want to speak to Dr. Parenti, please.  ",8,8
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Yes, it is.  It's Dana Scully.  ",8,8
SCULLY:   (on phone)    I'm afraid.  ,8,8
SCULLY:   (on phone)    I want you to look at something for me.  Right away.  It's an ultrasound.  ,8,8
SCULLY:   (on phone)    I want you to compare it to mine.  ,8,8
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Yes.  Fine, I'm... I'm okay.  ",8,8
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Thank you.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    Oh...  It's too good to be true.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    We can start right away?  ,8,8
"SCULLY:    Yeah... I, uh... I just have to figure out how to ask him.  ",8,8
SCULLY:    What did you find?  ,8,8
SCULLY:    You didn't see anything strange?  ,8,8
SCULLY:    I just want to be sure.  I've had... complications.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    Okay.  Thank you.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    Right.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    Dr. Parenti is my doctor.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    You don't believe me?  ,8,8
"SCULLY:    Excuse me, Agent Doggett, but are you investigating me?  ",8,8
"SCULLY:    No, I didn't ask you to drop the case.  I said there was nothing to do.  ",8,8
SCULLY:    You are jumping to conclusions.  ,8,8
"SCULLY:    I am not investigating these people, Agent Doggett.  Parenti is my doctor.  Is that so strange?  Is there something about him I don't know?  ",8,8
SCULLY:    Hi.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    Come on in.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    Can I take your coat?  ,8,8
SCULLY:    Obviously you've had some time to think about my request.  ,8,8
"SCULLY:    Okay, if... if you're trying to politely say ""no,"" it's okay.  I, I understand.  ",8,8
"SCULLY:    Yeah.  I know... I, I understand.  I do.  ",8,8
"SCULLY:    Um... Well, I'll call Dr. Parenti and...  ",8,8
"SCULLY:    I assume that he'll want to meet you and go through the, uh, the donor procedure.  ",8,8
SCULLY:    Yes.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    No.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    I can't.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    Agent Doggett?  ,8,8
SCULLY:    I want you to understand.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    I told you... I'm not doing anything behind your back.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    If I was putting you at risk in any way you can be sure that I wouldn't let you down.  I hope you know that.  I only know what you tell me.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    I gotta go.  ,8,8
"SCULLY:    Yes, Dana Scully.  This is Ms. Hendershot.  Mary Hendershot.  ",8,8
"SCULLY:    Ms. Hendershot believes that she is carrying a baby that is not her own. That, by whatever means, at 40 weeks she is about to give birth to something inhuman.  ",8,8
"SCULLY:    She believes, and with possible good reason, that her life may be in danger. That women just like her have been murdered in childbirth.  ",8,8
SCULLY:    You should know that I'm not just here as an FBI agent.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    That's why we've come to you.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    A man named Haskell led her to me.  His pregnant wife is now dead.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    Dr. Miryum...  she's not the only woman whose life is in danger.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    Probably somewhere between four and 12 hours.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    You mean getting pregnant?  ,8,8
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    Are you sure?  ,8,8
SCULLY:    I just want to be certain that it's okay.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    Yeah. I just want to know.  I'm anxious about the results.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    Ms. Hendershot...  you have to get up.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    I have to get you out of here.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    Can you do this?  ,8,8
SCULLY:    Who are you?  ,8,8
SCULLY:    This woman could give birth at any minute. I hope you realize that.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    Where are you taking us?  ,8,8
SCULLY:    Oh.  ,8,8
"SCULLY:    Yeah, I just... just had a procedure.  I shouldn't even be on my feet.  ",8,8
SCULLY:    Mrs. Hendershot?  ,8,8
SCULLY:    We have to stop this car.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    If you don't stop this car you could be endangering her life.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    What are you doing?  ,8,8
SCULLY:    I'm fine.  Let go of me.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    Who are you?  ,8,8
SCULLY:    Ms. Hendershot...  ,8,8
SCULLY:    Mary!  ,8,8
SCULLY:    No!  ,8,8
SCULLY:    Hey!  ,8,8
SCULLY:    Agent Doggett?  ,8,8
SCULLY:    What are you doing here?  What am I doing back in this place?  ,8,8
SCULLY:    What happened to me?  ,8,8
SCULLY:    What about Ms. Hendershot?  ,8,8
SCULLY:    What about her baby?  ,8,8
"SCULLY:    Oh, my god.  They switched it.  Agent Doggett, they switched it on her.  ",8,8
"SCULLY:    No, it's not.  We can prove this.  ",8,8
SCULLY:    They showed me a tape of another woman's womb.  ,8,8
"SCULLY:    Well, then who were those men?  ",8,8
"SCULLY:    It was all planned.  You know that.  From the moment that man walked into our office. we were used to get at Ms. Hendershot's baby.  And now we are being used to cover it up.  Oh, my God.  ",8,8
SCULLY:    I was afraid.  Afraid that they'd use it against me to take me off the X-Files so that I couldn't find Mulder.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    I guess it was too much to hope for.  ,8,8
SCULLY:    It was my last chance.  ,8,8
"SCULLY: They've identified it as 9mm pistol ammunition, teflon-coated armour-piercing. Single round. He was shot, there's no doubt about that.  ",8,9
"SCULLY: Yeah. Well, what do we know about the victim?  ",8,9
SCULLY: He was right.  ,8,9
SCULLY: Looks to have entered through the top of his head.  ,8,9
SCULLY: Hi.  ,8,9
SCULLY: What's directly above this?  ,8,9
SCULLY: He didn't make it from here. Can I use your pencil?  ,8,9
SCULLY: Captain! (Holding up the pencil.) We're going to need your crime scene investigators up here.  ,8,9
"SCULLY: Very. But this victim here stated that he was going to be killed just moments before he was shot, which doesn't sound lucky at all.  ",8,9
SCULLY: What have you got there?  ,8,9
"SCULLY: Well, there's thermal imaging technology which can pick up body heat through walls. Maybe that's what allowed him to aim.  ",8,9
SCULLY: Chase ran it on foot. He said that somebody was after him. This is probably where it all started.  ,8,9
SCULLY:  Oh.  ,8,9
SCULLY: CHASE did a lot of business with an exterminating company called Triple-A-1 Surekill. Six jobs in one month.  ,8,9
SCULLY: (Looking around) I think Carlton Chase did this.  ,8,9
SCULLY: Unless it was someone outside.  ,8,9
"SCULLY: Well, it's precision marksmanship, that's for sure. These holes line up perfectly with the three victims behind there, which tells me that the shooter was standing right here behind this wall.  ",8,9
"SCULLY: Unless he could see. The light our eyes can register is only one small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Other wavelengths from infra-red to gamma have other properties. X-rays, for instance, can pass through solid objects.  ",8,9
"SCULLY: I am *remarking* that these wavelengths exist and the only thing that is stopping us from seeing them, if you will, is the biochemical structure of our eyes. I am *conjecturing* that if this structure was somehow different we'd have the ability to see things that we don't.  ",8,9
"SCULLY: OK, so you explain it.  ",8,9
SCULLY: Which is?  ,8,9
SCULLY: And how does a dead real estate agent figure into that?  ,8,9
SCULLY: Hello?  ,8,9
SCULLY: It's an insecticide used only by licensed exterminators.  ,8,9
SCULLY: 8:34p.m. We found a call to your office billed on Mr. Chase's calling card. It was made from a payphone not far from where he was murdered.  ,8,9
SCULLY: For Grand Theft Auto.  ,8,9
SCULLY: I assume he had a partner doing the driving.  ,8,9
SCULLY: They share the same birthday. (beat) They're twins.  ,8,9
"SCULLY: Well, maybe there's someone in that office who will.  ",8,9
"SCULLY: I wouldn't be so sure. Can you explain these, Mr. Cooper?  ",8,9
"SCULLY: OK Randall? Let's talk about your exterminating company. There's just the three of you, right? You and your brother and Tammi Peyton?  ",8,9
"SCULLY: So, how is it that your little company billed over $700,000 to Chase Realty last year?  ",8,9
SCULLY: Seven hundred thousand. That's a lot of dead rats. I think that you and your brother and Carlton Chase were in a whole other business together.  ,8,9
SCULLY: Randall?  ,8,9
SCULLY: Is that what your brother just said to Agent Doggett?  ,8,9
"SCULLY: (Quietly, whispering at times) You know why I said that, don't you? Because somehow you can see through that wall. You can see your brother behind me and you can read his lips. I don't know what gives you the ability but I know how you use it. You shoot drug dealers from places where they can't see you and then you and Dwight rob them. That's how you make all that money, isn't it?  ",8,9
"SCULLY: Yeah. You certainly are. And talking to you now, I think that the whole thing is Dwight's idea. It's time to be your own man, Randall. It's time to think for yourself.  ",8,9
SCULLY: Look. Here's where I get confused and I am hoping that you can help me out. Carlton Chase.  ,8,9
SCULLY: Unless the reason wasn't business. (TAMMI looks at SCULLY.) Unless it was personal.  ,8,9
SCULLY: Calls to Carlton Chase.  ,8,9
SCULLY: So Dwight Cooper learns that something's going on between his girl friend and Carlton Chase.  ,8,9
SCULLY: Maybe not.  ,8,9
SCULLY: Maybe Dwight's not the one who's jealous.  ,8,9
SCULLY: Clothes are gone. Tammi left in a hurry. Maybe she thought someone was after her.  ,8,9
SCULLY: You think she planned to go?  ,8,9
SCULLY: Who are you calling?  ,8,9
"SCULLY: No. A County DA came in and he declined representation. Aside from that, he's been uncommunicative.  ",8,9
SCULLY (contemplatively): He watched her every day. Wherever she was. A man who could look at anything in the world and he chooses her. He must have seen something in her that she could not see herself.  ,8,9
"SCULLY:    Well, it's highly unlikely that wherever he is he feels like picking up the phone this morning.  ",8,10
"SCULLY:    Hmm.  It's interesting, isn't it?  I mean, uh... in light of the evidence.  ",8,10
"SCULLY:    From their size and shape, these look like men's shoes.  ",8,10
"SCULLY:    Well, these impressions in the asphalt look pretty fresh to me.  ",8,10
"SCULLY:    You're right, which is suspicious in and of itself.  I mean, this car definitely hit something and the only evidence that we have are these two prints.  ",8,10
"SCULLY:    Well, it looks like he tried to.  ",8,10
SCULLY:    Unless he wanted to stop the car.  ,8,10
SCULLY:    Or certainly no ordinary man.  ,8,10
SCULLY:    Agent Doggett!  ,8,10
SCULLY:    Meet Curtis Delario.  ,8,10
SCULLY:    I guess he won't be much help clearing any of this up.  ,8,10
"SCULLY:    So do I.  It wasn't the crash that killed Curtis Delario.  He was badly injured, but he was clearly still alive when his body was pulled  through the car's windshield.  ",8,10
"SCULLY:    Yeah, these five deep puncture marks match five fingers of one hand.  ",8,10
SCULLY:    Like a bowling ball.  ,8,10
SCULLY:    Certainly for any ordinary man.  ,8,10
SCULLY:    Whose?  ,8,10
SCULLY:    Hmm.  ,8,10
"SCULLY:    Well, if he was recently deceased then it must have been an old print.  ",8,10
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Scully.  ,8,10
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Paint?  ,8,10
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Hang on.  ,8,10
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Uh... no.  Is it significant?  ,8,10
SCULLY:   (on phone)    To do what?  ,8,10
SCULLY:   (on phone)    And you think it was Ray?  ,8,10
SCULLY:    But the man with the gun is dead.  ,8,10
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Or being hit by a car.  ,8,10
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Well, maybe the question's not how but why?  I mean, if Ray Pearce did indeed kill this man what would be his reason?  ",8,10
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Scully.  ,8,10
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Did you find Dr. Clifton?  ,8,10
SCULLY:   (on phone)    What kind of conceptual work?  ,8,10
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    I wonder.  As it happens Ray Pearce's illness is pretty incredible, too.  I've reviewed Ray's medical records from the VA.  What his wife was calling Gulf War Syndrome is nothing of the kind.  His entire cellular makeup was affected by exposure to some non-identifiable contaminant-- a metal.  ",8,10
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Does it, Agent Doggett?  ",8,10
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Well, maybe there's a reason why he's not being perfectly forthcoming.  ",8,10
SCULLY:    It's all right.  I just got the blood test back on Ray Pearce and it was indeed the same Ray Pearce who was pronounced dead three days ago.  But that's not all.  By all medical standards he should still be dead.  His blood has enough metal alloy in it to  uh poison an elephant.  ,8,10
"SCULLY:    But then the question is, why kill his friends?  I mean, if he was wronged somehow wouldn't he go to them for solace?  I mean, to his wife, at least?  ",8,10
SCULLY:    This was ten years ago.  ,8,10
SCULLY:    Until three days ago.  ,8,10
"SCULLY:    Agent Doggett, the man that we're speaking about withstood impact from a speeding car and two shotgun blasts at short range.  Even if we can find him, who's to say we can stop him?  ",8,10
"SCULLY:    Dr. Puvogel, are you sure he can't open that door from the inside?  ",8,10
SCULLY:    Ray Pearce.  ,8,10
SCULLY:    Get it open!  ,8,10
SCULLY:    Agent Doggett.  Look at this.  You see this?  ,8,10
SCULLY:    Turning itself into metal.  ,8,10
SCULLY:    Not without cause.  ,8,10
SCULLY:    Do you recognize this man?  ,8,10
SCULLY:    Of what?  ,8,10
SCULLY:    And it poisoned him.  ,8,10
SCULLY:    (to DOGGETT)   Let me talk to you for a second.  ,8,10
SCULLY:    (quietly)   I think he's telling the truth.  ,8,10
SCULLY:    Who is it?  ,8,10
SCULLY:    She was looking for something.  ,8,10
SCULLY:    That makes three people.  Three people that he's killed and for what?  ,8,10
"SCULLY:    Whatever Ray is, whatever he's become, it was an accident.  It was not those people's fault, Mrs. Pearce.  ",8,10
"SCULLY:    No, they were innocent, just like Ray was.  They didn't know that this was going to happen.  ",8,10
"SCULLY:    Oh, so that's what this is about?  This is about looking for somebody to blame?  ",8,10
"SCULLY:    So who is it?  It's the CEO here?  The owner?  Give us a name, Mrs. Pearce, before someone else has to die.  ",8,10
SCULLY:    Ray Pearce.  ,8,10
"SCULLY:    This man, Owen Harris?  He begged for his life.  It might just have saved him.  His attacker got up and ran away.  ",8,10
"SCULLY:    Wherever Ray Pearce went, the answer to that question went with him but I can tell you why he came after Owen Harris.  It was his name Nora found in the file.  He was the accountant who authorized the shipment of hazardous materials to Southside Salvage.  ",8,10
"SCULLY:    Well, I think that, uh, Nora Pearce may have been right.  Her husband died, or at least his body did.  Whatever killed those people was an abomination of a man.  It was a machine.  ",8,10
SCULLY:    Nor mercy.  Unless what drove Ray to kill is also what saved those people.  ,8,10
SCULLY:    Some flicker of humanity.  ,8,10
SCULLY:    Good morning.  I'm sorry I'm late.  I didn't get a chance to look at the case file.  The traffic's terrible.  ,8,12
SCULLY:    Who are we talking about?  ,8,12
SCULLY:    Did the M.E. See it?  The body?  ,8,12
SCULLY:    No sign of forced entry?  ,8,12
"SCULLY:    So, basically what you're saying is that nobody knows anything.  ",8,12
SCULLY:    (quietly)   A child's print.  ,8,12
SCULLY:    Mm...  ,8,12
"SCULLY:    No. From what I see, Agent Doggett, from the way this man died... I doubt it was a kid who did this.  ",8,12
"SCULLY:    But regardless, I'd say it's wise you keep an open mind.  ",8,12
"SCULLY:    Big is a relative term, Agent Doggett.  It took three strong men to wheel him in here.  He tipped the scale at 402 pounds.  ",8,12
SCULLY:    I'm missing the point.  ,8,12
"SCULLY:    Well, considering what I found here today I'd say I have to agree.  ",8,12
SCULLY:    Tissue damage.  Massive trauma to the lower intestine and the rectal wall.  ,8,12
"SCULLY:    Well, unfortunately there's so much damage that it's hard to tell.  ",8,12
"SCULLY:    I took MRIs, which reveal further shredding throughout the abdomen and, uh, into the stomach area.  ",8,12
SCULLY:    Are you suggesting that he's a mule?  A courier of heroine or opiates?  Drug dealer?  ,8,12
"SCULLY:    Well, I'd say, uh, that's a good theory, Agent Doggett, not to mention a graphic one, but there would have been traces left of drugs in his system.  Nor does it account for the blood loss that this man experienced.  ",8,12
"SCULLY:    Not exactly.  I ran a decay analysis to, uh, determine the time of death. Liver temperature, buildup of gases, extent of rigor-- routine stuff.  It's not 100% accurate, but it gives us a range.  ",8,12
SCULLY:    24 to 36 hours.  ,8,12
"SCULLY:    Well, it would mean that, uh, Mr. Potocki here would have died before he left Bombay.  ",8,12
SCULLY:    I told you to keep an open mind.  ,8,12
SCULLY:    Bad connection?  ,8,12
"SCULLY:    Look at this.  Albert Brecht's passport was a recent issue and it has his weight at 205 pounds whereas here, an Indian medical examiner has him listed at 238 pounds just two hours after his death.  ",8,12
"SCULLY:    Well, that's a pretty big lie.  I mean, that's a 33 pound discrepancy.  ",8,12
SCULLY:    Yeah.  As was our DC victim.  All the better for accommodation.  ,8,12
"SCULLY:    (slowly)   Well, something has to account for the weight gain, Agent Doggett.  What if, whatever it is that killed these men entered and exited them of its own free will?  I mean, something.... small... with small hands... living... inside the victims as a... as a stowaway of sorts.  ",8,12
"SCULLY:    I understand, Agent Doggett and I can't prove it... but I bet that if we had weighed Hugh Potocki when he first arrived here from Bombay that he would have been 33 pounds heavier than his corpse.  ",8,12
SCULLY:    I appreciate your resistance but so far this evidence supports it.  ,8,12
SCULLY:    Yeah.  That's not all he claims he saw.  ,8,12
SCULLY:    He said he called his dad in because there was something in his room.  I asked him to describe it.  He said that it was a munchkin.  That it had no legs.  And that it was keeping itself up with its arms.  ,8,12
SCULLY:    How can you be sure?  ,8,12
"SCULLY:    Right.  Which is exactly what the boy said that his father did.  But it's the father that I have a problem with here.  I mean he had none of the massive hemorrhaging that we found in Mr. Potocki.  In the coroner's initial report, he makes it sound like the guy died of a cerebral embolism.  The one salient detail in the external exam were the eyes... in which only the blood vessels are broken.  ",8,12
SCULLY:    Unless that's just the first stage.  ,8,12
"SCULLY:    This is Special Agent Dana Scully.  I am a medical doctor about to perform an unauthorized procedure on a body.  The, uh  the subject is a Caucasian male.  Age, uh... I don't remember at this particular time.  His height is about six feet.  And his weight is... quite possibly subject to change.  ",8,12
SCULLY:    I suppose distention could be due to decomposition gases... but that seems unlikely.  ,8,12
SCULLY:    Oh.  ,8,12
SCULLY:    Agent Mulder consulted with Dr. Burks on occasion and I have to admit that I've been skeptical of him in the past but he does have certain insights.  ,8,12
SCULLY:    These ascetic masters... they have abilities?  ,8,12
"SCULLY:    Chuck... Could one of these Siddhi mystics make you believe that he vanished in a room when in fact, he's standing right in front of you?  ",8,12
SCULLY:    What?  ,8,12
"SCULLY:    Chuck.  Thank you for, uh, coming down here again.  ",8,12
"SCULLY:    This, uh... this case, I-I-I-I'm just... I'm trying to see it the way that Mulder would and... please have a seat.  ",8,12
"SCULLY:    You described these, uh, Siddhi mystics as being religious men.  ",8,12
"SCULLY:    So, presumably using those powers for murder would be in opposition of that?  ",8,12
"SCULLY:    Which got me thinking that, uh... if these Siddhi hold so fast to their orthodoxy then what would cause them to break their faith?  ",8,12
SCULLY:    Something human?  ,8,12
SCULLY:    Revenge?  ,8,12
"SCULLY:    This is... an American chemical plant in a village in India called, uh, Vishi. It's just outside of Mumbai which is a better known to us as Bombay.  About six months ago the plant inadvertently released a small cloud of methyl isocyanate gas.  118 of Vishi's mostly indigenous population were killed.  But it wasn't very well reported over here.  I spent all night cross-checking the, uh, victims of the disaster.  And one... finally caught my attention.  ",8,12
"SCULLY:    Now, I'd say, right here.  It's an 11-year-old boy... whose father is described as being a holy man of the Chamar caste.  ",8,12
SCULLY:    Do you think that this boy's father could be a Siddhi mystic like you described?  ,8,12
SCULLY:    She came out to call her son in for dinner.  That's all we know.  ,8,12
SCULLY:    What are we doing?  A woman died of mysterious circumstances not three blocks away from a previous victim.  External signs are a direct match.  That woman's eyes.  ,8,12
SCULLY:    Are you questioning my integrity?  ,8,12
SCULLY:    I asked you to keep an open mind.  ,8,12
"SCULLY:    There is something here, Agent Doggett.  And I'll admit that it's hard to accept.  But there is a motive and there is a pattern and there is a reason and we will see it...  but not working like this.  ",8,12
"SCULLY:    Trevor.  Trevor, I'm Dana Scully...  ",8,12
SCULLY:    Your father's in the house.  I'm going to take...  ,8,12
SCULLY:    (gently)   Trevor.  ,8,12
"SCULLY:    Sir, I am so sorry to bother you again.  I know this has been a terrible ordeal.  ",8,12
"SCULLY:    I need to speak with your son, Trevor, again.  ",8,12
"SCULLY:    Well, Trevor told me that he saw a man... It was just something that doesn't quite add up and I need to be certain.  ",8,12
SCULLY:    Thank you.  ,8,12
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Scully.  ,8,12
SCULLY:   (on phone)    What?  ,8,12
"SCULLY:    I'm sorry, just hang on one second.  ",8,12
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Agent Doggett what do you mean he's not there?  ,8,12
"SCULLY:    Oh, thank god.  ",8,12
"SCULLY:    Quinton, what's the matter?  ",8,12
SCULLY:    Who?  Trevor?  ,8,12
"SCULLY:    Okay, don't move.  Stay where you are.  ",8,12
SCULLY:    I can't.  ,8,12
SCULLY:    (voice breaking)   I shot a young boy.  ,8,12
"SCULLY:    But it's what I saw.  With my eyes, anyway.  Do you know what it's like not to be able to trust your own eyes?  ",8,12
SCULLY:    Because it's what the boy saw.  And in an instant I realized that it's what Mulder would have seen or understood.  ,8,12
SCULLY:    Because that's just how he came at things... without judgment and without prejudice and with an open mind that I am just not capable of.  ,8,12
"SCULLY:    No...  it did.  In some way, it did.  ",8,12
SCULLY:    Yes.  Is the assessment team here?  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    Sir, se appreciate the pressure that you're under, but...  ",8,13
SCULLY:    I'm afraid you can't do that.  ,8,13
SCULLY:    You've got a dead man who's got over 1/3 of his body tissue completely eaten away and until we figure out how and why that tunnel cannot be reopened.  ,8,13
SCULLY:    Simple?  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    No, it didn't, that's the thing.  Until we culture the tissue and run the proper tests we're not going to know what killed him or if it can infect others.  ",8,13
SCULLY:    We were told you folks said that the tunnel was free of pathogens.  ,8,13
SCULLY:    (slightly uncomfortable)   Deaths for which there may be many explanations or for which an explanation may be hard to find.  ,8,13
SCULLY:    No.  You're going in without me.  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    I don't know what kinds of game are being played, but I'm going to be much more effective analysing the situation from up here.  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    You've got capable people with you, Agent Doggett.  What I need down there are eyes and ears.  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)   Third rail's powering down.  You're clear to enter the subway floor and as long as you stay on this line there should be no risk of accidental shock or electrocution.  You copy that, Agent Doggett?  ",8,13
SCULLY:    (on radio)   We got you every step of the way.  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)   Agent Doggett, you still reading me down there?  ",8,13
SCULLY:    (on radio)   What just happened?  ,8,13
SCULLY:    (on radio)   Yeah. Ask Dr. Lyle if she can get a sample.  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)   Yeah, I got it.  I'm getting a reading... Sample analysis is showing carbon, bromide, boron and calcium.  ",8,13
SCULLY:    (on radio)   Let me get on the phone.  Maybe I can get a molecular analysis.  ,8,13
SCULLY:    (on radio)   Yeah.  It's a fork in the line.  ,8,13
SCULLY:    (on radio)   It's about a mile up the main tunnel.  ,8,13
SCULLY:    (on radio)   Agent Doggett.  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio, warning tone)   Agent Doggett...  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)   Agent Doggett, what happened?  Can you hear me?  ",8,13
SCULLY:    (on radio)   What did?  Agent Doggett.  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)    Uh, okay, I see it.  Um, I'm going to need some data.  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    Oh, my god.  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)   Yeah, I see them.  Can you get any closer?  ",8,13
SCULLY:    (on radio)   Can you get them uncovered?  ,8,13
SCULLY:    (on radio)   I see signs of the same tissue degradation we saw in the other victims.  We may have a contagion here after all.  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio, worried)   Agent Doggett?  ",8,13
SCULLY:    (on radio)   Agent Doggett...  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)   Agent Doggett, if there's somebody else down there you're going to need to find him.  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    ""Those people"" just found three dead bodies and I want to know what happened to them.  ",8,13
SCULLY:    You don't understand.  They could be infected and contagious.  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    (angrily)   Then, who are those dead men and how did they die?  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    Then take a look at the man who fits the description of your killer, okay?  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    Just look at his injuries, sir.  He died the same way.  There is something down there and I am not going to risk bringing it up here before I figure out what it is!  ",8,13
SCULLY:    (on radio)   Yeah?  ,8,13
SCULLY:    (on radio)   I want you to leave those bodies where you found them and go after whoever it is who's in that tunnel.  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)   We need to know whether he is causing this or if he's infected himself.  Either way, he may kill more people.  I'm sure Dr. Lyle will agree.  ",8,13
SCULLY:    (on radio)   Agent Doggett?  ,8,13
SCULLY:    (on radio)   You all right down there?  ,8,13
SCULLY:    (on radio)   You're about 50 yards from the spot where the train stopped.  ,8,13
SCULLY:    (on radio)   I don't know.  Anything.  ,8,13
SCULLY:     (on radio)   What is it?  What's happening?  Agent Doggett?!  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)   Yeah, um, get some fresh water on it!  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)   I don't know what to say... I, mean, i-it's something attacking the dermis.  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)   I hate to say this, Agent Doggett but it looks like it could be some kind of biochemical  weapon.  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)   Agent Doggett, I pulled up a map of the subway grid where you are now.  I want you to listen to me.  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    Dr. Lyle...  Dr. Lyle, how are you feeling?  ",8,13
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    Well, we got vehicles on the way.  The CDC doctors have been informed of your conditions.  ",8,13
SCULLY:    I'm working on that.  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    Hey!  What are you doing?!  Hey, where are you taking them?  Those bodies go to the CDC...  Look, as a federal agent I order you to stop and explain yourself.  ",8,13
SCULLY:    These bodies need immediate examination and diagnosis.  ,8,13
SCULLY:    By whom?  I already arranged it.  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    (accusing)   You knew those bodies were down there, didn't you?  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    Look at the way they're wrapped.  Somebody sealed them in plastic, hoping they wouldn't be found.  Look, if I find out you sent my partner and those others down there knowing about this...  ",8,13
SCULLY:    I want to see inspection reports.  I want to know who was down there in that tunnel and what they saw.  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    Good.  Now, let's get these bodies to the CDC where they're supposed to go.  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)   Agent Doggett?  Agent Doggett, can you...  Agent Doggett? Come in, Agent Doggett. Agent Doggett!  Come in, damn it!  ",8,13
SCULLY:    Excuse me?  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    No... Yes... I mean, I'm-I'm she.  Can I help you?  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    I'm sorry.  Yes, Dr. Bowe, please.  Um... Did you get an analysis?  ",8,13
SCULLY:    Calcium?  ,8,13
SCULLY:    So you're saying that this is a sea creature?  (realizing)  Which is why the CDC missed it.  ,8,13
SCULLY:    It's killing people.  ,8,13
SCULLY:    I don't know.  There is seawater in that subway tunnel and it's eating people's flesh off.  It's producing some kind of a  a reaction that looks almost electrical.  ,8,13
SCULLY:    No. Something triggers it.  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    No, I have not.  But my partner is down there, and I fear the worst.  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)   Agent Doggett?  Agent Doggett, can you hear me?  Agent Doggett?  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    (relieved, on radio)   Oh, you had me.  I, uh... I started fearing the worst.  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)   And what's your condition, Agent Doggett?  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)   I'm going to send a quarantine unit down to get you, Agent Doggett, okay?  I want you to stay right where you are.  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    Dr. Bowe, I need you to get on the phone with the CDC.  Tell them everything we know.  We have to learn as quickly as possible what sets this thing off.  ",8,13
SCULLY:    Look...  I need you to blockade any and every exit from the system.  You've got a possible outbreak situation here.  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    No, you listen to me.  Your lieutenant is infected and at large in the system and he is looking for a way out.  ",8,13
SCULLY:    (on radio)   Agent Doggett...  We've got a new wrinkle.  ,8,13
SCULLY:    (on radio)   We're running out of time.  It's 20 to 4:00.  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)   Agent Doggett, you shouldn't be moving at all.  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)   This organism that's on your skin-- something triggers it, and I don't know what.  It could be body temperature.  It could be heart rate.  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)   Yeah, I guess you're right.  ",8,13
SCULLY:    (on radio)   He's got passengers waiting at the next station.  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    You see this, Dr. Bowe?  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    You see this, Mr. Karras?  ",8,13
SCULLY:    You're on with the CDC?  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    I need anything they can give me about what sets this organism off-- an idea, a notion, a wild guess.  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)   Get out of there, Agent Doggett.  ",8,13
SCULLY:    (on radio)   I'm going to send a hazmat team down for him but from what I've seen the reaction's progressive.  ,8,13
SCULLY:    (on radio)   Yeah.  ,8,13
SCULLY:    (on radio)   What's he pointing at?  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)   Agent Doggett, turn the light away.  ",8,13
SCULLY:    I think I just figured it out.  I might know what triggers this.  ,8,13
SCULLY:    (on radio)   Sweat.  Perspiration is a conductor for calcium ions promoting a chemical-electrical reaction.  ,8,13
SCULLY:    (on radio)   That's right.  And since the boy's sweat glands aren't fully developed then he wouldn't be as conductive.  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)    Agent Doggett, where's he going?  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)   Yeah. I'm...  I'm checking my graphic here.  It... It looks like he's trying to lead you through to a tunnel on the main system.  And, if what I'm looking at is accurate, it would put you about 400 yards from an access point.  I mean, if I could put a hazmat team together we might be able to have you out in about 15 minutes.  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)   Yes, we do.  ",8,13
SCULLY:    (on radio)   No. It's worse than that.  I think this moron Karras has started the trains rolling.  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)   Agent Doggett what are you doing?  Agent Doggett...  Get off the tracks, Agent Doggett.  Get out of there!  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)   Get out of there, Agent Doggett!  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)   Agent Doggett?  Talk to me, Agent Doggett.  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)   Agent Doggett, are you there?  Can you hear me?  ",8,13
SCULLY:    (on radio)   Thank god.  Uh... I lost you on the visual.  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    (on radio)   Okay...  Okay, I've got you.  You're back.  ",8,13
SCULLY:    (on radio)   Are you okay?  ,8,13
SCULLY:    Where do you think you're going?  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    Well, you're not... Agent Doggett.  Your skin and body have been rid of the organism.  Simple alcohol bath cleaned you right up.  I was just down talking to the nurse and I told her I'd come and give you the news.  ",8,13
SCULLY:    Yes.  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    Well, the kid is with Social Services and plastic surgeons are working on Melnick and Bianco and Dr. Lyle has been discharged.  ",8,13
"SCULLY:    No.  It's over, Agent Doggett.  ",8,13
SCULLY:    (holding up a file)   But there is no proof of that.  ,8,13
SCULLY:    What I'm saying is that the organism is no longer extant.  It's destroyed.  ,8,13
SCULLY:    I'm guessing by the electrical charge that you set off.  ,8,13
SCULLY:    Infected by a pathogen of unknown aetiology.  ,8,13
"SCULLY:    Look, Agent Doggett, not a criminal charge is going to stick.  These guys were just doing their job-- keeping the trains running.  ",8,13
SCULLY:    But they've got you to thank.  And not just for saving their butts.  ,8,13
SCULLY:    Let's go home.  ,8,13
SCULLY:    Hi.  ,8,14
SCULLY:    You said on the phone you'd received something urgent.  ,8,14
SCULLY:    You going to tell me what it is?  ,8,14
SCULLY:    What?  What is it?  ,8,14
"SCULLY:    All right, what's going on here?  ",8,14
SCULLY:    What kind of encounter?  ,8,14
"SCULLY:    Assistant Director, I've got drawers full of reports that begin just like that. Are you going to tell me what's so important about this case?  ",8,14
SCULLY:    (voice breaking)   Are you trying to tell me this has something to do with Mulder?  ,8,14
SCULLY:    Teresa Hoese was the young mother who was abducted the night before Agent Mulder was.  ,8,14
SCULLY:    Returned?  ,8,14
SCULLY:    What is her condition?  ,8,14
"SCULLY:    (avoiding his eyes, hand over her mouth)   In the x-rays, did you see, um... anything else?  Foreign objects.  ",8,14
SCULLY:    Little pieces of metal.  Implants.  ,8,14
"SCULLY:    You do... Richie.  From Oregon.  We met late last spring, you remember?  ",8,14
SCULLY:    Agent Doggett?  What was that in there?  ,8,14
SCULLY:    You refuse to believe that anything other than a man could have done this. Could have done what we saw to that woman in the hospital.  ,8,14
"SCULLY:    And for months, we have been looking for a break, which is what we've got here.  ",8,14
SCULLY:    (weakly)   What if he's dead?  ,8,14
SCULLY:    I'm sorry.  I just had a bad dream.  ,8,14
SCULLY:    I once had a talk with Mulder about starlight.  How it's billions of years old.  ,8,14
"SCULLY:      Stars that are now long dead whose light is still traveling through time.  It won't die, that light.  ",8,14
SCULLY:    Maybe that's the only thing that never does.  He said that's where souls reside.  I hope he's right.  ,8,14
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Yeah?   Hold on.  Who took her?   Well, has anybody talked to the doctor and asked him why?  Or where?   Well, where's Agent Doggett now?  ",8,14
SCULLY:    Did you find her?  ,8,14
SCULLY:    No?  I don't understand.  You called us all the way out here.  ,8,14
"SCULLY:    Another point of view?  We have a patient missing, Agent Doggett.  ",8,14
SCULLY:    Hear who out?  ,8,14
SCULLY:    Expertise in what?  ,8,14
SCULLY:    Ritualistic crime?  Are we working the same case here?  ,8,14
SCULLY:    Interesting?  ,8,14
SCULLY:    Isn't that what you're here to tell us?  ,8,14
"SCULLY:    I'm sorry, this feels like therapy.  ",8,14
"SCULLY:    What ""who"" wants to have happened?  ",8,14
"SCULLY:    It may involve someone close to me.  Can we stick to the facts, please?  ",8,14
SCULLY:    Did you happen to know the peculiar nature of her injuries?  ,8,14
SCULLY:    But you think that it is.  ,8,14
"SCULLY:    So, what do you think happened?  ",8,14
SCULLY:    So you're basically saying that Agent Mulder has joined some sort of UFO cult.  ,8,14
SCULLY:    I see.  ,8,14
SCULLY:    Are you asking me to believe this?  ,8,14
SCULLY:    Based on what?  ,8,14
"SCULLY:    I'm glad you agree with her, Agent Doggett, because I'm not even sure that she agrees with you.  Nor has she made any sense for me of how the doctor who removed Teresa Hoese from the hospital last night seems, by all accounts to have been in two places at once.  ",8,14
SCULLY:    Enjoy your new company.  ,8,14
SCULLY:    I thought you'd be out combing the hills with Agent Doggett.  ,8,14
"SCULLY:    Is there something you're looking for, Agent Reyes in particular?  ",8,14
SCULLY:    Implants?  I don't understand.  ,8,14
"SCULLY:    Yeah, I'm well aware of how they work.  ",8,14
SCULLY:    I don't understand your interest in what is commonly considered evidence of alien abduction as a disbeliever in that phenomena.  ,8,14
"SCULLY:    Excuse me.  I, I, uh, I'm very confused.  I know what I heard and I heard you say that what we're dealing with here is nothing more than a UFO cult.  ",8,14
SCULLY:    You believe in extraterrestrials?  ,8,14
SCULLY:    What is it you specialize in again?  Ritualistic crime?  ,8,14
SCULLY:    We should talk sometime.  ,8,14
SCULLY:    And what beliefs are those?  ,8,14
SCULLY:    And do you have any feelings about Agent Mulder?  ,8,14
"SCULLY:    (speaking with difficulty into recorder)   Examination of victim, Gary Edward Cory, reveals cuts and abrasions from ligature or binding devices accompanied by distal and proximal bruising radiating in a symmetrical pattern around the ankles, the wrists... and the face.  ",8,14
"SCULLY:    You can go now, Richie.  They just need you to sign a form.  ",8,14
SCULLY:    I'm okay.  There's work to do here.  ,8,14
SCULLY:    Teresa.  ,8,14
SCULLY:    You better get AD Skinner in to see this.  And Agent Doggett.  ,8,14
SCULLY:    (gently)   Agent Doggett.  ,8,14
"SCULLY:    You, uh... you say that these abductees are returned with severe injuries. But that doesn't fit the pattern of any alien abduction model.  ",8,14
"SCULLY:    Sir... given the criminal charges against you, you couldn't be a less credible witness so stop trying to validate your theories and just give us the truth.  ",8,14
SCULLY:    So these video cameras that you have around your compound-- how do they help?  ,8,14
SCULLY:    Do you have videotape of how you happened to heal Teresa Hoese?  ,8,14
SCULLY:    (whisper)   I asked you to give me the truth.  ,8,14
SCULLY:    (weakly)    Do you have videotape of this man?  ,8,14
SCULLY:   (wistfully)   I saw him.  ,8,14
SCULLY:    I saw something.  ,8,14
SCULLY:    Who is it?  ,8,14
"SCULLY:    Well, then where's another angle?  ",8,14
SCULLY:    Wait a minute. Stop it.  ,8,14
SCULLY:    That man.  I know that man.  ,8,14
SCULLY:    His name is Jeremiah Smith.  Agent Mulder knew him.  He believed that he had the ability to heal people.  ,8,14
SCULLY:    Like he did Teresa Hoese.  ,8,14
SCULLY:    Wow.  That's still Jeremiah Smith.  ,8,14
SCULLY:    Exactly.  We have to get back out there.  ,8,14
SCULLY:    (getting out of the car)   We're looking for someone.  A man who may be one of the detainees.  ,8,14
SCULLY:    FBI.  Where is he?  Jeremiah Smith.  ,8,14
"SCULLY:    Look, I know he's here.  Jeremiah Smith.  I need to speak with him.  ",8,14
SCULLY:    You-- in the back.  Step out.  ,8,14
SCULLY:    Come with me.  ,8,14
SCULLY:    Take a seat.  ,8,14
SCULLY:    Are you Jeremiah Smith?  ,8,14
SCULLY:    Did you heal these people?  ,8,14
SCULLY:    Did you heal Teresa Hoese?  ,8,14
"SCULLY:    Look, I know who you are.  ",8,14
SCULLY:    Where's Mulder?  ,8,14
SCULLY:    Where is Mulder?  ,8,14
SCULLY:    What is it?  ,8,14
SCULLY:    Where is he?  ,8,14
SCULLY:    How bad is he?  ,8,14
SCULLY:    How bad is he?  ,8,14
SCULLY:    How bad is he hurt?  ,8,14
SCULLY:    He needs help!  ,8,14
SCULLY:    Jeremiah.  ,8,14
SCULLY:    No...  no.  This is not happening!  ,8,14
SCULLY:    No!  ,8,14
SCULLY:      Where's Mulder?  ,8,15
SCULLY:   No...  no  (screams)    No...!!!!!  ,8,15
SCULLY:      He was the last.  His father and mother... his sister... all gone.  I think the real tragedy... is that for all of his pain and searching... the truth that he worked so hard to find was never truly revealed to him.  ,8,15
SCULLY:      (her voice begins to break)    I can't truly believe that I'm really standing here.  ,8,15
SCULLY:      I'm fine.  How are you feeling?  ,8,15
SCULLY:      A.D. Skinner just called.  He told me about your meeting with Kersh.  ,8,15
"SCULLY:      You'd be crazy to stay, Agent Doggett.  This is a huge career opportunity for you.  ",8,15
SCULLY:      What do you mean?  ,8,15
"SCULLY:      You don't owe me anything, Agent Doggett.  ",8,15
SCULLY:      I heard the same speech come out of my mouth seven years ago.  ,8,15
"SCULLY:      Get out while you can, Agent Doggett... or you may never get out at all.  ",8,15
SCULLY:      Is it true?  ,8,15
SCULLY:      No. I want to see him.  ,8,15
"SCULLY:      (frenzied)   No, I need to see him, damn it!  ",8,15
"SCULLY:      (desperate, whisper)  Tell me it's true.  Tell me.  ",8,15
SCULLY:      What did they say?  ,8,15
SCULLY:      I need to see him.  ,8,15
"SCULLY:      Nothing.  I was just looking in on the patient and he started to go into grand mal seizure.  I, uh, I-I think he's all right now.  Um, it's okay.  I'm, uh, sorry   (she shows her badge)   ...  I'm a doctor.  My name is Scully, and I'm with the FBI.  ",8,15
"SCULLY:      No. No, I, uh... the man down the hall was my... is my partner and we knew Billy and I-I guess I was just hoping that there might be some indication that he was getting better... somehow.  Anyway... um... you might want to tell the doctor about this. And, uh... and check those monitors carefully.  I think I might have seen some kind of equipment malfunction.  ",8,15
"SCULLY:      You asked me not to come in here, Agent Doggett.  I hope you're not asking me to leave.  ",8,15
SCULLY:      You mean finding Mulder alive?  ,8,15
"SCULLY:      Agent Doggett... ...However I felt about you when we first met, you changed my opinion with the quality of your character and of your work.  Now, I am thankful to know you and I am thankful for your concern... ...But no matter what Mulder's chances are the choice not to open up that grave was wrong.  And not because of me personally but as my partner on the X-Files.  Now, the truth may hurt but it's all that matters.  ",8,15
SCULLY:      About what caused this.  ,8,15
"SCULLY:      That's not what you mean... is it, Billy?  You mean... a spacecraft.  ",8,15
SCULLY:      Agent Doggett...  Where are you going?  ,8,15
"SCULLY:      You just won't believe it, will you?   Not even for a minute.  Not even with it staring you right in the face.  ",8,15
"SCULLY:      Agent Doggett, you spoke with his doctors.  He was lying on his deathbed.  ",8,15
"SCULLY:      I underestimated you, Agent Doggett.  I thought this was just simple... resistance to extreme possibilities... when, in fact, you're just downright bullheaded.  ",8,15
SCULLY:      Hi.  ,8,15
SCULLY:      I know.  I'm sorry.  ,8,15
"SCULLY:      It's too incredible.  Sir, there isn't a piece of medical data on him that isn't 100% normal.  ",8,15
"SCULLY:      Because it doesn't make sense.  I mean, there should be blood, fluid, electrolyte imbalances.  Loss of brain function, but as it is, it's like he shed his skin and literally became a new person.  And I don't mean the same person.  ",8,15
"SCULLY:      Why are you asking me this?  Sir, if you know something... look, we-we're working against the clock here.  This, this could happen to Mulder.  And until we know what it is we have to do everything to control it.  ",8,15
SCULLY:      Where?  ,8,15
SCULLY:      This is about saving a man's life.  ,8,15
"SCULLY:      Look, I don't have time to waste debating our differences, Agent Doggett. I strongly believe that Agent Mulder is infected with a virus.  ",8,15
SCULLY:      A virus that seems to keep the body just alive enough to take it through a transformation...  ,8,15
"SCULLY:      Agent Doggett, I don't have time to argue.  ",8,15
SCULLY:      He told you this was a virus?  ,8,15
SCULLY:      That's it.  ,8,15
"SCULLY:      How Billy Miles came back so perfectly.  I stood there and watched his body go into seizure just moments before this happened.  On the monitor, there were two heartbeats and I told the nurse that it was just a mechanical error.  ",8,15
SCULLY:      And it'll happen to Mulder if we don't stop it soon.  ,8,15
"SCULLY:      I need a surgical bay, a team of doctors.  I have to keep Mulder's body stabilized in order to administer the vaccine.  ",8,15
SCULLY:      The one I asked AD Skinner to get me.  ,8,15
SCULLY:      I don't know.  I... I really don't know how we could've known.  ,8,15
SCULLY:      That by keeping him on life support we were incubating the virus.  We were hastening it along.  ,8,15
"SCULLY:      When Skinner pulled Mulder off of the machines, his temperature dropped rapidly without affecting his vital signs.  ",8,15
SCULLY:      If we can stabilize him and his temperature we can give him courses of antivirals.  I think it could work.  ,8,15
SCULLY:      Mulder...  ,8,15
SCULLY:      Hi.  ,8,15
"SCULLY:      Oh, my god.  Don't do that to me.  ",8,15
SCULLY:      Do you know...?  Do you have any idea what you've been through?  ,8,15
"SCULLY:(On phone) The Deputy Director is waiting, Agent Doggett.  ",8,16
SCULLY: (On screen) Why didn't you tell me you were pursuing the Texas oil worker case?  ,8,16
SCULLY: Well there's an executive here from the oil company who says he was contacted by a man in our office.  ,8,16
SCULLY: What are you talking about?  ,8,16
SCULLY: Who else are we talking about?  ,8,16
SCULLY: Close the door and lock it.  ,8,16
"SCULLY: I didn't know who else to talk to, and I haven't been able to reach Agent Mulder.  ",8,16
"SCULLY: About what I found in my autopsy of the oil rig victim, Simon de la Cruz  ",8,16
SCULLY: I found it by accident in the third ventricle of his brain.  ,8,16
"SCULLY: No it's OK, it's alright.  ",8,16
"SCULLY: No, it can, and I've seen that happen. But that's the thing - this man was clearly infected by the alien virus. It entered his system and it was massing in the pineal gland, but it's dead.  ",8,16
"SCULLY: Well intuitively, you would say the same thing that killed him - exposure to high levels of radiation. But it makes no sense because the virus itself has radioactive properties.  ",8,16
"SCULLY: No, you need to tell Deputy Director Kersh that he has to order a controlled evacuation of that rig right now.  ",8,16
"SCULLY: If the virus is loose, Agent Doggett's life is in danger.  ",8,16
"SCULLY: Orpheus, I've been trying to reach you for hours. This is Special Agent Dana Scully. I have an urgent message for an investigative agent on board, an Agent John Doggett.  ",8,16
"SCULLY: No I'm sorry, I need to speak with Agent Doggett directly.  ",8,16
SCULLY: (Surprised) Mulder?  ,8,16
SCULLY: Mulder you can't just flout orders like this. It's not like old times. Kersh isn't going to tolerate this.  ,8,16
SCULLY: (Worried) Mulder.  ,8,16
SCULLY: I'd hate to say as of this morning I'd have to agree.  ,8,16
"SCULLY: Yes I did, and it's dead Mulder.  ",8,16
SCULLY: Possibly radiation.  ,8,16
"SCULLY: I know I know, and this could be an isolated event, but that he's infected at all means that everybody out there could be at risk. And that means you and Agent Doggett.  ",8,16
"SCULLY: No Mulder, you need to get off the rig. Have Agent Doggett give the order. We can quarantine you and the crew when we get back here.  ",8,16
SCULLY: And what if I can't?  ,8,16
SCULLY: Let me talk to Agent Doggett.  ,8,16
SCULLY: This man was exposed to a virus.  ,8,16
SCULLY: To understand what your crew may be infected with. What they risk spreading on or off that rig.  ,8,16
"SCULLY: Unexplained behaviour, possible detection in the eyes ..  ",8,16
SCULLY: Oh my god.  ,8,16
SCULLY: Sir?  ,8,16
"SCULLY: To continue with my work, Sir.  ",8,16
"SCULLY: We could do that Sir, but all radio contact has been cut off.  ",8,16
"SCULLY: Sir, I think that would be a mistake ...  ",8,16
SCULLY: (Offscreen) I think I've got something.  ,8,16
SCULLY: (Offscreen) This is an SEM image pulled at random from anonymous donors.  ,8,16
"SCULLY: Blood. More specifically, normal T-cell antibodies. By comparison these are from the blood of the oil rig worker (A new image appears, showing many more objects on the screen) T-cells in impossible numbers. In layman's terms, this victim was a virus fighting machine.  ",8,16
"SCULLY: Well, there are isolated cultures. In northern Italy for one, where people are immune to certain diseases - heart disease in that case, through a genetic mutation.  ",8,16
"SCULLY: Well his employment records list Mr. Simon de la Cruz as of mixed Mexican ancestry, when in fact he is Waicha Indian. The Waicha are an indigenous Mexican culture that has a rare undiluted gene pool. Now these genes may have an innate immunity to infection.  ",8,16
"SCULLY: No, not burned. Irradiated. (SCULLY pulls the sheet from the body.) Because the virus had no effect on him. The crew members who were affected by the virus couldn't control him, so they killed him, by irradiating him.  ",8,16
"SCULLY: This man must have been a threat, because of something he knew.  ",8,16
SCULLY: That I don't know.  ,8,16
SCULLY: Agent Doggett?  ,8,16
SCULLY: Can you hear me?  ,8,16
SCULLY: What was that?  ,8,16
"SCULLY: Mulder, listen to me.  ",8,16
"SCULLY: I think I know why they killed this man, if not how they killed him.  ",8,16
SCULLY: We've got choppers on the way.  ,8,16
SCULLY:    Mulder?  ,8,17
SCULLY:    I was just about to jump in the shower but I was waiting for the pizza man.  ,8,17
SCULLY:    The pizza man?  ,8,17
"SCULLY:    No, what I mean was the pizza man's usually late, and so...  ",8,17
SCULLY:    You want to come in?  ,8,17
SCULLY:    I feel like I'm stuck in an episode of Mad About You.  ,8,17
"SCULLY:    Yeah, well, you know what I'm talking about.  ",8,17
"SCULLY:    Ah, I see.  ",8,17
SCULLY:    Is that for me?  ,8,17
SCULLY:    Nice package.  ,8,17
SCULLY:    What's the occasion?  ,8,17
"SCULLY:    Well, I'm touched.  ",8,17
"SCULLY:    Hi... just, uh, give it to the man with the funny look on his face.  ",8,17
"SCULLY:    What are you doing, Agent Doggett?  ",8,17
"SCULLY:    I'm, uh... I feel all druggy.  Do you mind?  ",8,17
SCULLY:    Thank you.  ,8,17
SCULLY:    Who's we?  ,8,17
"SCULLY:    What's wrong, Agent Doggett?  You don't seem too good yourself.  ",8,17
SCULLY:    Mm-hmm.  ,8,17
"SCULLY:    I realized it was me, that I was afraid.  Afraid to believe.  ",8,17
SCULLY:    Why do you ask?  ,8,17
"SCULLY:    Agent Doggett, why do you ask?  ",8,17
SCULLY:   Yeah.  ,8,17
SCULLY:    That I had a partial abruption.  Which means that my placenta started to tear away from the uterine wall.  They're going to need to monitor me for awhile.  ,8,17
SCULLY:    Yeah.  ,8,17
SCULLY:    Where have you been?  ,8,17
SCULLY:    Agent Reyes.  ,8,17
SCULLY:    I like her.  ,8,17
"SCULLY:    Well, then neither are you and I.  So this is a case you're working on?  ",8,17
"SCULLY:    Yeah, he's never talked to me about him, but I know something.  Are you able to help him at all?  ",8,17
"SCULLY:    He's worth the effort, Mulder.  ",8,17
"SCULLY:    Mulder, you never fail to surprise me.  I just wish I felt like eating it right now.  ",8,17
SCULLY:    Yes.  That's okay. He's coming by later.  ,8,17
"SCULLY:    No, I didn't, actually.  I thought about it a lot while I was lying in my hospital bed wondering what on earth you could have given me.  ",8,17
"SCULLY:    Oh, my god.  Oh, Mulder.  ",8,17
SCULLY:    Not even close.  ,8,17
"SCULLY:    But then that's the other gift that you gave me, Mulder.  ",8,17
SCULLY:    Courage... to believe.  And I hope that's a gift I can pass on.  ,8,17
SCULLY:      I can't truly believe I'm really standing here.  ,8,18
"SCULLY:      Blood, electrolyte imbalances, a loss of brain function.   I strongly believe that Mulder is infected with alien virus.  ",8,18
SCULLY:      If we can stabilize him and his temperature we can give him courses of antivirals.  I think it could work.  ,8,18
"SCULLY:      Mulder, you okay?  ",8,18
"SCULLY:      Well, you might want to consider sitting down when you hear what we have to tell you.  ",8,18
"SCULLY:      Now, it's, uh... it's good news.  It's... it's miraculous news.  ",8,18
"SCULLY:      Whatever neurological disorder you were suffering from, it's no longer detectable.  After a course of transfusions and antivirals it has rid your body of the virus that was invading it.  The scars on your face on your hands, on your feet, on your chest, they, they seem to be repairing themselves.  ",8,18
"SCULLY:      Mulder, you are in perfect health.  ",8,18
SCULLY:      Must feel good to be home.  ,8,18
SCULLY:      (a little embarrassed)   It's clean.  ,8,18
SCULLY:      Yeah.  She wasn't as lucky as you.  ,8,18
"SCULLY:      Mulder... I don't know if you'll ever understand what it was like.  First learning of your abduction... and then searching for you and finding you dead.  And now to have you back and, uh...  ",8,18
SCULLY:      I prayed a lot.  And my prayers have been answered.  ,8,18
SCULLY:      Yeah.  ,8,18
SCULLY:      Mulder...  ,8,18
"SCULLY:      No, I think Kersh wants you to quit, Mulder.  ",8,18
"SCULLY:      Well, I think the question is, Mulder, are we going to sit here and let this happen?  ",8,18
SCULLY:      I've had a partner for the last several months.  He was assigned to help me find you.  ,8,18
"SCULLY:      Agent Doggett is above reproach, Mulder.  He's being manoeuvred just like you.  ",8,18
SCULLY:      I can't reach him.  ,8,18
SCULLY:      I know.  And I'm all over it.  I will find him.  ,8,18
SCULLY:      I don't know if this is going to make you feel any better.  ,8,18
SCULLY:      (warning tone)   Mulder...  ,8,18
SCULLY:      What are you doing here?  ,8,18
"SCULLY:      Please, you do not want to stir that up right now.  ",8,18
SCULLY:       Yes... It does.  Why?  ,8,18
SCULLY:      He's right.  You're right.  ,8,18
SCULLY:      You think he knew something?  ,8,18
"SCULLY:      Mulder, you make it sound like this was a conspiracy.  ",8,18
"SCULLY:      Mulder, I know you know this, but if anything leaves this room you could be in violation of the law.  ",8,18
"SCULLY:      Mulder, just being here could be used by Kersh as cause for dismissal.  ",8,18
SCULLY:      I just don't know what you're hoping to find in Howard Salt's personal effects.  ,8,18
SCULLY:      So you'll risk the consequences even though there may be nothing here?  ,8,18
"SCULLY:      Mulder, you've been through an ordeal that defies all logical explanation. How can you think that these two men have the answers when they defy all standard of credibility?  ",8,18
"SCULLY:      Mulder, if you go down the X-Files will go down, too.  I mean, theoretically, they could put you in prison for what you're doing here.  ",8,18
SCULLY:      It's been encrypted.  ,8,18
SCULLY:      What are you doing?  ,8,18
SCULLY:      I'll book it for you.  ,8,18
"SCULLY:      So much for playing a hunch, Mulder.  The, uh, Gunmen were able to decrypt the data that you found on Howard Salt's hard drive.  It was a series of file directories that were downloaded the day that he died.  ",8,18
"SCULLY:      Fifteen minutes after Howard Salt was shot at the White House, firewalls went up on every data bank at that very facility.  ",8,18
SCULLY:      Agent Doggett?  ,8,18
SCULLY:      (to the CABBIE)   Could you wait minute?  ,8,18
SCULLY:      What are you doing here at is hour?  You're freezing cold.  ,8,18
SCULLY:      What do you have to give him?  ,8,18
"SCULLY:      Oh, yeah, Agent Mulder knows that already.  ",8,18
SCULLY:      Who gave you this information?  ,8,18
"SCULLY:      You have this, this password?  ",8,18
"SCULLY:      I'm, um... I'm not exactly sure I should tell you, Mulder.  ",8,18
"SCULLY:      (softly)   Oh, man.  ",8,18
SCULLY:      What are you doing here?  ,8,18
SCULLY:      He wouldn't listen to me.  ,8,18
SCULLY:      I can't do that to him.  ,8,18
SCULLY:      What?!  ,8,18
"SCULLY:      No.  You explain it to me now.  Set us up how, and with whom?  ",8,18
SCULLY:      Agent Doggett!  ,8,18
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Something's wrong.  ,8,18
SCULLY:   (on phone)    I think we've been set up.  You have to get Mulder out of there.  ,8,18
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    Get him out of there, Gunmen.  ",8,18
"SCULLY:    (on phone, worried)   What is happening, Byers?  ",8,18
"SCULLY: I'm not staying, Agent Doggett. My doctor told me to take my maternity leave. In fact, she insisted on it.  ",8,19
"SCULLY: It's a medallion commemorating the Apollo 11 space flight. I'd like to give this to you, Agent Doggett.  ",8,19
"SCULLY: Agent Mulder gave it to me a few years back. It symbolizes team-work, partnership. (DOGGETT looks at the reverse of the medallion. Inscribed are the words ""Commemorating Apollo 11 and it's mission to the moon. July 1969""). It means no-one gets there alone. And after this past year and everything that we've been through, it just, (pauses) I wouldn't be here without you.  ",8,19
SCULLY: Yeah. I'll just get my keys.  ,8,19
"SCULLY: How do you know all these things, Mulder?  ",8,19
SCULLY: Thank you for doing this with me.  ,8,19
"SCULLY: I don't know, I, uh, maybe it's hormones, or, I just, it's just, I'm just feeling so strange about all this.  ",8,19
"SCULLY: No, no, leaving work, I guess. I mean, I, I walked out of that office today feeling like a deserter.  ",8,19
"SCULLY: You know, the entire time that I was down there I had someone to watch my back.  ",8,19
SCULLY: Is it true?  ,8,19
SCULLY: I can't reach Agent Doggett and someone told me he's gone missing.  ,8,19
SCULLY: Why wasn't I told?  ,8,19
SCULLY: (on phone) I'm heading into the Bureau right now.  ,8,19
"SCULLY: Sir, are you ordering me not to go looking for Agent Doggett?  ",8,19
SCULLY: I know that you are. But what if it's not enough?  ,8,19
SCULLY: Thank you.  ,8,19
"SCULLY: What are you doing here, Mulder?  ",8,19
"SCULLY: I found something that may prove helpful in locating Agent Doggett. This is Arlen Sacks, the murder victim Doggett was investigating. This old man was not murdered, Mulder, he died of heart failure evidently after he was blinded by a chemical substance of some kind. The orbits have residual traces of a slimy substance, (She takes a swab and wipes the corpse's eye.) known as hydrolytic enzymes.  ",8,19
SCULLY: How do you know that.  ,8,19
"SCULLY: I, uh, I also found some bacteria in the venom which I am going to do a culture on.  ",8,19
"SCULLY: I know. But this is an X-File, Mulder, and you are out of the Bureau. If now I go home, where is Skinner going to find someone qualified to look into this.  ",8,19
"SCULLY: Mulder, what are you doing?  ",8,19
SCULLY: I just got off the phone with Skinner who is furious. This man Stites just called him saying you've been impersonating Deputy Director Kersh and making baseless accusations.  ,8,19
"SCULLY: Mulder, the victim had reptile venom in his eyes, are you now saying that it was a man who did this?  ",8,19
SCULLY: I know this may be hard to believe coming from me but some kind of reptile attack is the only explanation consistent with the scientific evidence.  ,8,19
SCULLY: Now why do you say that?  ,8,19
SCULLY: I'm sorry?  ,8,19
SCULLY: You found it?  ,8,19
SCULLY: I gotta go.  ,8,19
SCULLY: What am I looking at?  ,8,19
SCULLY: It looks like they're breaking down the tissue. (The computer screen zooms in on the culture.)  ,8,19
SCULLY: Digestive enzymes.  ,8,19
"SCULLY: So the reptile sprays its victim, then all it has to do is wait.  ",8,19
"SCULLY: Yeah, but there are no species that can do all of this. At least not yet.  ",8,19
"SCULLY: You were right about Herman Stites, Mulder.  ",8,19
"SCULLY: Well, Stites is a crypto-biologist, specialising in reptile genetics. Listen to this. It says here that he published a monograph last year claiming to be on the verge of creating a new species of reptile.  ",8,19
"SCULLY: I don't know. He dropped out of sight and never published a follow-up. But Mulder, the bacteria inside this venom - if Stites is genetically altering reptile breeds it may explain the peculiar properties.  ",8,19
"SCULLY: Mulder, are you listening to me?  ",8,19
SCULLY: Mulder? (Worried) Mulder?  ,8,19
SCULLY: Mulder! Mulder!  ,8,19
SCULLY: Agent Doggett.  ,8,19
SCULLY: No. No.  ,8,19
SCULLY: How is she?  ,8,19
SCULLY: Skinner said she won't be returning to the X-Files.  ,8,19
"SCULLY: Um, well, first of all, it was never (coughs) actually proven that it was a spaceship ...  ",8,19
"SCULLY: Well, no, what happened was that we fell off of something that ...  ",8,19
SCULLY:  ... that rose out of the ice.  ,8,19
"SCULLY: Well, I don't know what it was. But we never got, we didn't actually get to see a spaceship.  ",8,19
"SCULLY: Well, it couldn't have been a spaceship.  ",8,19
"SCULLY: Well, we don't know it was a spaceship. But you don't have a picture of it or anything.  ",8,19
"SCULLY: No, no, no, no, remember, I was unconscious and when I woke up there was no spaceship.  ",8,19
"SCULLY: Mulder, n-n-n-no.  ",8,19
"SCULLY: And you were frozen, and I hugged you .... (Their voices trail off.)  ",8,19
SCULLY:   Billy Miles shed his skin and literally became a new person.  ,8,20
SCULLY:   And I don't mean the same person.  (From Per Manum 8X08.  SCULLY meeting DUFFY HASKELL  in the X-Files office.)  ,8,20
"SCULLY:   Yes, I heard you, Mom-- for about the thousandth time, you can wait.  Didn't you have to wait with us?  ",8,20
"SCULLY:   Well, see, you obviously don't need me to tell you because you already know.  ",8,20
"SCULLY:   We told people noon, right?  ",8,20
"SCULLY:   (friendly, but uncomfortable)    Oh. Hi.  ",8,20
SCULLY:   (quietly)    Mom... what do we need help with?  ,8,20
"SCULLY:    Oh, Mom.  ",8,20
SCULLY:    This has got to be a conspiracy.  ,8,20
"SCULLY:   Thank you, but I would settle for one very healthy boy.  ",8,20
SCULLY:    Or girl.  ,8,20
"SCULLY:    Mmm, hmm-mm...  ",8,20
SCULLY:    Horse pills.  ,8,20
"SCULLY:    It is.  And, uh... I appreciate your help.  I didn't quite realize, uh... how much I needed it.  ",8,20
"SCULLY:    Hold still, Mulder.  This should just about do it.  ",8,20
SCULLY:    Sorry.  ,8,20
SCULLY:    Sorry.  ,8,20
SCULLY:    Who?  ,8,20
SCULLY:    Billy Miles?  He did this?  ,8,20
SCULLY:    What I want to know is what Billy Miles was doing at that medical office.  ,8,20
"SCULLY:    And what were you doing there,  (she gives him ""the look"") Mulder?  ",8,20
SCULLY:    To what?  ,8,20
SCULLY:    Mulder...  ,8,20
"SCULLY:    My baby is fine, Mulder.  I've had it checked over and over again with my new doctor that I trust implicitly.  ",8,20
"SCULLY:    Come on in, Lizzy.  It's all right.  We just need some space to talk.  ",8,20
SCULLY:    It's okay.  She's just helping me out here at my mother's insistence.  ,8,20
"SCULLY:    Lizzy, are you going to get that?  ",8,20
SCULLY:    Lizzy?  ,8,20
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Hello?  ,8,20
SCULLY:   (on phone)    Yeah. I just ran from the shower.  ,8,20
SCULLY:    (on phone)    What?  ,8,20
"SCULLY:   (on phone)    What...?  Mulder, what are you talking about?  ",8,20
SCULLY:    What are you doing?  What do you think you're doing with these?  ,8,20
SCULLY:    (furious)   Who are you?  Who are you?!  ,8,20

SCULLY:    Yes?  ,8,20

SCULLY:    Yes. My Mom just went to the...  ,8,20

"SCULLY:    From who?  Mulder, from what?  ",8,20
"SCULLY:    Look, Mulder, look, I can't take this!  I can't live like thisas, as the object of some unending X-File.  ",8,20
"SCULLY:    Mulder, lock your door.  ",8,20

SCULLY:      They want my baby. Why?  ,8,21
"SCULLY:      Oh, god.  I was hoping this was all a dream.  When did the sun come up?  ",8,21
SCULLY:      Where are we?  ,8,21
SCULLY:      Well under the circumstances...  ,8,21
"SCULLY:      Are you all right, Agent Reyes?  ",8,21
"SCULLY:      That's it, isn't it?  What you're really worried about?  ",8,21
"SCULLY:      Well, I've never had one.  That makes us both beginners.  ",8,21
"SCULLY:      Yeah.  Literally.  Anybody finds us out here, it really will be a miracle. Where exactly are we?  ",8,21
"SCULLY:      Really?  Well that's... comforting.  I guess.  (She doesn't sound comforted.) So, where do you want to set up?  ",8,21
SCULLY:      Any particular reason?  ,8,21
SCULLY:      I'm getting a feeling myself.  ,8,21
"SCULLY:      Well, there's no water from this rock.  We're going to need some water and a place to boil it.  Along with sterile supplies and a clean place to do this delivery.  ",8,21
SCULLY:      Okay.  ,8,21
"SCULLY:      Oh, my goodness.  Look at this.  Look at you.  Wow.  ",8,21
SCULLY:      Do we have matches?  ,8,21
SCULLY:      Yeah.  ,8,21
SCULLY:      Whale song?  ,8,21
"SCULLY:      No, no, it's not that.  Um, I was thinking that you reminded me of someone that I was close to-- my sister.  ",8,21
"SCULLY:      Uh, she was killed... about five years ago...  in my home.  (She sighs, and catches her breath.)  It was a terrible time.  ",8,21
"SCULLY:      Oh, it's, uh... It's okay.  Oh, thank you.  Thank you for, um... putting this together and... it's not what I planned but, um... it's very nice.  ",8,21
SCULLY:      What?  ,8,21
SCULLY:      I'm sure that this looks untoward but my life is in danger.  And my baby's. There's a man who's pursuing us and it is very important that he not find us here.  ,8,21
SCULLY:      This man...  he's extremely dangerous.  ,8,21
SCULLY:      Thank you.  ,8,21
SCULLY:      Thank you.  Thank you.  ,8,21
"SCULLY:      And what about what you're feeling?  Any vibrations, Agent Reyes?  ",8,21
SCULLY:      What?  ,8,21
SCULLY:      Who is it?  ,8,21
"SCULLY:      No, it's not okay.  What do you mean?  ",8,21
SCULLY:      They said that he couldn't be stopped!  ,8,21
"SCULLY:      No, you can't do that.  ",8,21
"SCULLY:      No, I mean, I, um... I just felt a contraction.  ",8,21
SCULLY:      That's great.  ,8,21
SCULLY:      Thank you.  ,8,21
SCULLY:      Thank you.  ,8,21
SCULLY:      Agent Reyes... what?  ,8,21
SCULLY:      What's happening?  ,8,21
SCULLY:      Agent Reyes!  ,8,21
SCULLY:      What's happening?!  What?  ,8,21
SCULLY:      What... What...  ,8,21
SCULLY:      (groaning in horror)   No!  ,8,21
SCULLY:      This is my baby!  ,8,21
SCULLY:      (begging pitifully)    Please don't let them take it!  ,8,21
SCULLY:      Please don't let this happen.  ,8,21
SCULLY:      It's mine!  ,8,21
SCULLY:      (pleading)   Please don't let them take it!  ,8,21
SCULLY:      We're doing just fine.  ,8,21
SCULLY:      William.  ,8,21
SCULLY:      After your father.  ,8,21
"SCULLY:      I don't understand, Mulder-- they came to take him from us-- why they didn't.  ",8,21
"SCULLY:      From the moment I became pregnant, I feared the truth... about how... and why.  And I know that you feared it, too.  ",8,21
SCULLY:      Which is what?  ,8,21
SCULLY: My baby is normal.  ,9,1
SCULLY: This is my baby! Please don't let them take it!  ,9,1
SCULLY: (To William) It's going to be okay ...  ,9,1
SCULLY: What? What's the matter?  ,9,1
"SCULLY: Yeah, the phone's off the hook because of the baby.  ",9,1
SCULLY: (after an uncomfortable pause) Come in.  ,9,1
SCULLY: I know.  ,9,1
SCULLY: He's gone.  ,9,1
SCULLY: He's just ... gone.  ,9,1
SCULLY: I don't know how to find him.  ,9,1
SCULLY: (voice from her bedroom) It makes sense in its own way. That's all I can tell you.  ,9,1
"SCULLY: Let it go, John. Drop it. Please.  ",9,1
"SCULLY: Exactly right, and they are unstoppable, and they are inside the FBI.  ",9,1
"SCULLY: I don't want to hear this. Look, there is nothing to any of this.  ",9,1
"SCULLY: (slowly, to stress what she's saying) My baby... my son... is fine.  ",9,1
SCULLY: I'm going to ask you to leave.  ,9,1
SCULLY: I'm going to ask you to leave and not come back here.  ,9,1
"SCULLY: Sleepy time, sweet William. See you in a couple of hours. (SCULLY is very gentle with him.)  ",9,1
"SCULLY: It's, er, Scully. (SCULLY'S voice sounds very worried. REYES picks up on this.)  ",9,1
SCULLY: Is Agent Doggett there?  ,9,1
"SCULLY: Yeah. Yeah, something. Um, I think I might have been wrong, telling you to drop your investigation.  ",9,1
SCULLY: What is it?  ,9,1
SCULLY: (Looking through some medical papers) And?  ,9,1
SCULLY: Who?  ,9,1
"SCULLY: (Examining some figures on the papers) Well, his blood alcohol level was up 0.15. He was drunk, he crashed and drowned.  ",9,1
SCULLY: Careful autopsy.  ,9,1
SCULLY: That's not what I'm saying.  ,9,1
"SCULLY: Water. Asphyxiation produced by the inhalation of water>. There are contusions on the forehead and on the chest but that isn't in fact hat killed him. (Conclusively) This man drowned. You're looking at me like you hope that there's something more, but there isn't.  ",9,1
"SCULLY: This is what I do, Agent Reyes.  ",9,1
"SCULLY: We can let our fears get the better of us. We can, uh, imagine things, make connections with things that aren't there. Like with this man.  ",9,1
SCULLY: (looking down at the table) There is something.  ,9,1
SCULLY: (Moving over to the body) Right here on the ankle.  ,9,1
"SCULLY: Yeah, that's what they look like.  ",9,1
"SCULLY: I don't know how, or who.  ",9,1
SCULLY: I need to get this body into refrigeration if you want to preserve it as evidence. Whatever he's evidence of ...  ,9,1
"SCULLY: Monica, I don't know what to say, but good luck. I gotta go. I gotta get home.  ",9,1
SCULLY: Third floor they have a cooler for the teaching cadavers. We could temporarily put him up there.  ,9,1
SCULLY: Who is she?  ,9,1
SCULLY: What's going on here?  ,9,1
SCULLY: I'm gonna go now. I've got a child at home.  ,9,1
SCULLY: Who is she?  ,9,2
SCULLY: My baby is fine.  ,9,2
SCULLY: I've just put him down.  ,9,2
SCULLY: What is it?  ,9,2
"SCULLY: (Looking away) Something happened, with my baby.  ",9,2
"SCULLY: I can't explain it. It's er, it's unexplainable, it's, um, not normal.  ",9,2
SCULLY: I need answers. I need to know. I can't just sit around wondering ...  ,9,2
SCULLY: Mulder can't know. He can't be brought back into this. He can't be brought back into the FBI. It's just too dangerous for him right now.  ,9,2
SCULLY: Hello?  ,9,2
SCULLY: I'm listening  ,9,2
SCULLY: Let's start with the water.  ,9,2
SCULLY: And what should they be asking?  ,9,2
"SCULLY: Look, I've had my fair share of outrageous conspiracy theories okay, so cut the mystery crap and get to the science.  ",9,2
"SCULLY: Chloramine is just a substitute for chlorine, you can drink it and it's harmless.  ",9,2
SCULLY: Who? And how?  ,9,2
"SCULLY: Alright then, why?  ",9,2
SCULLY: By adding something to our water?  ,9,2
SCULLY: What you're saying is absurd.  ,9,2
SCULLY: Huh (SCULLY gets up.) How can we trust any of this? Or you? What you say you are ...  ,9,2
"SCULLY: Nothing, nothing more than a small deformity of the spine. Physically, she seems absolutely normal, as normal as you or I.  ",9,2
SCULLY: What don't you believe Agent Doggett? I just examined her.  ,9,2
"SCULLY: Well for your sake, I hope so, but I hope not for mine.  ",9,2
"SCULLY: If this is true about this ship and this lab, there may be answers there I can't risk not knowing.  ",9,2
SCULLY: Somebody's already there.  (They see a figure over by the payphone in the distance.)  ,9,2
SCULLY: Sees us  ,9,2
SCULLY: Who is it?  ,9,2
SCULLY: This can't be right.  ,9,2
SCULLY: I think we found the Captain.  ,9,2
SCULLY: They're manipulating ova. (SCULLY walks further into the room.) Female eggs for transplantation.  ,9,2
SCULLY: Look at these names. These are test subjects.  (We see some kind of production line over SCULLY's head containing small clear bags of what look like test samples.)  ,9,2
SCULLY: Just give me a second.  ,9,2
"SCULLY: No let go, let me do this. I have to see if I'm here. My name, my baby's name -  ",9,2
SCULLY: (Softly) Everything's going to be okay. Go back to sleep.  ,9,2
SCULLY: Dr. Dana Scully. I have just been assigned to the Academy as a forensic investigator. For the past eight years I was part of a unit known as the X-Files. (There is muffled laughter.) Some of you may have heard of it.  ,9,3
"SCULLY: Sorry to disappoint you, but this is a course in forensic pathology. Hard science. An X-File is a case that has been deemed unsolvable by the Bureau, because such a case cannot be solved it may beg other explanations... a vampire, perhaps. Science, however, tells us that evil comes not from monsters, but from men. It offers us the methodology to catch these men, and only after we have exhausted these methods should we leave science behind to consider more (pause) extreme possibilities.  ",9,3
SCULLY: There is adhesive residue on Mrs. Mountjoy's wrists and face. (SCULLY uses a UV lamp to show REYES the residue.) Do you see that? She was taped and bound and then shot at a range of ten to twelve feet with her husband's handgun.  ,9,3
"SCULLY: Well, there's also evidence of fingerprint bruising along his collarbone.  ",9,3
"SCULLY: Snakes appeared to be purely symbolic. They're non-venomous species collected locally. They were sewn post-mortem into the body cavity with household thread, by someone who appears to have surgical skill.  ",9,3
SCULLY: But there's something else. There's something that you're not saying.  ,9,3
SCULLY: I've felt things that I couldn't understand. Things that I was afraid to admit even to myself.  ,9,3
SCULLY: I learned not to ignore it... to trust my instincts.  ,9,3
"SCULLY: It appears he was shot in the chest. His body was staged post-mortem, just like the others.  ",9,3
SCULLY: Saint Peter. He was said to have been crucified upside down.  ,9,3
"SCULLY: I haven't formed an opinion about it yet, actually.  ",9,3
"SCULLY: The syringes contained roperidol, that's the same anti-psychotic medication that she was giving to Dr. Richmond.  ",9,3
SCULLY: You still think that it was Kobold?  ,9,3
"SCULLY: Agent Doggett, have you considered that something else might be going on here?  ",9,3
"SCULLY: But I also said that once science fails, we have to consider extreme possibilities.  ",9,3
SCULLY: I know what you're feeling. I know your frustration. But you can't let it cloud your objectivity.  ,9,3
SCULLY: As far as I can tell physically he's fine.  ,9,3
SCULLY: What brought this on?  ,9,3
SCULLY: Agent Mulder used to refer to it as psychic plasma - a residual by-product of telepathic communication. In theory it would have inorganic properties that couldn't be explained otherwise.  ,9,3
"SCULLY: Well, then let's just see how well he plays that game.  ",9,3
SCULLY: Agent Doggett.  ,9,3
"SCULLY: Agent Reyes is just trying to get to the truth, okay? What are you doing?  ",9,3
SCULLY: Scully.  ,9,3
SCULLY: I'm on my way back to DC. What is it?  ,9,3
SCULLY: Where?  ,9,3
"SCULLY: On state road 710, near Annandale.  ",9,3
"SCULLY: There-there's old marina there. I passed it on my way home, in fact I'm almost there right now.  ",9,3
"SCULLY: Agent Doggett, over here.  ",9,3
SCULLY: He held me at gunpoint until you arrived and then he shot himself.  ,9,3
"SCULLY: Uncertainty. Not matter how thorough the investigation, some doubts inevitably remain. Just as juries seek to convict beyond reasonable doubt, the forensic investigator will seek conclusions supported by a preponderance of evidence. Rarely will you encounter a case where all of the variables, all of the open questions, are fully answered.  ",9,3
"SCULLY: (To herself, light-heartedly) I'll see you Monday.  ",9,3
SCULLY: (Sounding exhausted) I was going to do it on my way home.  ,9,3
SCULLY: But Agent Reyes told me that Kobold accessed information about all of us over the Internet. About Mulder too.  ,9,3
"SCULLY: He wanted us on the case, we know that.  ",9,3
"SCULLY: But we know all this already. It was a game, every move was played out perfectly. Except the last one.  ",9,3
"SCULLY: What, to get shot in the back?  ",9,3
SCULLY: Kobold's dead. Agent Doggett shot him. We all saw that.  ,9,3
SCULLY: Satan.  ,9,3
SCULLY: Chosen from the phone book. For what reason?  ,9,3
SCULLY: And the third victim?  ,9,3
SCULLY: (Moving closer) It's not Kobold.  ,9,3
SCULLY: Custer.  ,9,3
"SCULLY: Something still bothering you, Agent Reyes? You don't believe this explanation?  ",9,3
SCULLY: You mean that you felt the presence of evil?  ,9,3
SCULLY: Agent Doggett.  ,9,4
SCULLY: That was my question.  ,9,4
"SCULLY: Well, from what I could see from my visual exam the skin was removed with considerable skill by someone using a hunting-type knife. Arteries and veins were left intact so as to prolong the period that the victim would suffer.  ",9,4
SCULLY: Is there anything else ... Agent Reyes? Something special that brought this case to your attention as a possible X-File?  ,9,4
SCULLY: Most of these are post-mortem skinnings.  ,9,4
SCULLY: Wait a minute. What's this?  ,9,4
SCULLY: It's just ... there's a pattern. There's a pattern ... the way the skin's been stripped off. A match?  ,9,4
SCULLY: 1960.  ,9,4
SCULLY: Excuse me. Dr. Mueller?  ,9,4
SCULLY: Dr. Bertram Mueller?  ,9,4
SCULLY: My name is Dana Scully. I'm with the FBI. I want to ask you some questions about a John Doe you did an autopsy on in 1960.  ,9,4
"SCULLY: Sir, this particular victim was skinned alive.  ",9,4
"SCULLY: Sir, I haven't located police records from the investigation. Was there ever a suspect who was charged or arrested in this case as far as you know?  ",9,4
SCULLY: I don't understand.  ,9,4
SCULLY: And no one called him on that?  ,9,4
SCULLY: Why do you say that?  ,9,4
"SCULLY: If so, it's the most perfectly executed that I've ever seen. And why copy an obscure murder that nobody's ever even heard of?  ",9,4
SCULLY: I'm sorry?  ,9,4
"SCULLY: Agent Reyes, I got a call from Agent Doggett. He said there's another victim. (SCULLY notices that REYES is distressed.) Monica, you okay?  ",9,4
"SCULLY: Well, if you're up for it, I've got something to show you. Case files from crimes back in 1960.  ",9,4
SCULLY: More skinned bodies ... cut with the same precision as the body I examined.  ,9,4
"SCULLY: I need you to come to Quantico right away, Monica.  ",9,4
SCULLY: I have something to show you.  ,9,4
SCULLY: Agent Reyes.  ,9,4
"SCULLY: I showed you files of men killed in 1960 skinned alive like the current victims. Well, I had two of those bodies exhumed looking for crossover forensic details.  ",9,4
"SCULLY: Yes, there are cuts in the bone ... on the tibias and on the shoulder girdles that matched the cutting pattern that I found on Victor Potts ... using the exact same knife which left a signature pattern of grooves.  ",9,4
"SCULLY: Well, it's even weirder than that. (Both women leave the autopsy bay area and enter SCULLY's office. On her desk are various open old file folders.) I ran bios and backgrounds from the victims from 1960.  ",9,4
SCULLY: Mm-hmm. But look at the date that they died.  ,9,4
"SCULLY: Birth dates of Victor Potts and Terry Pruit. Potts and Pruit were born on the same dates that the previous victims died. You knew that we'd find something like this didn't you, Agent Reyes? How?  ",9,4
SCULLY: He's trying. We all are. It's just a long way to go from this... (holding the photograph) ... to this ... (indicating VAN ALLEN on life support beyond the glass window.)  ,9,4
SCULLY: You mean in a future life?  ,9,4
SCULLY: And Lisa Holland? What about her?  ,9,4
SCULLY: And you?  ,9,4
"SCULLY: Well, maybe in this life you succeed.  ",9,4
"SCULLY: Monica, I'm so sorry. Agent Doggett is just coming out of surgery and they're moving him to the ICU.  ",9,5
"SCULLY: If he pulls through this, it's likely that he'll be paralysed for life.  ",9,5
SCULLY: I saw something once. It's only been the last couple of years that I've... fully come to terms with it. In '94 my father passed away... and that night... at the very moment that it happened he came to me. I like to believe that he came to say goodbye.  ,9,5
SCULLY: (on phone) Scully.  ,9,5
"SCULLY: (on phone) Yeah, she's here, we're both at the hospital.  ",9,5
SCULLY: (on phone) What's this about?  ,9,5
SCULLY: What is this?  ,9,5
SCULLY: I'm going to put a stop to this.  ,9,5
SCULLY: Follmer's case has a couple potential holes.  ,9,5
"SCULLY: For starters, there's the fact that when I called you, you were at home. Fourteen miles from the crime scene.  ",9,5
SCULLY: Plus there's the condition of your gun.  ,9,5
"SCULLY: However, the bullet does match your gun. Perfectly.  ",9,5
SCULLY: I don't know. It could just be a muscle spasm. It's not uncommon with this type of spinal injury.  ,9,5
SCULLY: (reading) Lukesh.  ,9,5
SCULLY: Fully conscious. We set up a communication device designed for spinal injuries ............  ,9,5
"SCULLY: You all right, Agent Reyes?  ",9,5
SCULLY: It's understandable  ,9,5
SCULLY: Where's she gone?  ,9,5
SCULLY: He's in there. He's got to be.  ,9,5
SCULLY: And what if it is? Want to stick around to find out?  ,9,5
SCULLY: The message said urgent. What is it you want me to look at here?  ,9,6
"SCULLY: Well, I have to say that, uh... I've never seen anything quite like this before.  ",9,6
"SCULLY: Well, judging from the amount of insect faeces in the ear and nasal cavities it appears that they fed at such a furious rate that it caused the boy's skull to collapse from the inside. His helmet protected his head during the there is no impact trauma here whatsoever. None.  ",9,6
"SCULLY: I may have to brush up on my ""Spanish Fly"" but I don't think the science works that way. Anyway, before we start looking for M.O., I want to find out what kind of fly would act that aggressively.  ",9,6
SCULLY: Dr. Bronzino ...  ,9,6
SCULLY: These flies you mentioned neither of them are indigenous to North America. Are you suggesting that we've got a virulent foreign vector here?  ,9,6
SCULLY: I'm glad you're here. I think we just got our first real break.  ,9,6
"SCULLY: Well, it's what the entomologist Rocky Bronzino found. The flies that ate at the brain and skull of the victim are all female. Every last one of them.  ",9,6
"SCULLY: Well, what are the chances of that?  ",9,6
"SCULLY: Well, something biological is going on. Whether it's hormonal or chemical something has caused these bugs to attack.  ",9,6
SCULLY: To what?  ,9,6
SCULLY: Hmm. Lice are not altogether uncommon in a school environment.  ,9,6
SCULLY: So what are you saying? That this is just another dumb ass stunt?  ,9,6
SCULLY: How does one direct bugs?  ,9,6
SCULLY: Excuse me?  ,9,6
SCULLY: I'm aware of how pheromones work. But according to this device there isn't a single pheromone to be found out here.  ,9,6
SCULLY: Rocky.  ,9,6
SCULLY: So what do you suppose they're reacting to out here?  ,9,6
"SCULLY: Yeah, I tend to agree with that, yeah.  ",9,6
SCULLY: Fascinating.  ,9,6
"SCULLY: You know, Rocky ... I'm a mother.  ",9,6
SCULLY: What is it?  ,9,6
SCULLY: Where did you get this?  ,9,6
"SCULLY: I have to warn you, there's typically not a lot to be found in a teenage boy's sweaty kleenex.  ",9,6
"SCULLY: Yes, it's what causes B.O., But all too obviously it's not all that attractive--to anything.  ",9,6
SCULLY: Insect pheromone.  ,9,6
SCULLY: Rocky?  ,9,6
"SCULLY: Okay, so this boy's going through puberty, right? I mean, maybe his body chemistry is somehow just going crazy and it's his raging teenage hormones that are attracting all these insects.  ",9,6
"SCULLY: Yes, but against what?  ",9,6
SCULLY: Mrs. Lokensgard? Dylan?  ,9,6
"SCULLY: Well, I guess that's probable cause.  ",9,6
SCULLY: I have.  ,9,6
"SCULLY: I got upstairs, you take down.  ",9,6
SCULLY: Scully.  ,9,6
SCULLY: I'm with ROCKY at the Lokensgard's house. But there's nobody here.  ,9,6
SCULLY: How'd he do that?  ,9,6
"SCULLY: Yeah, Dylan's bedroom's up there. Unfortunately, he's not in it.  ",9,6
SCULLY: The kid's on a rampage.  ,9,6
"SCULLY: You got my number, partner.  ",9,6
SCULLY: Where are they?  ,9,6
SCULLY: Natalie!  ,9,6
"SCULLY (VOICE OVER): Four more bodies were found in the Lokensgard attic including that of Michael Lokensgard, Dylan's father, long reported missing.  ",9,6
"SCULLY (VOICE OVER): It now appears that he, like the others, fell victim to Dylan's mother who, in Dr. Rocky Bronzino's expert opinion, was neither human nor insect but something in between. A biological anomaly, whose differences from the rest of humanity could be hidden only for so long.  ",9,6
"SCULLY (VOICE OVER): However strong Dylan Lokensgard's yearning to fit in, to win acceptance, to love and to be loved he could not defeat the unseen forces which direct behaviour.  ",9,6
"SCULLY (VOICE OVER): In the struggle between our desire to determine who and what we will be and the identity which biology defines for us there can only be one outcome. But even in victory, there are forces biology can not defeat -- the stirring of the soul the mysteries of desire the simple truth that the heart wants ... what the heart wants.  ",9,6
"SCULLY: Well, this came in last night from US Customs. It's a blow-up from a security camera at the border crossing in Laredo, Texas. It was taken at 12:50 AM on the morning of the fourth.  ",9,7
SCULLY: Excuse me?  ,9,7
"SCULLY: Sir, he could be injured.  ",9,7
SCULLY: Monica.  ,9,7
"SCULLY: Surprise, surprise.  ",9,7
"SCULLY: Well, actually he doesn't know that I'm here. Nor does he know that Skinner is headed to Mexico to consult with the Federal Police.  ",9,7
"SCULLY: Perfect timing, I hope. Look what just got handed to me. (SCULLY shows the document to REYES.) This says that someone in Mexico is trying to track down a former Marine matching Doggett's description. It says that he was in an accident and possibly suffering from amnesia.  ",9,7
"SCULLY: Yeah, that's who placed the call. Does that sound familiar to you?  ",9,7
SCULLY: We'll trace the call.  ,9,7
"SCULLY: (Voiceover) One day, you'll ask me to speak of a truth - of the miracle of your birth. To explain what is unexplained. And if I falter or fail on this day, know there is an answer, my child, a sacred imperishable truth, but one you may never hope to find alone. Chance meeting your perfect other, your perfect opposite - your protector and endangeror. Chance embarking with this other on the greatest of journeys - - a search for truths fugitive and imponderable. If one day this chance may befall you, my son, do not fail or falter to seize it. The truths are out there. And if one day you should behold a miracle, as I have in you, you will learn the truth is not found in science, or on some unseen plane, but by looking into your own heart. And in that moment you will be blessed - and stricken. For the truest truths are what hold us together, or keep us painfully, desperately apart.  ",9,8
"SCULLY: Yes, thanks.  ",9,8
"SCULLY: And can I get a warm-up, please?  ",9,8
"SCULLY: (Voiceover) I've resisted contacting you for reasons I know you continue to appreciate. But, to be honest, some unexpected dimensions of my new life are eating away at any resolve I have left. I'm lonely, Dana, uncertain of my ability to live like this. I want to come home. To you, and to William.  ",9,8
"SCULLY: (Voiceover) I am physically shaking right now seeing your words. Wishing it were you speaking them to me. I want so badly to see you too, but you are still not safe here.  ",9,8
"SCULLY: The child's mother, she was just here. Where did she go?  ",9,8
SCULLY: What about Mulder?  ,9,8
"SCULLY: Well, who is he?  ",9,8
SCULLY: Files on what?  ,9,8
SCULLY: What does he want with Mulder?  ,9,8
"SCULLY: Well, even if this was a good idea I don't know how to contact him.  ",9,8
SCULLY: (To her class) I'm sorry about that. I believe that last class we were covering petechia and evidence of death by -  ,9,8
SCULLY: I'm trying to teach a class.  ,9,8
SCULLY: That's the operative word here - somebody. Somebody that we don't know.  ,9,8
SCULLY: (Insistent) What I don't want is Agent Mulder's life to be endangered any more than it already is.  ,9,8
"SCULLY: Do what, Agent Doggett?  ",9,8
"SCULLY: (To the WOMAN) Do you need help, ma'am?  ",9,8
SCULLY: Hey.  ,9,8
SCULLY: Do you need me to call the police?  ,9,8
SCULLY: Ma'am? Are you all right?  ,9,8
SCULLY: Come on in. The phone's over there.  ,9,8
"SCULLY: Well, you've (pausing) obviously got a problem. I saw you this morning at the cafe. Is he your husband?  ",9,8
SCULLY: It's okay. I understand. I mean ... it's hard enough caring for a child.  ,9,8
SCULLY: No. (SCULLY looks down.) But I wish I did.  ,9,8
SCULLY: Do you have anywhere to go?  ,9,8
"SCULLY: I'm going to get you a blanket and something hot to drink, all right?  ",9,8
SCULLY: (Extending her hand) My name's Dana.  ,9,8
SCULLY: (On phone) Hello.  ,9,8
SCULLY: Yeah. I just laid down. What time is it?  ,9,8
SCULLY: Put him down. Now!  ,9,8
SCULLY: Put my baby down.  ,9,8
"SCULLY: You staged this, didn't you? Arguing on the street. Everything.  ",9,8
SCULLY: It's a con job. What are you after? My baby?  ,9,8
"SCULLY: You got something to say, say it.  ",9,8
SCULLY: What does he want with Mulder?  ,9,8
SCULLY: (On phone) Hello.  ,9,8
SCULLY: Who is this?  ,9,8
SCULLY: You've been listening to us?  ,9,8
SCULLY: You ever heard of the Constitution?  ,9,8
SCULLY: What have they done?  ,9,8
"SCULLY: (Tearful) Well, you're going to have to tell me 'cause I don't know how to reach Agent Mulder.  ",9,8
SCULLY: (Tears are now welling up in her eyes) Look why should I trust you? You're just a voice on the end of the phone. I'm not going to give you anything unless I can meet you. Unless I ... unless I can see your face. Are you still there?  ,9,8
"SCULLY: I'm going to meet your contact. I think you should watch William, Monica.  ",9,8
"SCULLY: You said I had to trust someone, right? Well, that's what I'm doing.  ",9,8
SCULLY: (On phone) Hello.  ,9,8
SCULLY: Yes.  ,9,8
SCULLY: (on phone) I'm not sure I follow you.  ,9,8
SCULLY: (on phone) Yes.  ,9,8
"SCULLY: (on phone) All right, what next?  ",9,8
SCULLY: (on phone) Is it absolutely necessary to get innocent people hurt?  ,9,8
SCULLY: (on phone) So where am I going?  ,9,8
SCULLY: Where are you?  ,9,8
"SCULLY: Look, uh ... we're in the middle of nowhere.  ",9,8
SCULLY: This is ridiculous. This has gone far enough.  ,9,8
SCULLY: These clothes that I'm wearing ... they're my size. How the hell do you know my size?  ,9,8
"SCULLY: (Speechless) Oh, my God.  ",9,8
"SCULLY: Who authorizes you? I mean, what gives you the right? Who are you?!  ",9,8
"SCULLY: Well, then why do it? I mean, why meet me?  ",9,8
SCULLY: (To her students) Excuse me.  ,9,8
"SCULLY: I'm teaching a class, Agent Doggett. Is it something pressing?  ",9,8
SCULLY: You're right to be worried.  ,9,8
"SCULLY: That guy didn't come to me, Agent Doggett, he came to you. That woman that I took in blew his cover. He had no other choice.  ",9,8
SCULLY: I don't believe that. That woman is truly scared for her child for the same reasons that I am.  ,9,8
"SCULLY: 'Cause that couple doesn't even necessarily trust the Shadow Man. I mean, for their own reasons.  ",9,8
"SCULLY: Mulder and I already considered that even before he left. His return has been pre-arranged. The place, the mode of transport, everything's been set.  ",9,8
SCULLY: I can't. I've already sent for him. Mulder's on a train. He'll be here at midnight.  ,9,8
SCULLY: You can't do that to me.  ,9,8
SCULLY: (Passionately) I want to see him so bad.  ,9,8
"SCULLY: Well, it's too late. And I have to go.  ",9,8
SCULLY: Stop the train!  ,9,8
SCULLY: I'm a Federal Agent!  ,9,8
SCULLY: (Shouting) Mulder!  ,9,8
SCULLY: I know. I know that he was only trying to protect me.  ,9,8
SCULLY: I know. I'm sorry.  ,9,8
SCULLY: I'm so sorry.  ,9,8
"SCULLY: Agent Doggett, what?  ",9,8
SCULLY: Who?  ,9,8
"SCULLY: Well, where is he?  ",9,8
SCULLY: Mulder. I've got to warn Mulder.  ,9,8
SCULLY: Get on the radio! Get on the radio and alert them that there's a situation on that train.  ,9,8
"SCULLY: The man who fell on the tracks, he's gotten on that train.  ",9,8
SCULLY: Okay.  ,9,8
SCULLY: Mulder? Mulder?  ,9,8
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,9,8
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,9,8
SCULLY: Stop there! Stop right there! Why do you want to kill us?!  ,9,8
SCULLY: What are you talking about? What does this have to do with my son? What's wrong with my son?! Answer me!  ,9,8
SCULLY: (Voiceover) I hold no hope you can respond to this. Or that it reaches you. I only hope that you are alive.  ,9,8
"SCULLY: I have combed through every detail of this M.E.'s report. I have read and re-read it. And I am sorry, Agent Doggett, but the DNA fingerprinting does indeed exonerate this man.  ",9,9
"SCULLY: Actually, a hundred million.  ",9,9
"SCULLY: Agent Doggett, you don't... (sigh) It'd take at least 48 hours.  ",9,9
"SCULLY: Mr. Kailer, on the off chance that that's not true, what would be the harm in letting us look through your documents pertaining to this case? I mean, who knows. Maybe we can save the city some settlement money.  ",9,9
SCULLY: There's a lot of material here. Where should we start?  ,9,9
"SCULLY: ""Arresting Officer John Doggett."" Must have been a career maker.  ",9,9
"SCULLY: You know, John? (Pause.) Whatever we find here, sometimes... sometimes even good cops make mistakes.  ",9,9
SCULLY: That's not what I think. It's not. I just... I just worry that maybe this is about you feeling guilty.  ,9,9
SCULLY: Were you here all night?  ,9,9
SCULLY: Speaking of DNA.  ,9,9
"SCULLY: The re-tests of the typing confirm the original results, that the hair samples do, indeed, belong to someone other than Robert Fassl.  ",9,9
"SCULLY: John, there is something else. Something that explains why 13 years ago, the science of the day identified the hair as Fassl's. I spoke to the forensic examiner who ran the tests, and he found a match in 12 of the 13 key genes.  ",9,9
"SCULLY: It means that the mitochondrial DNA in the hair sample is genetically similar to Fassl's. In fact, it is remarkably similar. It is so similar that it must be from a blood relative.  ",9,9
SCULLY: I know.  ,9,9
"SCULLY: And yet, somehow it's true.  ",9,9
"SCULLY: No. Unfortunately, that's not gonna work. The 1989 evidence has to be thrown out.  ",9,9
"SCULLY: The hair samples logged to your crime scene, Agent Doggett, were not there on the day the crimes were committed.  ",9,9
"SCULLY: I am simply stating the facts, okay? The DNA evidence that was used to convict Bob Fassl... was planted.  ",9,9
SCULLY: Excuse me. Agent Doggett? A.D.A. Kailer. I assume you haven't seen him?  ,9,9
SCULLY: Apparently nobody has.  ,9,9
"SCULLY: Are you a Catholic, Bob? So am I. I remember times in my life when my Rosary was a great comfort to me. Comfort in times of tribulation. And watching you now, I get the feeling... that this is a tribulation for you.  ",9,9
"SCULLY: This man. Is it that he won't leave you alone, Bob? Is it that you just want him to go away? Tell us about him. Tell us so we can help make him go away.  ",9,9
SCULLY: As in he couldn't admit his own sins?  ,9,9
SCULLY: You mean water into wine?  ,9,9
"SCULLY: So what you're saying is because this man won't face himself, won't face his own sins, that he is forced to become someone else? (Pause) A killer.  ",9,9
SCULLY: It's better that you don't.  ,9,9
SCULLY: There are a lot of bodies in there.  ,9,9
SCULLY: There are many more victims than anyone ever knew.  ,9,9
"SCULLY: Ms. Fain, I think we'd better get you home.  ",9,9
"SCULLY: It appears to be a craft covered in symbols, which I now understand are part of a complex communication.  ",9,10
SCULLY (V.O.): They want my baby. Why?  ,9,10
"SCULLY (V.O.): I'm scared for you, Mulder, and for William ...  ",9,10
SCULLY: Agent Scully. He's expecting me.  ,9,10
"SCULLY: ""They""?  ",9,10
SCULLY: Sorry to keep you waiting.  ,9,10
SCULLY: May I ask what this is about?  ,9,10
SCULLY: Should I?  ,9,10
SCULLY: I'm not sure.  ,9,10
SCULLY: Am I under suspicion here?  ,9,10
SCULLY: And why is that?  ,9,10
"SCULLY: Well, if this is an X-File then why don't you ask somebody whos working on the X-Files?  ",9,10
SCULLY (to KERSH): Where did you get these?  ,9,10
SCULLY (still to KERSH): An illegal border crossing by whom?  ,9,10
SCULLY: I'd like to cooperate. I-I'd be happy to cooperate. I just wish that you would tell me who or what you are investigating.  ,9,10
SCULLY: Were you called about this? Has A.D. Follmer been down here?  ,9,10
SCULLY: Yeah. Going through the X-Files.  ,9,10
SCULLY: These.  ,9,10
SCULLY: Rubbings. Taken from the surface structure of a craft.  ,9,10
"SCULLY: A spacecraft. Agent Doggett, if you can wrap your brain around that.  ",9,10
"SCULLY: They were found by fishermen off the western coast of Africa. Two years ago, I traveled there to study it and I took these.  ",9,10
SCULLY: This morning I was called into the Deputy Director's office and I was shown an exact copy of that rubbing. I was asked by senior staff to identify it for them.  ,9,10
SCULLY: A guy running the North Dakota border from Canada. Or so they say.  ,9,10
SCULLY: Nothing.  ,9,10
SCULLY: That they're powerful.  ,9,10
"SCULLY: They're not just marks, Agent Doggett. It's writing. Words. Powerful words. And if the FBI has them and they're keeping their investigation of them a secret, then they have a sense of their power as well.  ",9,10
SCULLY: Hi.  ,9,10
"SCULLY: Well, what is it?  ",9,10
SCULLY: What little I read was through the help of an interpreter.  ,9,10
SCULLY: Yes.  ,9,10
SCULLY: Based on radiometric readings from fossils that were encrusted on the surface of the ship.  ,9,10
SCULLY: It'd mean that everything mankind believes in ... is in question.  ,9,10
"SCULLY: I didn't. I mean, I-I refused to believe it. But now I think ... I think there may be answers there.  ",9,10
SCULLY: Answers about my son. I know how that sounds. I have no one else to say it to. That I was meant to find these ... somehow. These were meant for me.  ,9,10
SCULLY: Those are questions I can't answer.  ,9,10
SCULLY (on phone): I'm on my way.  ,9,10
"SCULLY: That was Agent Doggett again. They're waiting. Mom, I've got to go.  ",9,10
"SCULLY: Mom, it's important. I wouldn't go if it weren't.  ",9,10
"SCULLY: Answers about William, mom.  ",9,10
"SCULLY: Mom, he's my child.  ",9,10
"SCULLY: Mom, I can't take this on faith. I need to know. I need to know if it's really God I have to thank.  ",9,10
SCULLY: Where did you get those?  ,9,10
SCULLY: Where's this cult supposed to be?  ,9,10
SCULLY: What did they think this guy was doing running across the U.S. Border carrying these rubbings on him?  ,9,10
SCULLY: That's it? That's the big secret?  ,9,10
SCULLY: I was questioned this morning by the senior staff of the FBI. Not about an FBI agent but about these rubbings. There's got to be something more. There has to be.  ,9,10
SCULLY: What are you talking about?  ,9,10
SCULLY: Wait a second. How can that be?  ,9,10
SCULLY: Mom?  ,9,10
SCULLY: No! No! Don't! Please! Don't!  ,9,10
SCULLY (frantically): I'll kill you! I'll kill you if you touch my baby!  ,9,10
"SCULLY: I need your help, okay?  ",9,10
"SCULLY: Agent Reyes, I need you to take my mom and the baby. Can you do that, Monica?  ",9,10
SCULLY: That man -- that FBI agent -- came here to kill my baby.  ,9,10
"SCULLY: No, not until he tells me why.  ",9,10
SCULLY (angry): I am not going to turn him over to the FBI! I am not gonna let them cover their tracks on this one!  ,9,10
SCULLY: Why?  ,9,10
SCULLY: Why do you want to hurt my son?!  ,9,10
"SCULLY: Agent Doggett, put down the phone! He has to answer me!  ",9,10
SCULLY: What? Say it!  ,9,10
SCULLY: Say it!!  ,9,10
SCULLY: Why?! Who told you that?!  ,9,10
SCULLY: He's my son! He's my son!!  ,9,10
SCULLY (whispers): A pillow.  ,9,10
SCULLY: This is just going to be another interrogation I prefer to stand.  ,9,10
SCULLY: Trying to kill my son.  ,9,10
SCULLY (angry): Another secret investigation or one where I'm given advance warning that my family's life is in danger?  ,9,10
SCULLY: And why wasn't I told? Why not Agent Doggett? Why not Agent Reyes? Why wasn't this an X-File?  ,9,10
SCULLY: What are you talking about?  ,9,10
"SCULLY: What threats? Threats to who? To me, to my child...  ",9,10
SCULLY: That's what this is about? Then why pull me in here and show me those rubbings? I don't understand.  ,9,10
"SCULLY (to WILLIAM): Hi, honey.  ",9,10
SCULLY (whispering to WILLIAM): It's okay.  ,9,10
SCULLY (whispering): It's Mulder ...  ,9,10
SCULLY: An artifact. I got it from the man who was trying to kill William.  ,9,10
SCULLY: It's a piece of the spacecraft.  ,9,10
SCULLY: I'll tell you on the way.  ,9,10
SCULLY: What is it?  ,9,10
SCULLY: The only ones left we can trust.  ,9,10
SCULLY: I need to know that you're taking him to a safe place. I need to know that you're ... that you're taking every precaution.  ,9,10
"SCULLY: Now, there's a good chance that my phone lines have been tapped and if they're tapped, they can trace you.  ",9,10
SCULLY (softly to WILLIAM): Hey ... it's going to be okay.  ,9,10
SCULLY: What's going on here?  ,9,10
SCULLY: My baby! They're after my baby! I have to get back!  ,9,10
SCULLY: I'll kill you if you touch my baby!  ,9,11
SCULLY: I need to know that you're taking him to a safe place.  ,9,11
SCULLY: I just had to see this for myself.  ,9,11
SCULLY: To what?  ,9,11
SCULLY: ... And A.D. Brad Follmer leading the charge.  ,9,11
SCULLY: I see a man who withholds information for Kersh. A man who not once but twice failed to prevent an attack on my son. You see a task force in there. I see a whitewash.  ,9,11
SCULLY: What is it going to take for you? How many people have to be taken out for you to open your eyes to it? My son ... Agent Doggett ... Mulder.  ,9,11
SCULLY: You call it protection. I call it a systematic effort inside the FBI to eliminate us.  ,9,11
SCULLY: To find my son.  ,9,11
SCULLY (from home): How's he doing?  ,9,11
"SCULLY: I need to see you right away, Monica. Are you alone right now?  ",9,11
SCULLY: I'd prefer if Skinner didn't know.  ,9,11
SCULLY: We found her.  ,9,11
SCULLY: The woman who took William.  ,9,11
"SCULLY: She's a wanted felon and a part of the UFO cult that the FBI was investigating. I need anything that you can find on her, Monica but I need you to get it quietly.  ",9,11
SCULLY: I asked them not to tell the FBI.  ,9,11
SCULLY: I'm trying to get my son back.  ,9,11
"SCULLY: Before William was kidnapped, Byers was able to tuck a cell phone under the padding of the baby's car seat.  ",9,11
SCULLY: Then I'll find him myself.  ,9,11
"SCULLY: Look, what alternative do I have ... when the FBI is all but telling me they think that my son is already dead?  ",9,11
SCULLY: You coming with me? Or am I going alone?  ,9,11
SCULLY: Federal Agent!  ,9,11
SCULLY: Just tell me where you got this.  ,9,11
"SCULLY: Robert Comer wrote this, didn't he? The FBI Agent who tried to kill my son, and how did you get it?  ",9,11
SCULLY: Take it.  ,9,11
"SCULLY: If I don't tell you you're good on your word, right? That means that you've learned absolutely nothing from me.  ",9,11
SCULLY: To the hospital.  ,9,11
"SCULLY: Look, this began when the Agent lying in that hospital crashed his motorcycle running the border from Canada. Somehow, he got to Washington without a scratch and he tried to kill my son. Now, tell me, how did he do that, Monica?  ",9,11
SCULLY: With something I found in his jacket pocket in a jacket that he wore to my house that I put three shots in.  ,9,11
SCULLY: Let go.  ,9,11
"SCULLY: Let go of my hand. (TO REYES:) Turn off the monitors, or they're going to alert somebody.  ",9,11
"SCULLY: Now, tell me who sent you to kill my son or I will take that pillow from under your head and make them the last breaths that you take.  ",9,11
SCULLY: Are you saying that god asked you to kill my child?  ,9,11
SCULLY: Then why does he want to kill him?  ,9,11
SCULLY: What he's saying is that Mulder is dead. That that's true. That they killed him to fulfil this prophesy.  ,9,11
SCULLY: This patient does not need support. He's breathing on his own.  ,9,11
SCULLY: What are we going to tell them?  ,9,11
SCULLY: The FBI about Agent Comer. About what just happened. About how he was healed.  ,9,11
SCULLY: They're not on our side. They will use the truth against us.  ,9,11
"SCULLY: How can you doubt him? I mean, after everything that you've just witnessed. After what you saw with my son.  ",9,11
"SCULLY (crying): I mean, it's-it's exactly what I feared. That there's something terribly wrong. From the very moment that he was conceived.  ",9,11
"SCULLY: I never meant for this. All that's been lost. I never meant to put you at risk -- to risk losing you, too. She's fighting for you. Monica's out there trying to find a way. And she's not going to let you go.  ",9,11
SCULLY: Agent Doggett. Oh ...  ,9,11
"SCULLY: Yeah, that was me. That was me talking to you.  ",9,11
SCULLY (to phone): Scully.  ,9,11
SCULLY: I came here to take him back.  ,9,11
"SCULLY: ""Ephesians.""  ",9,11
SCULLY: I want to see my son.  ,9,11
SCULLY: You killed Mulder.  ,9,11
SCULLY: You told me I could see my son. You lied.  ,9,11
"SCULLY (over phone): Get ready, Monica.  ",9,11
SCULLY: What about these hills? Are we going to lose him in these hills?  ,9,11
"SCULLY: Well, they have to get it back.  ",9,11
SCULLY: William?  ,9,11
SCULLY: William!  ,9,11
SCULLY: William!  ,9,11
SCULLY: No ...  ,9,11
"SCULLY: Oh, my god.  ",9,11
"SCULLY: Oh, my ...  ",9,11
SCULLY: William?  ,9,11
SCULLY:  After lunch. Sorry.  All questions answered after lunch.  Thank you.  ,9,12
SCULLY:  Leyla Harrison.  What a surprise.  ,9,12
"SCULLY:  Oh, uh... busy.  And yourself?  ",9,12
"SCULLY:  I have about five minutes uh, before my next class.  Can we talk while I eat?  ",9,12
SCULLY:  Where'd you get this?  ,9,12
SCULLY:  And what does that have to do with...?  ,9,12
SCULLY:  And what makes you think this is an X-File?  ,9,12
SCULLY:  ... and yet the coroner concludes that she stabbed herself to death.  ,9,12
SCULLY:  Agent Harrison I see no reason to disagree with the coroner.  ,9,12
"SCULLY:  Look, it is unusual but I have seen it before.  ",9,12
"SCULLY:  I'm sorry, Agent Harrison but unless you have other evidence ...  ",9,12
"SCULLY:  Uh, unless you bring me Spanky, there's nothing I can do.  ",9,12
SCULLY:  Apple and tuna salad?  ,9,12
SCULLY (to phone):  Hello.  ,9,12
SCULLY:  I was just putting the baby down.  What is it?  ,9,12
SCULLY:  Last name Conlon?  I assume you've been talking to Leyla Harrison?  ,9,12
SCULLY:  Who is it?  ,9,12
SCULLY:  Who?  ,9,12
SCULLY:  Do you know what time it is?  ,9,12
SCULLY:  Whoa.  What the hell is that?  ,9,12
SCULLY:  Come again?  ,9,12
SCULLY:  I am going to be exceptionally polite.  Leave.  Now.  Leave now and take that with you.  ,9,12
SCULLY:  I don't care.  Leave!  Now! Please!  ,9,12
SCULLY:  If only.  God help me but Agent Harrison might be on to something after all.  ,9,12
"SCULLY:  Will you keep your voice down, please?  You're going to wake my baby.  ",9,12
SCULLY:  Because it would seem that poor Spanky here may have chewed a hole in his own stomach ... which you'll admit is unusual behaviour.  ,9,12
"SCULLY:  Just like his owner, Mrs. Conlon stabbed herself with a knife.  The wounds are in the same place and if we figure out why ... well, then, you'll have something really good to share with your good friend Leyla Harrison, won't you?  ",9,12
"SCULLY:  Can you hold the ribs open while I grab that, please?  Just... Now. Thank you.  ",9,12
SCULLY:  Agent Scully.  ,9,12
"SCULLY:  Hi, Sheriff.  Thanks for getting back to me.  I appreciate it.  I'm an FBI agent and I've been trying to reach three of my colleagues that are up in your area.  ",9,12
"SCULLY:  Well, they're looking into some concerns expressed by the grandmother of a child.  The family name is Conlon and I have an address ...  ",9,12
SCULLY:  Over what?  ,9,12
"SCULLY:  Well, as I say, sheriff, I need to contact my colleagues.  ",9,12
"SCULLY:  Look, sheriff, they may be in danger.  Could you please find a way?  ",9,12
"SCULLY:  This Sheriff, Jack Coogan, I'm just getting his answering machine.  ",9,12
"SCULLY:  No, there wasn't.  But it certainly seems like there should have been.  ",9,12
"SCULLY:  Well, the pattern of bite marks.  I mean, it seems to me that the cat was trying to get at something in its stomach to chew something out.  ",9,12
"SCULLY:  I don't know.  I mean, there wasn't any sign of it but it obviously caused a great deal of pain.  And I'm thinking maybe it goes the same for the woman who tried to stab herself.  I mean, what if that was a frantic attempt to... to cut something out.  ",9,12
SCULLY:  All I know is we're wasting our time talking about this.  ,9,12
SCULLY:  My mom.  I'm going to beg her to baby-sit.  ,9,12
SCULLY:  Sheriff Coogan?  Sheriff?  ,9,12
"SCULLY:  Yeah.  I, uh, I still can't contact my partners.  Were you able to get up there?  ",9,12
"SCULLY:  Well, Sheriff, there are three FBI agents who may be in grave danger.  ",9,12
"SCULLY:  Well, we have to get up there.  I mean, there must be a way.  ",9,12
SCULLY (to JEFF CONLON):  I'm a medical doctor.  ,9,12
SCULLY:  Speak of the devil.  ,9,12
"SCULLY:  So, any news on the boy?  ",9,12
SCULLY (Voiceover):  What's that?  ,9,12
"SCULLY: Well, the man who hit her had fifteen. Don't do this to yourself, John.  ",9,13
"SCULLY: It's true, John. She's gone.  ",9,13
"SCULLY: There's no measurable electrical activity in her brain. Brain death is ... indeed death, John.  ",9,13
SCULLY: I'm sorry.  ,9,13
SCULLY: John ...  ,9,13
"SCULLY: John, at the end of the day it doesn't matter. It doesn't change the diagnosis or her prognosis.  ",9,13
SCULLY: I did note some minor swelling in the left anterior which is consistent with subdural haematoma.  ,9,13
SCULLY: I-I don't know if that means anything. It's not like there's an exact formula for how much damage equals death.  ,9,13
SCULLY: Yeah. She had EEG monitoring after the point that she coded.  ,9,13
SCULLY: Agent Doggett.  ,9,13
SCULLY: What exactly are you thinking?  ,9,13
SCULLY: You're thinking that somebody murdered her to cover something up.  ,9,13
"SCULLY: Well, I'd use a fast-acting barbiturate like pentobarbital. I'd use a small-bore needle to make it next to impossible to find an injection mark.  ",9,13
SCULLY: Agent Doggett ... I'm happy to do this for you. Just don't kid yourself that this is going to somehow bring her back.  ,9,13
SCULLY: I'll call you back.  ,9,13
SCULLY: Monica's parents are on their way from Mexico City. They're coming to say good-bye.  ,9,13
SCULLY: What are these?  ,9,13
SCULLY: Dr. Jack Preijers.  ,9,13
"SCULLY: Well, at the request of the family.  ",9,13
SCULLY: How did you come up with these two men's names?  ,9,13
SCULLY: The transplant teams are in place.  ,9,13
SCULLY: John ... I'm still waiting for your argument. If you have something to convince me to convince the doctors that somehow she's alive.  ,9,13
SCULLY: Agent Reyes?  ,9,14
SCULLY: What are you doing?  ,9,14
SCULLY: Why would I think that you're crazy?  ,9,14
SCULLY: No.  ,9,14
SCULLY: Because I don't think that its complexity allows for it to be reduced so simply.  ,9,14
"SCULLY: I presume you mean the so-called Unified Theory, what physicists often refer to as the theory of everything. An equation so simple they say that it might be printed on a T-shirt. It's a holy grail in the world of science. Potentially the most important question that mankind has ever asked. But that such a complex calculation is even possible is a subject of enormous controversy. Is that what you mean?  ",9,14
"SCULLY: Agent Reyes, if there's a connection that I'm supposed to be seeing, I'm not seeing it.  ",9,14
"SCULLY: Agent Reyes, am I to presume that you've solved these unsolved murders by using some kind of numerical calculation?  ",9,14
"SCULLY: Numerology, Agent Reyes... You're trying to solve these cases by using what is essentially a child's game.  ",9,14
"SCULLY: And, uh, when exactly did you stumble upon it?  ",9,14
"SCULLY: So in other words, you haven't actually solved these cases.  ",9,14
"SCULLY: Without any other evidence to directly connect them, circumstantial or forensic.  ",9,14
SCULLY: Can you enlarge this? (REYES zooms in on the photo.) Can I see the rest of those photos?  ,9,14
SCULLY: There's a pattern in the bruising. All four of the victims have it. Three small circles. It might be from a ring that the killer wears.  ,9,14
SCULLY: Or that maybe you're both crazy.  ,9,14
SCULLY: The killer is strong. He uses his fists as weapons. Brute force. He is angry and he acts on impulse.  ,9,14
"SCULLY: The deceased is Vicki Louise Burdick. Upon external examination, cause of death appears to be a fatal blow to the maxilla, in which a small three-ring pattern lies. I will begin my internal examination at six-oh-six PM  ",9,14
SCULLY: I've got something to show you.  ,9,14
"SCULLY: I figured out what the triple zero pattern on the victim is. They aren't zeroes at all. It's the number 6-6-6, only worn away. (SCULYL shows REYES an enhanced photo of AMY'S face.) It must be stamped on the killer's ring. 6-6- 6, the work of the devil.  ",9,14
SCULLY: I didn't.  ,9,14
SCULLY: Completely by accident.  ,9,14
SCULLY: Uh... And how did the killer find her?  ,9,14
SCULLY: And how does that help us find the killer?  ,9,14
"SCULLY: Despite what we know about the victim's numerology, about the ring that we think that he wears, we really know next to nothing about where to start looking for this man.  ",9,14
SCULLY: You going down?  ,9,14
SCULLY: Thank you.  ,9,14
SCULLY: Get out of the elevator!! Move!!  ,9,14
SCULLY: It's him.  ,9,14
SCULLY: Stairs.  ,9,14
SCULLY: Great.  ,9,14
SCULLY: We have to get an APB out on that car. Did you happen to see a plate?  ,9,14
SCULLY: We've got all the numbers on this case except for the ones we need.  ,9,14
SCULLY: Well it's only midnight. There's gotta be somebody coming in or out soon.  ,9,14
"SCULLY: We're Federal Agents and we're armed! If you are here, and you make any sudden moves, we will be forced to consider you a threat.  ",9,14
SCULLY: Stay where you are! Right there!  ,9,14
SCULLY: Step out around the back of the car.  ,9,14
SCULLY: I want you to show us some identification.  ,9,14
"SCULLY: Sir, what are you doing here?  ",9,14
"SCULLY: At midnight, in a parking garage?  ",9,14
"SCULLY: Sir, does it look like we're here to play checkers?  ",9,14
SCULLY: All right. Let's pop the trunk.  ,9,14
SCULLY: What's all this?  ,9,14
"SCULLY: Sir, enough.  ",9,14
SCULLY: What time is your friend coming?  ,9,14
SCULLY: I don't know. I don't know.  ,9,14
"SCULLY: We happen to be here, Sir, because there is a serial killer on the loose.  ",9,14
"SCULLY: We're not, stuck down here.  ",9,14
SCULLY: Do you have the combination to the door?  ,9,14
SCULLY: (to Reyes) How did we get ourselves into this?  ,9,14
SCULLY: Agent Reyes?  ,9,14
SCULLY: I don't believe it.  ,9,14
SCULLY: Who are you?  ,9,14
SCULLY: You're part of this.  ,9,14
SCULLY: Keep your hands up.  ,9,14
SCULLY: I don't know.  ,9,14
SCULLY: Will you just...  ,9,14
"SCULLY: No, that's... that's not what she means. (sigh) She thinks that his acts are determined by a calculation of numbers.  ",9,14
SCULLY: No. It's not.  ,9,14
SCULLY: Agent Reyes. You can't reduce a complex factor as physical and psychological into a game.  ,9,14
"SCULLY: Agent Reyes, that is utter nonsense, okay? It would mean that all we are are checkers on a checker board being moved around by some ... forces completely outside and unbeknownst to us.  ",9,14
"SCULLY: Nor does he play checkers. (SCULLY looks happy with her retort) Look, Agent Reyes, you can't reduce all of life, all creation, every piece of ... of art, architecture, music, literature... into a game of win or lose.  ",9,14
"SCULLY: But the killer is outside, killing, and we are stuck in a parking garage.  ",9,14
SCULLY: What are you lookin' at?  ,9,14
SCULLY: You go left and I'll go right. (to Mr. BURT) You? You stay right where you are.  ,9,14
SCULLY: He's going fast.  ,9,14
SCULLY: Can you hear me?  ,9,14
SCULLY: (to Doggett) How did you ever find us?  ,9,14
SCULLY: (into phone) All right. I need to know.  ,9,14
SCULLY: (into phone) What my numerology is. My number. Whatever you call it. What am I?  ,9,14
SCULLY: (into phone) Which means what?  ,9,14
SCULLY: (into phone) There's something else that's buggin' me.  ,9,14
SCULLY: (into phone) Who was that man?  ,9,14
"SCULLY: I'll catch up. (SKINNER heads off, following REYES and DOGGETT.) They meant so much to me. I'm not sure if they ever really knew.  ",9,15
"SCULLY: It means that, like everyone buried here, the world is a better place for them having been in it. (She pauses.) It means that they're gone... but they live on through us all.  ",9,15
"SCULLY: Jane Doe. Found last night entombed in a tenement wall by an agent who was following an anonymous tip. Time of death, approximately 2100 hours from three stab wounds to the abdomen. Dirt and clay were found under the nails of her right hand.  ",9,16
SCULLY: Predation-- from rats. The agent was led to her body by the sound of their feeding. Anyone?  ,9,16
SCULLY: That's possible. What else would help us I.D. This victim -- find the killer?  ,9,16
SCULLY: What is?  ,9,16
SCULLY: Point zero four.  ,9,16
SCULLY: And you know that because ...  ,9,16
SCULLY (on phone): Great; thank you.  ,9,16
"SCULLY: Quite a lot, actually. We've identified your Jane Doe as Ellen Persich, 28, from Redland, Maryland.  ",9,16
SCULLY: The bar that she was at last night is about a half a mile from where another woman was murdered two weeks ago apparently by the same killer.  ,9,16
"SCULLY: That's why I didn't make the connection at first, either but that was the lab on the phone and they confirmed that it was the same knife in both killings.  ",9,16
SCULLY: I didn't but one of my students realized that the killer only meant to stab Agent Doggett's victim once. The other wounds were out of anger because he missed.  ,9,16
SCULLY: Amazingly so.  ,9,16
SCULLY: Like what?  ,9,16
"SCULLY: I don't know, Agent Doggett, but now that you've got this case I'd say run with it.  ",9,16
SCULLY: Hi. I'm Dana. Nice to meet you.  ,9,16
SCULLY: You weren't able to make an identification?  ,9,16
SCULLY: He blames himself.  ,9,16
"SCULLY: As you asked, I compared the wounds inflicted on your son with the wounds on these two women.  ",9,16
SCULLY: There are similarities between the trajectory of the wounds and the force with which they were delivered.  ,9,16
"SCULLY: Meaning that it was a brilliant forensic deduction on Cadet Hayes's part. But that's all it is. The killer used different weapons, he demonstrated no consistent M.O, and no clear victimology.  ",9,16
SCULLY: It's all in there. How you defrauded the FBI with a false identity in order to gain admittance to the Academy. We know who you really are. We know about your history with schizophrenia. We know that you orchestrated this entire thing in order to get close to Agent Doggett.  ,9,16
SCULLY: Because Nicholas Regali did not kill Agent Doggett's son. You did.  ,9,16
"SCULLY: And then, you killed Agent Doggett's son.  ",9,16
"SCULLY: Well, he told us his story. Whether it's true ...  ",9,16
SCULLY (singing softly):  William was a bullfrog.  ... was a good friend of mine.  ...  never understood a single word he said ...  ,9,17
SCULLY (singing):  ...and it must have been some mighty fine wine.  ... joy to the world.  All the boys and girls.  Joy to the fishes ...  ,9,17
"SCULLY (singing):  ...in the deep blue sea.  Joy to you and me.  If I were the king of the world,  I tell you what I'd do ...  ",9,17
SCULLY:  Agent Reyes.  ,9,17
SCULLY:  Do we know who he is?  ,9,17
SCULLY:  Why are the lights off?  ,9,17
SCULLY:  What do you mean?  ,9,17
SCULLY:  And he says he knows me?  ,9,17
SCULLY:  How did he get in the building?  ,9,17
SCULLY:  His name is Miller?  ,9,17
SCULLY:  What are you doing here?  ,9,17
SCULLY:  Answers to what?  ,9,17
"SCULLY:  From your scarring, it appears that you've been burned.  Are you claiming that someone burned you and that there is evidence here to incriminate them?  ",9,17
SCULLY:  Go on.  ,9,17
"SCULLY:  Did Mulder tell you that, too?  ",9,17
SCULLY:  When?  ,9,17
SCULLY:  That's his sister.  ,9,17
"SCULLY:  You seem to know a lot, Mr. Miller.  It gives an impression either that you are telling the truth or you just want us to believe that you are.  ",9,17
SCULLY:  Agent Doggett. Would you please arrange the transfer of this man to Quantico?  I'd like to personally examine his injuries.  ,9,17
"SCULLY:  from the tissue quality, the scarring is fairly recent ... the extent of it severe but it's not from burning or chemicals.  ",9,17
"SCULLY:  What is it, then?  ",9,17
SCULLY:  Injected with what?  ,9,17
"SCULLY:  What is it, Agent Doggett?  ",9,17
"SCULLY:  Well, who is he?  ",9,17
SCULLY:  He said that he contacted Agent Mulder -- that Mulder told him...  ,9,17
SCULLY:  That's ridiculous.  It's absurd.  ,9,17
"SCULLY:  I'm telling you, that's not Mulder.  ",9,17
"SCULLY:  (softly)  Can you open your mouth, sir?  I need to look at your dental work.  ",9,17
SCULLY:  Now your eyes.  ,9,17
SCULLY:  Are you going I don't know how I can.  ,9,17
"SCULLY:  You, uh... refer to them as if I know them or know where they are.  ",9,17
"SCULLY:  Sir, you've given us a false name.  We know that your name is not Daniel Miller.  ",9,17
SCULLY:  What is it?  ,9,17
"SCULLY:  Why lie to us, if you want us to help you?  ",9,17
SCULLY:  You can put your clothes back on.  ,9,17
SCULLY:  How can you help me?  ,9,17
SCULLY:  It's not him.  It's not Mulder.  ,9,17
SCULLY:  Yes.  And so will we all be once you bring me back his DNA tests.  ,9,17
"SCULLY:  Well, admittedly he's lying about who he is but the danger to him may be real.  I think we need to figure out what it is that he wants and then see if he lies about that, too.  ",9,17
"SCULLY:  Well, first, I think we need to quietly get him back to D.C.  To FBI headquarters.  ",9,17
SCULLY:  You came here looking for something.  What is it that you hope to find?  ,9,17
SCULLY:  And what does this have to do with you?  ,9,17
SCULLY:  Yes.  ,9,17
SCULLY:  This is what you're looking for.  ,9,17
SCULLY:  Proving Agent Doggett wrong.  That that's not Mulder in there.  ,9,17
SCULLY:  Mulder and I agreed to take those files out of the X-Files office and leave them here for safekeeping.  Mulder would have known where they were.  And that man in there didn't.  ,9,17
SCULLY:  What are you doing?!  ,9,17
SCULLY:  Get away from the crib!  ,9,17
SCULLY:  It's none of your business!  ,9,17
"SCULLY:  Well, if that's true, then where the hell is he?  ",9,17
SCULLY:  Just tell me where he is!  ,9,17
SCULLY:  I have to know.  ,9,17
SCULLY:  Then let me go to him.  ,9,17
SCULLY:  That's not for you to decide.  ,9,17
SCULLY:  It's all been a good act.  ,9,17
SCULLY:  I think you do.  You knew those files were here. You just pretended not to know.  ,9,17
SCULLY:  I want the truth from you.  ,9,17
SCULLY:  The truth that you won't speak.  ,9,17
SCULLY:  (begging)  Don't do this to me.  Not you.  ,9,17
SCULLY:  How do you know my life?  ,9,17
SCULLY:  What are you saying?  ,9,17
"SCULLY:  Just tell me who you are.  Come on, just say your name.  Say it! Just say it!  ",9,17
SCULLY (to REYES):  Could you please leave?  And close the door?  ,9,17
SCULLY:  This was a private conversation.  ,9,17
SCULLY:  Do you know who that man is?  ,9,17
SCULLY:  What is this?  What?  ,9,17
SCULLY:  It's not him.  He wouldn't say these things.  ,9,17
SCULLY:  It's not him.  ,9,17
"SCULLY:  No, thank you.  I just need a minute.  ",9,17
"SCULLY:  So, what now?  ",9,17
SCULLY:  What do you want to do?  ,9,17
"SCULLY:  Well, that's not going to be hard.  ",9,17
SCULLY:  Nobody's ever going to believe that that's Mulder.  ,9,17
"SCULLY:  If he's so afraid, then why did he run?  ",9,17
SCULLY:  You know a person in so many ways.  Ways that a test can't even begin to know.  ,9,17
"SCULLY:  If that was Mulder, I wouldn't care.  ",9,17
SCULLY:  You believe that?  ,9,17
SCULLY:  it's okay.  ,9,17
"SCULLY:  Oh, my god, there's blood!  Oh, my god!  ",9,17
SCULLY:  What'd he do?  What'd he do to him?!  ,9,17
SCULLY:  Where's Dr. Edwards?  ,9,17
SCULLY:  He's been injected with something.  ,9,17
SCULLY:  I've no idea. I don't know.  I don't know.  ,9,17
"SCULLY:  I'm a medical doctor, okay?  Can I ...  ",9,17
SCULLY:  How is he?  Is he all right?  ,9,17
"SCULLY (smiling):  Oh, god.  ",9,17
SCULLY:  What did you find?  ,9,17
SCULLY:  No ... I think it does.  It makes perfect sense now.  ,9,17
"SCULLY:  I have seen my share of the hideous of the disgusting and the repellent, but you, sir, are the most perfect expression I will ever see of all that is vile and hateful in life.  ",9,17
SCULLY:  I never believed it.  ,9,17
SCULLY:  You are as false as your face.  ,9,17
SCULLY:  I bet you wish night and day that that bullet that was meant to kill you had succeeded.  ,9,17
"SCULLY:  Your cigarette-smoking, son of a bitch of a father.  ",9,17
SCULLY:  You counted on the DNA ... that we'd buy it without question and not look any further.  DNA's what Mulder shared with Jeffrey Spender.  ,9,17
"SCULLY:  You haven't seen Mulder, have you?  You haven't even talked to him.  So, getting caught at the FBI ... winning our trust was all towards one thing.  It was only to get to William.  ",9,17
SCULLY:  I had this checked.  It's an unknown metal that you injected into my son.  ,9,17
"SCULLY:  ""A gift""?  ",9,17
"SCULLY:  So, what, you've prevented it now?  You've ... prevented alien colonization by injecting this metal into my son?  ",9,17
"SCULLY:  So, he's all right now?  I mean, just like that?  ",9,17
"SCULLY:  So, it's over.  They'll let him be.  ",9,17
"SCULLY:  Well, I can protect him.  ",9,17
SCULLY:  Thank you.  ,9,17
SCULLY:  And how should I prove it now?  By insisting that I can protect him ... only to learn too late that I can't?  ,9,17
SCULLY:  He didn't have a choice to come into this life.  I don't have a choice about what he is or was ... but I do have a choice about the life my son will have ...  ,9,17
SCULLY:  ... And shouldn't I choose that he never have to be afraid of anyone or anything?  And can I ever really even promise him that?  ,9,17
"SCULLY: (Into microphone) Case number 1-4- dash-3-0-8, Blake McCormick. A well nourished Caucasian male, 24-years-old. I will begin with my external examination. (She walks around the body, noticing a large amount of grey material stuck in BLAKE'S head.) And here is a likely place to start.  ",9,18
SCULLY: Ahhhh!  ,9,18
"SCULLY: Well for starters, Mr. McCormick was dead before he landed on the car. His skull was pulverized from a previous impact. And judging by the roofing material that I found in the wound, I'd say that Agent Doggett's theory holds water.  ",9,18
SCULLY: Electricity.  ,9,18
"SCULLY: Or maybe electricity is only a by-product. I'm... I'm not really sure. But... look, I had an odd experience today. And, uh, and it made me think to try something unusual. I borrowed an EEG machine, and I wired Mr. McCormick to it. And for the last few hours, he's been putting off a faint reading.  ",9,18
"SCULLY: No. He's dead as a hammer. Uh... what I'm reading is some sort of residual electricity, like a... like a battery that's draining off its charge. (A monitor shows a faint reading.) It's fascinating. I mean, I've never seen anything quite like it.  ",9,18
"SCULLY: Well, if Mulder were here, I'd, uh, imagine he'd talk about research linking electromagnetic fluctuations to levitation, poltergeist activity, ghost sightings ...  ",9,18
"SCULLY: At the end of the day, I wouldn't have any theory that was any better. And I don't now.  ",9,18
"SCULLY: So, the owner won't talk, huh?  ",9,18
SCULLY: (to DOGGETT) Smile. You're on TV.  ,9,18
SCULLY: I'm in Los Angeles at the Field Office. I've called in someone whom you'll both want to meet.  ,9,18
"SCULLY: I went through Mulder's reference books. Van Nuys, California, 1970, one of the best documented cases of what was initially thought to be poltergeist activity. It focused on a young. boy, Anthony Fogelman, who has since changed his name. And Doctor Reits was the parapsychologist who investigated it.  ",9,18
SCULLY: He was psychokinetic.  ,9,18
SCULLY: He lost his power?  ,9,18
"SCULLY: A jinx. Cousin Oliver, the Jinx. (SCULLY tries to explain her knowledge of the show.) Oh, so maybe I watched an episode or two. Uh... so what you're saying is that, uh, his choice speaks to Anthony Fogelman's character. How he views himself. Um, unlucky, star-crossed, a danger.  ",9,18
"SCULLY: Well, I'm starting to hope that it doesn't come to that.  ",9,18
"SCULLY: Well, the power that this man seemingly possesses is extraordinary. It needs to be studied.  ",9,18
"SCULLY: It very well could. I mean, I've... I've been working this unit for nine years now. I-I've investigated nearly 200 paranormal cases. We are due for some incontrovertible proof. I want vindication, for ... for Mulder and ... for all of us.  ",9,18
SCULLY: Just minor bruising.  ,9,18
SCULLY: Oliver. It's a great pleasure to meet you.  ,9,18
SCULLY: Can you think about other things? (Pause) What happens if you think about another place? A nice place?  ,9,18
"SCULLY: Oh, my god.  ",9,18
"SCULLY: Oliver? With your help, we could learn so much. I would love to take you back with us to Washington.  ",9,18
"SCULLY: Well, I think that's where we can help him. I mean, he needs to learn how to control his powers. I mean, my God. There's no end to what he could accomplish.  ",9,18
"SCULLY: And besides, I mean... as grand as this may sound, we owe it to the world.  ",9,18
"SCULLY: So, what do you think, Dr. Jaycocks?  ",9,18
SCULLY: He's having a seizure. What happened?  ,9,18
SCULLY: Oliver's electrolytes were severely imbalanced. That's what sent him into shock. They've stabilized his fluids.  ,9,18
"SCULLY: Well, there's other problems. His thyroid level is elevated, his glucose is low, CPK liver enzymes and BUN, they're all elevated.  ",9,18
"SCULLY: It points to a multi-system organ failure. Gradually, his body is consuming itself. It's been going on for months, and ... maybe even years.  ",9,18
"SCULLY: His doctors have no idea, but I think I'm starting to.  ",9,18
"SCULLY: And if so, it follows that the more he uses it, the more his health will decline ... until finally ...  ",9,18
"SCULLY: Oh, my God.  ",9,18
"SCULLY: Why goodbye, Oliver?  ",9,18
"SCULLY: Well, they're trying everything they can think of. Experimental drugs, plasma transfusion.  ",9,18
"SCULLY: They're the, uh, perfect family. And since Oliver didn't have one as a child, he ... created one.  ",9,18
"SCULLY: Well, what are you suggesting is the course of action, John?  ",9,18
"SCULLY: Me too. Well, maybe I've had it these past nine years. If not proof of the paranormal, then ... of more important things.  ",9,18
SCULLY: How long has he been here?  ,9,19
SCULLY: Who called you?  ,9,19
SCULLY: Who called them?  ,9,19
SCULLY: What for?  ,9,19
SCULLY: Mulder.  ,9,19
"SCULLY: Oh, my God.  ",9,19
"SCULLY: Am I okay? Mulder, I haven't seen you in such a long time.  ",9,19
SCULLY: I was so worried.  ,9,19
SCULLY: What's happened to you?  ,9,19
SCULLY: You're clear on what?  ,9,19
SCULLY: Mulder ...  ,9,19
SCULLY: (quietly) We're going to get you out of here.  ,9,19
SCULLY: And they have him believing that he did it.  ,9,19
SCULLY: Knowle Rohrer.  ,9,19
SCULLY: To beg mercy with the man upstairs.  ,9,19
SCULLY: Mulder.  ,9,19
SCULLY: Mulder!  ,9,19
"SCULLY: Oh, my ...  ",9,19
"SCULLY: Damn it, Mulder. It's not funny to see you putting on that act.  ",9,19
"SCULLY: Mulder, why are they doing this to you?  ",9,19
"SCULLY: Mulder, they're saying you killed a man.  ",9,19
"SCULLY: Mulder, we'll get you the best lawyer.  ",9,19
SCULLY: Mulder ...  ,9,19
SCULLY: What's the matter?  ,9,19
"SCULLY: Mulder, it's me.  ",9,19
SCULLY: No. That's why I'm here.  ,9,19
"SCULLY: Mulder, I need you to talk to me. Confide in me ... or we'll lose.  ",9,19
"SCULLY: You're scaring me. Mulder, I'm so scared that I've just got you back and now I'm going to lose you again.  ",9,19
SCULLY: Well ... whatever you're doing ... you have no idea how much has already been lost ... What I've had to do ...  ,9,19
"SCULLY: Our son, Mulder ... I gave him up.  ",9,19
SCULLY: Our son. I'm so afraid you could never forgive me.  ,9,19
"SCULLY:  God, where have you been? Where have you been hiding?  ",9,19
SCULLY: Doing what?  ,9,19
"SCULLY: You found something, didn't you? Huh?  ",9,19
SCULLY: What did you find?  ,9,19
"SCULLY: You found something in that facility? That's what you were doing, right? Mulder, what did you find out there?  ",9,19
SCULLY: That doesn't make sense.  ,9,19
SCULLY: My name is Dana Katherine Scully. I was assigned nine years ago to the X-Files to spy on Agent Mulder whose methods the FBI distrusted.  ,9,19
SCULLY: I came to believe in the existence of extraterrestrial life and in a conspiracy inside the government to keep their existence a secret.  ,9,19
SCULLY: I believe as do many respected scientists that life came to earth millions of years ago from a meteor or a rock from Mars.  ,9,19
SCULLY: I believe there was a virus which thrived here prehistorically. I believe that virus infected early man and transformed his physiology.  ,9,19
SCULLY: Into an alien life-form himself.  ,9,19
"SCULLY: They died in the last ice age, 35,000 years ago.  ",9,19
SCULLY: It lay dormant underground until it surfaced once again during our current geologic period.  ,9,19
"SCULLY: The government learned of this virus in 1947 when a UFO crashed in Roswell, New Mexico.  ",9,19
SCULLY: The virus thrived underground in petroleum deposits. In black oil. It has sentience. It can think. It has the ability to communicate and it communicated with the UFOs.  ,9,19
"SCULLY: In Roswell, they captured aliens from the spacecraft wreckage. They salvaged various alien technology from them and from their data banks they learned of the alien plan to ""re-colonize"" the earth.  ",9,19
SCULLY: They kept it a dark secret. If it had gotten out there would have been wild panic.  ,9,19
SCULLY: By the military working with the government conspirators to develop a breed of human-alien hybrids that the aliens would use as a slave race.  ,9,19
SCULLY: You're being facetious.  ,9,19
SCULLY: There are the mars rocks ...  ,9,19
SCULLY: I don't know what you mean.  ,9,19
"SCULLY: Make them a deal, Mulder. Guilty on a lesser charge. Maybe they'll go for it and they'll let you walk out of here.  ",9,19
"SCULLY: How can you say that? How can you say that, Mulder, to me?  ",9,19
"SCULLY: Well, then, expose it, Mulder! Take the stand. Whatever it is that you're withholding take the stand and hit them full force.  ",9,19
SCULLY: Why?  ,9,19
"SCULLY: You say this is greater than us, and maybe it is, but this is us fighting this fight, Mulder, not you. It's you and me. That's what I'm fighting for, Mulder. You and me.  ",9,19
SCULLY: You found him?  ,9,19
SCULLY: What are you talking about? There can't be a body; he can't die. Knowle Rohrer is a super soldier.  ,9,19
SCULLY: Who's saying it's him?  ,9,19
SCULLY: It's there now?  ,9,19
SCULLY: That's what it says here.  ,9,19
SCULLY: I need you to get me Knowle Rohrer's medical records.  ,9,19
"SCULLY: You've got to, Monica; whatever it takes. I need those records for Skinner. I need them for Mulder.  ",9,19
SCULLY: Assistant Director ...  ,9,19
SCULLY (to MULDER): I found it.  ,9,19
SCULLY: What's going to get you off.  ,9,19
SCULLY: You can't deny it.  ,9,19
SCULLY: You're in contempt. I have evidence proving that Agent Mulder is innocent.  ,9,19
SCULLY: Who was it?  ,9,19
SCULLY: Agent Doggett?  ,9,19
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,9,19
SCULLY: What's he doing?  ,9,19
"SCULLY: Mulder, Kersh told us to head north. You just got on a road going south.  ",9,19
SCULLY: Where are you going?  ,9,19
SCULLY: Mulder! What are you doing?  ,9,19
SCULLY: What are they?  ,9,19
"SCULLY: Yeah, Mulder, but what are we doing here?  ",9,19
"SCULLY: Mulder, what is it?  ",9,19
"SCULLY: I hoped and prayed you were dead you chain-smoking, son of a bitch.  ",9,19
SCULLY: Who?  ,9,19
SCULLY: You don't scare me.  ,9,19
"SCULLY: No, I want to hear it, Mulder.  ",9,19
SCULLY (o.s.): What are you thinking?  ,9,19
SCULLY: Mulder?  ,9,19
SCULLY: (softly) You don't believe that.  ,9,19
"SCULLY: You don't believe that, either.  ",9,19
SCULLY: You wouldn't tell me. Not because you were afraid or broken .... but because you didn't want to accept defeat.  ,9,19
"SCULLY: Why would I accept defeat? Why would I accept it, if you won't? Mulder, you say that you've failed but you only fail if you give up. And I know you -- you can't give up. It's what I saw in you when we first met. It's what made me follow you ... why I'd do it all over again.  ",9,19
"SCULLY: And what has it gotten you? Not your sister. Nothing that you've set out for. But you won't give up, even now.  ",9,19
SCULLY: You've always said that you want to believe. But believe in what Mulder? If this is the truth that you've been looking for then what is left to believe in?  ,9,19
SCULLY: Then we believe the same thing.  ,9,19
