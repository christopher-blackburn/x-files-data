## About

Being a major X-Files fan, I couldn't resist the opportunity to study elements of the show using natural language processing. In this repository, you will find some cool transcript data from the shows. Feel free to use. 


### Transcripts

The raw text data comes from the show's transcripts located on the [Inside-the-X](http://www.insidethex.co.uk/#one) website. Much respect and gratitude goes to the creators of those transcripts. The raw text data covers the episodes from the "original" series that aired up until 2002, and I have not included any spinoffs (The Lone Gunmen) or any of the X-Files movies.
