## About

Being a major X-Files fan, I couldn't resist the opportunity to study elements of the show using natural language processing. In this repository, you will find all of the code and data needed to replicate my analysis or conduct your own. If you choose to conduct your own analysis using the data, please consider citing me:

Blackburn, Christopher, "X-Files Topic Modeling", (2021), Github Repository. 


### Transcripts

The transcripts for the show come from the [Inside-the-X](http://www.insidethex.co.uk/#one) and much respect and gratitude goes to the creators of those transcripts.
